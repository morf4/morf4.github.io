									<h3 class="title">MDM (My Digital Movies)</h3>
									<p>I've hesitated in recommending any of the free movie cataloging apps because 
										I've found each one to be lacking when compared to shareware solutions. The app 
										to beat, in my mind, remains Delicious Library for Mac OS X users, but Windows 
										doesn't currently offering anything quite as elegant. I'm personally a huge fan 
										of <a href="http://www.jakeludington.com/downloads/20041211_movie_collector.html">Movie 
											Collector</a>, which means everything else gets compared to it. MDM comes 
										close to matching the features, which seems to be a challenge for free 
										applications. The wizard for adding new movies works as long as the movie 
										you're adding is in the Amazon catalog. The Loan Manager includes a reminder 
										system and a link to send email to let friends know you want your movies back, 
										which is helpful if you are the loaning type. The app tracks DVD, SVCD, VCD and 
										DivX as major category types, which is a testament to the popularity of the 
										digital format. A feature to play movies stored on your hard drive from the 
										application is useful if you store lots of movies on your hard drive. Searching 
										your existing library works quite well. Searching for movies originating in the 
										United States works like a charm. I tried some obscure titles and all of them 
										were found. The one criteria where this app doesn't perform well is in 
										cataloging foreign films. I'm a big fan of Chinese, Korean and Japanese cinema 
										and the Internet database used by MDM doesn't find many of my favorite films. 
										I'll be sticking with Movie Collector for the time being, but if you're seeking 
										an acceptable free alternative MDM gets my vote. [Windows 9x/2k/XP $0.00]</p>

									<h3 class="title">Restoring the Windows Volume Control</h3>
									<p>
									<p>This question popped up in my inbox more than once this week. Surprisingly, I've 
										never posted an answer publicly until now.</p>
									<p><i>The volume icon in my system tray isn't there anymore. It isn't one of the hidden 
											icons, it's actually gone. How do I get it back so I can easily access the 
											volume controls?</i></p>
									<p>You'll need to make a change in the Windows XP Control Panel for Sounds and 
										Audio Devices (or Sounds and Multimedia in 2000 and Me, or just plain 
										Multimedia in Win 98). Browse to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Sounds and Audio 
										Devices to get started.</p>

									<h3 class="title">Audio Fiction</h3>
									<p>Figuring out how to crack Apple codecs to make them playable outside the realm 
										of iTunes QuickTime seems to be a popular past time. The latest success in this 
										area involves the <a href="http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html">reverse 
											engineering of Apple's Lossless Codec</a>, which is a direct competitor to 
										the Windows Media Lossless format and more open formats like FLAC and Monkey's 
										Audio. At some point it would be great if all the codec companies would learn 
										to play nice and let us choose which player we want to listen to our audio in. 
										This project is another example of the Linux crowd wanting access to something 
										that the mainstream didn't bother to code for them. Ingenuity prevails and as a 
										result, I'm betting we see a better alternative to iTunes pop up in the coming 
										months. Possibly a new addition to the project that created Real Alternative.</p>

									<h3 class="title">Buying a DVD Recorder</h3>
									<p><i>I want to buy a DVD recorder with hard drive and the best editing features and 
											also frame specific like the editing I do on my VCR with the toggle. The 
											recorder needs to have mono, S-video and digital video input. Do you have any 
											advice?</i></p>
									<p>There are numerous options for DVD recording, both in the standalone consumer 
										device market and in the PC market. Choosing the right DVD recorder is somewhat 
										dependent on the type of source format you plan to work with, in addition to 
										where you plan to playback the recorded DVDs. I personally prefer using PC 
										based solutions for recording and managing digital video, but some of the DVD 
										Recorders in the consumer electronics space are equally capable.</p>

									<h3 class="title">Robot Stories</h3>
									<p><a href="http://www.shopping.com/xGS-Robot-Stories~NS-1~linkin_id-3068036" title="Compare prices for Robot Stories on Shopping.com "><img src="http://www.jakeludington.com/images/dvd/robotstories.jpg" align="left" border="0"
												alt="Robot Stories DVD"></a> Robot Stories is a series of four short 
										films loosely tied together by the common theme of human self-discovery through 
										technology. My Robot Baby takes place in a future where couples wanting to have 
										children must first make a test pass at parenting caring for a robot baby that 
										quickly learns from its environment. The story is disturbing both in 
										implications of the resulting behavior and the ultimate outcome. The Robot 
										Fixer has less to do with technology and more to do with human grieving as a 
										woman symbolically repairs her adult son's robot toys from his childhood as he 
										sinks further into a coma. Machine Love is a story of human realization and 
										cruelty through the eyes of an android office worker giving us an 
										outsider-looking-in point-of-view for seeing ourselves at our most vulnerable. 
										Clay deals with human frailty and the opportunity to transcend the end, instead 
										living on as a digital replica of your mind in a world where the body has 
										become a vessel designed to be a temporary home before we move on to an 
										everlasting next life still connected to this one. Each of the stories stands 
										alone and while this isn't sci-fi in its purist sense, it certainly fits the 
										man versus himself type conflict common to many stories in the genre. This is a 
										great addition to any movie collection and one of the few short film 
										collections I'd consider must-view material.</p>

									<h3 class="title">Marantz PMD660</h3>
									<p><img src="http://www.jakeludington.com/images/gadgets/marantzpmd660.jpg" border="0" align="left">
										I've been completely enamored with my portable Compact Flash recording <a href="http://www.shopping.com/xGS-Edirol-R-1~linkin_id-3068036" title="Marantz PMD670">
											Edirol R-1</a> ever since it arrived in the mail back in December. It 
										records outstandingly well, has a battery life I never would have expected from 
										something relying on AA batteries as a power source and so far, I've managed to 
										record everything I've needed to using only a 1GB card. There's one little 
										feature the R-1 lacks that could encourage me to upgrade to another recorder; 
										an XLR microphone connection. For about $60 more than the going rate for an 
										R-1, Marantz now offers PMD660, which is about the same size and also relies on 
										AA batteries for juice (4 batteries to the R-1's 2). It offers 16-bit 44.1kHz 
										or 48kHz WAV recording or MP3 recording, in combination with the two XLR inputs 
										on one side of the case. The PMD660 is slightly larger than the Edirol R-1 and 
										weighs more too, but it's still a handheld size unit. If XLR connections are 
										not a concern, I'd stick with the Edirol R-1 at a lower price and lighter 
										overall weight. On the other hand, after several months with the R-1, I'm 
										realizing the greater potential for noise in the recording thanks to the 
										required mini-plug adapter for converting a standard XLR microphone cable to 
										something that can plug into the tiny little jack. If you need even more 
										connection options and over the shoulder portability is good enough, there's 
										also the <a href="http://www.shopping.com/xGS-Marantz-PMD670~linkin_id-3068036" title="Marantz PMD670">
											Marantz PMD670</a>, which records to Compact Flash and offers RCA 
										connectors in addition to mini-plug and XLR options.</p>
