  <content>&lt;p&gt;
After going over the archives of the old blog. (man I can ramble). This is the current condtion of Sphinx Logic. There will be a SDK that you can apply for. And I&amp;#39;m giving the SDK out to the first 500 applicants. Also there will be a Framework which you can purchase. It will also be featured&amp;nbsp;at the Windows Marketplace site.&amp;nbsp;Also I would like to mention that Sphinx Logic is a Microsoft Partner. Have been since 2007. I will try to post things of importance and not just ramble. There are a couple of other products in the works as well. I will put all of the code snippets in the Code Sample section as well including the one&amp;#39;s from the old blog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
