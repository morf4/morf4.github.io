Now that we've set ourselves up with our Schrodinger equation, some basic mathematics of eigenfunctions,
orthogonality and completeness, and we've solved a fairly easy, but important problem
of the infinitely deep well or particle in a box, we can tackle some slightly more realistic
problems. And we're going to look at two important ones here.
First, we will look at a particle in a rectangular well of finite depth. This is quite a realistic
model for some quite practical situations. In fact, we come across this problem all the
time when designing various modern optoelectronic devices like semiconductor lasers and optical
modulators that are based on so-called quantum well layered semiconductor structures.
After looking at that problem, we will have a first look at the harmonic oscillator problem.
That is actually the problem of a particle in a parabolic-shaped potential well. This
problem is of very great use in quantum mechanics as it occurs for all sorts of oscillating
systems.
For the moment here as a start, we'll just be considering the non-oscillating aspects
of this system. We can handle both of these problems mathematically. Though compared to
the simple particle in the box, they take a bit more algebra than that problem does.
There are a few more problems that can be handled analytically. But for most more complicated
problems, we would just likely move over to solving them numerically and we will get to
that later.
These two specific problems though of the finite potential well and the harmonic oscillator
are both worth solving analytically, though because these analytic solutions can give
a significant insight, we're going to take some time to do them. The algebra is a bit
more complicated. And we will be able to use that insight in quantum mechanical systems
in general, as well as these particular problems being practically useful in their own right.
