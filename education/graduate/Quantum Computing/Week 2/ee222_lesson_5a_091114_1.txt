Now that we've set up the Schrodinger's equation, we can start using it. Here, we're going to
look at a very simple problem, the particle in a box. This will introduce many important
ideas in quantum mechanics, not the least of which is the idea of what people think
of as quantum behavior, the appearance of discrete states at very specific energy levels.
Along the way, we're going to see, also, some basic ideas in the mathematics we use for
quantum mechanics, ideas that will be at the core of quantum mechanics even as we move
on later to other kinds of problems. The mathematics here turns out to be quite simple and very
powerful.
