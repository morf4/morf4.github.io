Up to this point in our discussion, matrices have just been ways of writing done arrays
of numbers. However, the real power of matrices comes from their algebra. Since matrices are
a very economical way to write down the linear algebra that we encounter so often in science
and engineering, their algebra is particularly important, because of the simplification and
the generality that it brings. Quantum mechanics, in particular, turns out to be based completely
on linear algebra, as we already said.
To be able to use matrices -- as a very convenient way of writing down and working with linear
algebra -- we need to define their various algebraic properties.
Now, the algebra of matrices has many similarities to the algebra of ordinary numbers and variables.
But it does have some very important and consequential differences. And these differences give a
richness to the algebra that makes it particularly useful for describing linear physical systems.
We are going to look at the basic processes, here, showing how those processes with matrices
are similar to and different from our ordinary algebra. We will start with addition and subtraction
and then move on to the particularly important process of matrix multiplication. And that
is where matrices start to get their real power. We will end by discussing the inverse
of a matrix, briefly.
Now let's look at the simplest perhaps of the matrix operations, adding and subtracting
matrices. If two matrices are the same size, that is, if they have the same numbers of
rows and columns, we can add or subtract them simply by adding or subtracting the individual
matrix elements. And we do this one by one, on each of the elements.
So for example, if we have a matrix here like F, 1 and i, 2, 1 minus 3i as its elements
and similarly, another matrix, G, with its corresponding elements, then to add the two
of these together to get a new matrix, K, we simply add the elements in each matrix,
one by one. So 1 plus 5 gives us a new element for K, i plus 4i, here, 2 minus 6, here, and
1 minus 3i plus 7 plus 8i. And, of course, we can simplify that to get the result. So
that's very straightforward.
Now let's look at a somewhat more complicated, but very important, operation that we can
do with matrices, which is multiplication. And we're going to start that discussion by
taking a particular case, a simpler case, which is multiplying a vector by a matrix.
So suppose we want to multiply this column vector, here, by a matrix. The number of rows
in the vector, you will see here, must much the number of columns in the matrix. And this
is a general requirement for matrix-matrix multiplication -- is this matching of the
rows in one with the columns in the other. So you can see that the number of rows on
the right, which is 3, matches the number of columns on the left in the matrix, here,
which is also 3.
So how do we do this? Well, the first thing we do is we imagine that we take this vector
and put it sideways on top of the matrix. And then we multiply element by element.
So we have 7 times 1, which we have here, 8 times 2, which we have here, 9 times 3,
which we have here, and we add all of these up. And the result of that is 50. And that's
the number we put in here.
And this result, here, is going to be a vector. And the first element in the vector, this
top one, here, is the result of the product of this vector with that matrix. So we can
keep going, here. We can move down and repeat for the next row.
We move our 7, 8, and 9 down to multiply them. 7 times 4, 8 times 5, 9 times 6, and we have
all of these here. We add them up and get 122. And notice that we put this in the lower
element of this vector.
So we have 2 rows in this vector, which matches the 2 rows in the matrix. So here's our result,
just in shorter form. The 50 and 122 is the result of multiplying this vector by this
matrix.
And we can also write this in an algebraic form. If we think of this result vector, here,
as being vector d, and our input vector, here, on the right, as being vector c, and our matrix
as being matrix A, we can write d is equal to A times c, of course. And we can also write
this out in a summation notation.
So the dm, here, are the elements of this vector. So there's 2 of them. So m runs 1
and 2. The cn here are the elements of this vector, 1, 2, and 3. And you see what we're
doing here -- we're summing over n -- cn times Amn.
So for the first row, the m is going to be 1. So we're multiplying the elements in the
first row, m equals 1, by their corresponding elements in the vector, Amn times cn. So this
is Am1, Am2, Am3.
And note that the summation in this notation is over the repeated index. So we've chosen
to sum over n here, but see that that is also a repeated index in the sum. So this expression,
here, is just the same as the operations that we've just done.
Now we can keep going, here, to the more general case of multiplying a matrix by a matrix.
So here is a matrix and another matrix. And we're multiplying this one by this one. And
here is our result.
The first column in this matrix, here, is the same as the vector we were just working
with. This matrix is the same as the matrix we just worked with. So these first two elements,
here, on the left column, are, indeed, the ones we just worked out.
This one here, the 14, is the result of taking this vector, 1, 2, 3, laying it across the
top, doing 1 times 1 plus 2 times 2 plus 3 times 3. And that gives you 14. And similarly,
the 32 is 1 times 4 plus 2 times 5 plus 3 times 6.
So you see that the results in this first column, here, are the ones that we get from
the first column of this matrix on the right. And the ones in the second column are the
ones that we get from the second column in the matrix on the right.
So as we've just done, we see that what we do is we repeat our operation for each column
in the matrix on the right, working from left to right to work from left to right in the
result. And we write down the answers as the elements in this matrix, here, also working
from left to right.
Again, we can write this algebraically. Here is our result matrix-- equal to matrix B multiplying
matrix A. We call this matrix A. This is matrix B.
And in summation notation, we get something exactly analogous to what we just got for
the matrix vector multiplication. We're looking here at the mp-th element of this matrix.
So, for example, for m equals 1, p equals 1. That's this element, here.
And we are collecting for each column, here -- we choose a specific column, column p,
for example -- you see, we are doing the same thing as we did for our vector matrix multiplication.
And we're summing over the repeated index, n, in the middle. So the elements with p equals
1 are just this column of numbers here. And we're doing the same thing as we did before
to generate this element and so on.
A particular special case of matrix-matrix multiplication is the rather simple one of
vector-vector products. And we're going to work with these to point out some of the things
that happen when you take vector-vector products, which turn out to be quite interesting.
If we take 2 vectors, like this, a column vector on the right and a row vector on the
left, and we see, doing our matrix-vector multiplication here, with this as our matrix,
we're going to do 4 times 1 plus 5 times 2 plus 6 times 3. But the net result of that
is just 1 number. So this particular vector-vector product of a column vector on the right and
a row vector on the left collapses everything to just 1 number. And this is sometimes called
an inner product, and it's completely analogous to the geometrical vector product.
In fact, this could actually be a geometrical vector product. If 4, 5, and 6 were the components
in the x, y, and z directions of an actual geometrical vector, and 1, 2, and 3 were the
components in the x, y, and z directions of another geometrical vector, then this result,
here, would, in fact, be the dot product of these 2 geometrical vectors. The algebra's
actually the same.
Again, we can do this algebraically. We can have this number, here, f equal to a vector,
in this case, a row vector and a column vector multiplied together. Note that, here, we are
running into a slight notation problem. And I'm using ordinary letters both for numbers
and for vectors. Later on, we'll get to a different notation called the Dirac notation
that gets past that particular confusion.
And then, again, we can write this in summation form, here, which turns out to be particularly
simple. We, again, are summing over the repeated index. And the result, here, is just this
1 number.
In contrast, if we multiply the vectors the other way around, so we put the row vector
over here and the column vector here, then when we multiply the 2 of these together in
this order, we actually generate a complete matrix, here. And in this matrix, 1 times
4 gives us this 4, here, 2 times 4 gives us this 8, here, 3 times 4 gives us this 12,
here, and so on. And this product is sometimes called an outer product with the 2 vectors
combining in such a way as to give us this entire matrix. It's the opposite of what happened
with the inner product, where they combined to give us just 1 number down here.
And again, we can write this out in algebraic form. So now we're forming a new matrix, F,
here. And it's a product of the column vector, d, and the row vector, c. And again, this
notation is a little insufficient, because it's not making it clear whether either of
these is a row or column vector. But we know they are from here.
And the net result of that is that the mpth element of this matrix is the product of the
mth element of the column matrix times the pth element of the row matrix.
Matrix algebra has many similar properties to the algebra of ordinary numbers and one
very important difference. So first of all, matrix algebra, like normal algebra, is associative.
So it does not matter where I put the parentheses, here, whether I put them around the C and
the B or around the B and the A. That is, I could multiply C and B together and then
have them multiply A, or I could multiply B and A together and then multiply C by that
result. It does not matter which one of these we do.
It also has the same kind of distributive properties that we're used to from normal
algebra. So A times the sum of B plus C is equal to AB plus AC.
But matrix algebra is not, in general, commutative. That is, in general, it's not the case that
if we take 2 matrices, A and B, that the product B times A is equal to the product A times
B. Now it is possible that for some matrices this may be true, but it's not true, in general.
And this is easily proved with a simple example.
For example, if we take these 2 matrices, here, and multiply them together in this order,
we'll get the following result. But if we take the same matrices but multiply it in
the other order, so this one is now here and that one is now here, then the answer is simply
different. So we are proving, by example, that, in general, B times A is not equal to
A times B.
Whether or not any 2 specific matrices commute, that is, whether A times B is the same thing
as B times A, turns out to have some major mathematical consequences for the 2 matrices
and their shared properties. The fact that matrix multiplication is not, in general,
commutative is extremely important in allowing matrices to be at the core of the way we describe
quantum mechanics. And it has profound consequences in the physics.
The fact that some specific matrices do commute with one another, that is, we can swap the
order of multiplication, also has very specific consequences in the physics. We are going
to return to these topics in our discussion of quantum mechanics.
Multiplying a matrix by a number turns out to be very straightforward. It means, basically,
that we must multiply every element of the matrix by that number. So for example, the
number 2 multiplying this matrix, here, simply means we go in and multiply each element of
the matrix by the number 2.
Also, similarly, we can do the opposite. We can take a common factor out from every element,
in the end multiplying the matrix by that factor instead. So if we had started out with
what was this matrix, here, if we start out with this matrix, we can, rather obviously,
take out the factor of 2 from all of these elements and put it out front.
And if we want to do a formal proof, we use the summation notation. In fact, that's generally
true. If we really want to prove things for matrices, we tend to write them out algebraically,
using the summation notation, if we want to get a very clear result.
So for example, we can show how to do a proof for this idea that we can separate out this
factor from the matrix, or we can introduce it, one way or the other. We presume that
we're going to take this matrix A, here, and have it multiply an arbitrary vector. And
we're going to look at the vector we get as a result. And that's a way of proving things
for some matrix or operator, here. To prove equalities of one kind or another, we can
prove them by having them operate -- the matrix here operate on an arbitrary vector, and show
that it works for any arbitrary vector.
So here, for example, we've got our matrix, A, multiplying the vector, c. And we're multiplying
the whole thing by some number, alpha. And the result of that is some vector.
Now because these entities, here, are all just numbers, we can move this alpha in here,
put it inside the summation. That's a normal operation with numbers. A times the sum of
a bunch of numbers is the same as the sum of A times each number. That's really a distributive
property.
And consequently, we can move this alpha, here, formally inside the sum. And then if
we want, we can put parentheses around this pair of terms inside the sum. And this, here,
is just a number that we can call a matrix element of another matrix, Bmn.
So this is a rather trivial proof, but I've formally proved that you can take this alpha
that was outside the matrix and, instead, multiply every element of the matrix. So I've
essentially proved that this works. It's a very trivial proof, but it shows the kind
of way that we can prove things using summation notation. So formally, this matrix element
Bmn is alpha times the matrix element Amn.
Now in multiplying a matrix by a number, we know, of course, that number multiplication
is commutative. So if we have some product of numbers and matrices, we can simply move
factors around, arbitrarily, in matrix products.
So for example, if we've got a number, alpha, and a vector, c, then alpha times A, matrix
A, times the matrix, B, times the vector, c, means we can move this around. We can move
the alpha around inside here. Since it was just multiplying every element of this, we
can also take that out and put it on the other side, and so on. And we can keep on moving
the numbers around inside here as much as we want. So alpha times A times B times c
is the same thing as A times B times alpha times c.
But notice, we've not moved the order of the matrices around. But we can move numbers around.
And again, if we want to formally prove something like this, it's pretty straightforward to
do so, using the summation notation.
Now, something that comes up quite a lot in the algebra of matrices and linear operators,
generally, is we often have to take the Hermitian adjoint of a product of 2 matrices. And the
Hermitian adjoint of a product turns out to be the reversed product of the Hermitian adjoints.
So if we had a product of 2 matrices here, A and B, and we wanted to take the Hermitian
adjoint of that product, then it turns out that it's equal to the product of the Hermitian
adjoint of B times the Hermitian adjoint of A.
And again, this is something that we can prove using summation notation. So let's just do
this as an exercise, using the summation notation.
Let's suppose that the matrix, R, is the product of the matrices A and B, in this order, so
that the matrix element Rmp is the sum over n of the product of the mnth element of A
times npth element of B. So if we look at the pm element of this Hermitian adjoint of
this product here, by definition, here, it must be the pm element of this matrix R adjoint,
R Hermitian adjoint. And the pm-th element of R Hermitian adjoint is the complex conjugate
of the mp-th element, and that's the definition of taking the Hermitian adjoint.
So therefore, the pm-th element of this matrix must be the mp-th element of R complex conjugate
of that element. And that, of course, is just Amn Bnp summed over n and complex conjugated.
Which we can rewrite like this, because the complex conjugate of a product is the product
of the complex conjugates. But this element, here, A star mn, would be the nm-th element
of the matrix A dagger, A Hermitian adjoint. And similarly, the complex conjugate of the
np-th element of B would be the pn-th element of the Hermitian adjoint of B.
These are just numbers, so we can swap them around. And, of course, this is just the matrix
product of B dagger times A dagger, as we have here, the pm-th element of that. So we've
shown that the pm-th element of this matrix is the same as the pm-th element of that matrix.
So therefore, because this is true for any choice of p and m in the matrix, we have proved
our result, up here.
One final topic in matrix algebra here is the inverse of a matrix. In normal algebra,
as well as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we have division. In matrix algebra, though,
there is no operation of division as such.
We do have a concept, however, that can perform some of the functions of division, which is
taking the inverse of a matrix. With numbers, the closest analogy is the reciprocal, which
is 1 over a number. 1 over some number is the reciprocal.
We know that for the number 0, there is no meaningful reciprocal. 1 over 0 is not defined.
But otherwise, division and reciprocals are meaningful and useful for numbers.
Now, many matrices do have an inverse. But there are also many matrices that do not.
The conditions under which matrices do or do not have inverses are quite an important
part of the mathematics of matrices. And we will also be returning to this later.
So let's look at the inverse of a matrix and what, specifically, we mean by that, algebraically.
For ordinary algebra, the reciprocal or inverse of a number or variable x is simply 1 over
x. So we might write that as x to the minus 1. Now, it's not clear what we would mean
by 1 over a matrix, so we can't use that notation. However, we will try to make some use of a
notation like this.
Anyway, for ordinary numbers, this quantity, x to the minus 1 times x, is the same thing
as x over x, and it equals 1. For a matrix then, what we say is the following. If a matrix
does have an inverse, we'll write that as A to the minus 1. It will have the property
-- and this is really a definition of our inverse here -- that A to the minus 1 times
A will equal the identity matrix. So whereas x to the minus 1 times x equal the number
1, for the matrices, we're writing something similar, that A to the minus 1, if it exists,
times A is equal to this idea or concept that we call the identity matrix.
And the identity matrix is the diagonal matrix. That is, a matrix with only elements down
its diagonal and 0 everywhere else. And in the case of the identity matrix, the elements
on the diagonal are all 1. So the identity matrix has 1's down its diagonal and 0's everywhere
else. For example, the 3 by 3 identity matrix would look like this, here -- 1's down the
diagonal and 0's everywhere else.
Now when we're doing a multiplication with the identity matrix, the multiplication will
not make any sense unless we've chosen the identity matrix to be the right size. So we
don't even need to bother saying how large the identity matrix is, because it obviously
has to be the one that's the right size so we can do the multiplication. So we do not
usually bother to be explicit about what the size of the identity matrix is. But obviously,
there are lots of different identity matrices, depending on what dimension or what size of
matrix we're talking about.
For any matrix, A, we can write A times I, here, is equal to A. Or we can write I times
A is equal to A. This is really the definition of the identity matrix.
Like the number 1 in ordinary algebra, it seems, on the face of it perhaps, that the
identity matrix is almost a trivial idea. But, in fact, it's very important. And just
as the number 1 is very important in ordinary algebra, so also the identity matrix is very
important in matrix algebra.
