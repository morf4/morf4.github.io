Here we're going to introduce the important and very useful mathematics of matrices. Now,
at first matrices may seem rather abstract, but, in fact, they turn out to be a very concrete
way of representing the whole field of the mathematics of linear algebra. And a very
important point is that because the mathematics of quantum mechanics is based, essentially,
entirely on linear algebra, matrix algebra is particularly useful to us here.
Of course, the use of matrices for calculations in many branches of science and engineering
is extremely common. Here, though, we will mostly just go through the basics of matrices
and matrix algebra, and we won't to get into the details of how to handle matrices numerically,
for example. We'll be mostly concentrating on the principles and concepts of matrices.
