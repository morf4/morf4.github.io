Now that we've introduced the idea of differentiation, especially finding slopes and curvatures of
functions, we will move on to differential equations. We need these because very often
the behavior of some physical system depends on that slope or curvature of some physical
property. A classic example of that is waves. What happens to a wave next-- you might see
a wave on the surface of water-- depends upon the shape of it now.
We will start here with ordinary differential equations, as they're called, involving the
derivatives of a function of one variable. Then we will move on to differential equations
for functions of more than one variable, such as, for example, position and time. Those
would be two different variables.
And these will require partial derivatives. And the resulting differential equations are
therefore called partial differential equations. They are, however, a simple extension of the
ideas we will examine first with our ordinary differential equations in one variable.
