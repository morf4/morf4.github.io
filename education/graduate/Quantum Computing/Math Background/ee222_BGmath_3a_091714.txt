To think about things in space, we need coordinate systems. We're all familiar with the ideas
of axes at right angles. We call those Cartesian coordinates. And we will review those.
The idea of vectors is very important for talking about many things we need in describing
the physical world, such as velocities and forces. And we will review the ideas of vectors
and the operations we can perform on them and with them. This will also introduce some
very important ideas that we are going to generalize later on for quantum mechanics,
such as the ideas of things being at right angles, or more generally, what we might call
orthogonal.
