We're going to look here, first, at some other very useful notations. We need a simple way
of writing that we're going to add up various terms or numbers. So we need what's called
the summation notation.
Similarly, we also sometimes need a way of writing the product of many numbers or terms,
and that leads to a very analogous notation -- the product notation. One very specific
product -- that of a sequence of integers numbers -- has its own notation called the
factorial. We will go through all of these notations fairly quickly here.
Then we're going to introduce the important idea of power series. These allow us to make
simple and important approximations to functions. Approximations that often exposed to us what
is really going on in some situation. In particular, they clarify for us what we can call the order
of an approximation, which will also enable us to sort out what otherwise could be very
complicated situations in physics and engineering.
