Here we're going to discuss the idea of integral calculus, or integration. Integration is the
opposite process to differentiation, where differentiation relates to the difference
between the values of a function for adjacent values of the argument. As in going up a hill,
we're looking at the slope, which is the difference in the heights of hill.
We use integration, when we want to find the total amount of something, because integration
relates to the sum of the values of a function for adjacent values, not the difference like
a derivative. So with integration, we might be looking at, say, the total area under some
curve, or the total amount, say, of some smoke in a cloud or the total mass of an object,
given that we know its density.
In this section, we're going to formally introduce the ideas of integration and the various notations
used. We will start with one dimensional integration, as in finding the area under a curve, and
then we'll move onto volume integrals as in finding, as I said, the total mass of something
from its density and its shape. Now, we're not going to get into the various formulas
and techniques for evaluating specific integrals, and, as you likely remember, unlike differentiation,
where it's relatively easy to find the derivatives with very large range of functions using some
simple results of the formulas, integration can be harder, unless we can manage to see
what function could have been differentiated to give us the function we're trying to integrate.
The good news is that currently there are many mathematical programs and tables that
can give us the analytic results to integrals though.
