ALLAN ADAMS: Hi everyone.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,100
Welcome to 804 for spring 2013.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,542
This is the fourth, and
presumably final time

13
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,000
that I will be
teaching this class.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,070
So I'm pretty excited about it.

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,470
So my name is Allan Adams.

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,480
I'll be lecturing the course.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,470
I'm an assistant
professor in Course 8.

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,400
I study string theory
and its applications

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,290
to gravity, quantum gravity,
and condensed matter physics.

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,020
Quantum mechanics, this is a
course in quantam mechanics.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,890
Quantam mechanics Is
my daily language.

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,700
Quantum mechanics
is my old friend.

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,560
I met quantum
mechanics 20 years ago.

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,500
I just realized that last night.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,583
It was kind of depressing.

26
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,910
So, old friend.

27
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,490
It's also my most powerful tool.

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,860
So I'm pretty psyched about it.

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,230
Our recitation instructors
are Barton Zwiebach, yea!

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,875
And Matt Evans-- yea!

31
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,750
Matt's new to the
department, so welcome him.

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,384
Hi.

33
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,050
So he just started
his faculty position,

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,840
which is pretty awesome.

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,830
And our TA is Paolo Glorioso.

36
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,851
Paolo, are you here?

37
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:30,350
Yea!

38
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,891
There you go.

39
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:35,990
OK, so he's the person to
send all complaints to.

40
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,070
So just out of curiosity, how
many of you all are Course 8?

41
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,570
Awesome.

42
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,350
How many of you all
are, I don't know, 18?

43
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,150
Solid.

44
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,940
6?

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,240
Excellent.

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,170
9?

47
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,420
No one?

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,670
This is the first year we
haven't had anyone Course 9.

49
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,295
That's a shame.

50
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,254

51
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:58,670
Last year one of
the best students

52
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,720
was a Course 9 student.

53
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,820
So two practical things to know.

54
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,020
The first thing is
everything that we put out

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,140
will be on the Stellar website.

56
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,090
Lecture notes, homeworks,
exams, everything

57
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,690
is going to be done through
Stellar, including your grades.

58
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,930
The second thing
is that as you may

59
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,900
notice there are rather
more lights than usual.

60
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,830
I'm wearing a mic.

61
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,130
And there are these signs up.

62
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,040
We're going to be
videotaping this course

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,820
for the lectures for OCW.

64
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,649
And if you're happy
with that, cool.

65
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,190
If not, just sit on
the sides and you

66
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,690
won't appear anywhere on video.

67
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,375
Sadly, I can't do that.

68
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,120
But you're welcome
to if you like.

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,630
But hopefully that should
not play a meaningful role

70
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,670
in any of the lectures.

71
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,480

72
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,170
So the goal of 804 is for you
to learn quantum mechanics.

73
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,860
And by learn
quantum mechanics, I

74
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,340
don't mean to learn
how to do calculations,

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,384
although that's an important
and critical thing.

76
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,550
I mean learn some intuition.

77
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,049
I want you to develop
some intuition

78
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,710
for quantum phenomena.

79
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,400
Now, quantam
mechanics is not hard.

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,875
It has a reputation
for being a hard topic.

81
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,585
It is not a super hard topic.

82
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:10,460

83
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,280
So in particular,
everyone in this room,

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,480
I'm totally positive, can
learn quantum mechanics.

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,880
It does require
concerted effort.

86
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,690
It's not a trivial topic.

87
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,060
And in order to really
develop a good intuition,

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,390
the essential thing
is to solve problems.

89
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,960
So the way you develop
a new intuition

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,420
is by solving problems
and by dealing

91
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,930
with new situations, new
context, new regimes, which

92
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,410
is what we're
going to do in 804.

93
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,350
It's essential that you work
hard on the problem sets.

94
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,870
So your job is to devote
yourself to the problem sets.

95
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,660
My job is to convince you
at the end of every lecture

96
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,910
that the most interesting
thing you could possibly

97
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,600
do when you leave
is the problem set.

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,340
So you decide who
has the harder job.

99
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,100
So the workload is not so bad.

100
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,390
So we have problem
sets due, they're

101
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,650
due in the physics box in
the usual places, by lecture,

102
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,820
by 11 AM sharp on
Tuesdays every week.

103
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,099
Late work, no, not so much.

104
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,890
But we will drop one
problem set to make up

105
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,899
for unanticipated events.

106
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,399
We'll return the
graded problem sets

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
a week later in recitation.

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
Should be easy.

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,340
I strongly, strongly
encourage you

110
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,950
to collaborate with other
students on your problem sets.

111
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,290
You will learn more,
they will learn more,

112
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,740
it will be more efficient.

113
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,000
Work together.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,222
However, write your
problem sets yourself.

115
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:39,180
That's the best way for
you to develop and test

116
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,971
your understanding.

117
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,360

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,280
There will be two midterms,
dates to be announced,

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,480
and one final.

120
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,410
I guess we could have
multiple, but that

121
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,902
would be a little exciting.

122
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,360
We're going to use clickers,
and clickers will be required.

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,818
We're not going to
take attendance,

124
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:56,530
but they will give
a small contribution

125
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,460
to your overall grade.

126
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,260
And we'll use them
most importantly

127
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,770
for non-graded but just
participation concept questions

128
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,030
and the occasional in class
quiz to probe your knowledge.

129
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,340
This is mostly so that
you have a real time

130
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,240
measure of your own conceptual
understanding of the material.

131
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,000
This has been
enormously valuable.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,750
And something I want
to say just right off

133
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,800
is that the way I've
organized this class

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,760
is not so much based on
the classes I was taught.

135
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,630
It's based to the degree
possible on empirical lessons

136
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,150
about what works
in teaching, what

137
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,000
actually makes you learn better.

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,440
And clickers are an
excellent example of that.

139
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,440
So this is mostly a
standard lecture course,

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
but there will be clickers used.

141
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,020
So by next week I need
you all to have clickers,

142
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,760
and I need you to register
them on the TSG website.

143
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,040

144
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,980
I haven't chosen a
specific textbook.

145
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,940
And this is discussed
on the Stellar web page.

146
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,440
There are a set of textbooks,
four textbooks that I strongly

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,020
recommend, and a set of others
that are nice references.

148
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,830
The reason for this is twofold.

149
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,545
First off, there
are two languages

150
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:03,780
that are canonically used
for quantum mechanics.

151
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,460
One is called wave
mechanics, and the language,

152
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,980
the mathematical language is
partial differential equations.

153
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,500
The other is a matrix mechanics.

154
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,210
They have big names.

155
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,880
And the language there
is linear algebra.

156
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,420
And different books
emphasize different aspects

157
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,392
and use different languages.

158
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,350
And they also try to aim
at different problems.

159
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,790
Some books are
aimed towards people

160
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,710
who are interested in materials
science, some books that

161
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,910
are aimed towards people
interested in philosophy.

162
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,550
And depending on
what you want, get

163
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,300
the book that's suited to you.

164
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,540
And every week I'll be providing
with your problem sets readings

165
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,287
from each of the
recommended texts.

166
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:40,870
So what I really encourage you
to do is find a group of people

167
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,810
to work with every
week, and make sure

168
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,400
that you've got all the
books covered between you.

169
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
This'll give you as
much access to the texts

170
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,960
as possible without forcing
you to buy four books, which

171
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,746
I would discourage
you from doing.

172
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,440

173
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
So finally I guess
the last thing to say

174
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,610
is if this stuff
were totally trivial,

175
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,020
you wouldn't need to be here.

176
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,120
So ask questions.

177
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,005
If you're confused
about something,

178
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,380
lots of other
people in the class

179
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,680
are also going to be confused.

180
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,096
And if I'm not answering your
question without you asking,

181
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,730
then no one's getting
the point, right?

182
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,794
So ask questions.

183
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:14,960
Don't hesitate to interrupt.

184
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,860
Just raise your hand, and I
will do my best to call on you.

185
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,660
And this is true
for both in lecture,

186
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,840
also go to office
hours and recitations.

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,400
Ask questions.

188
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,970
I promise, there's no such
thing as a terrible question.

189
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,560
Someone else will
also be confused.

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,860
So it's a very valuable
to me and everyone else.

191
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,180

192
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,840
So before I get going
on the actual physics

193
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,770
content of the class, are there
any other practical questions?

194
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,272
Yeah.

195
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,230
AUDIENCE: You said there
was a lateness policy.

196
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:45,930
ALLAN ADAMS: Lateness policy.

197
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,429
No late work is
accepted whatsoever.

198
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,970

199
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,429
So the deal is given that
every once in a while,

200
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:53,970
you know, you'll be
walking to school

201
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,386
and your leg is
going to fall off,

202
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:58,800
or a dog's going to jump out
and eat your person standing

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,370
next to you, whatever.

204
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,250
Things happen.

205
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,960
So we will drop your
lowest problem set score

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,877
without any questions.

207
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,251
At the end of the
semester, we'll

208
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,600
just dropped your lowest score.

209
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,139
And if you turn
them all in, great,

210
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,680
whatever your lowest
score was, fine.

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,550
If you missed one, then gone.

212
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,350
On the other hand, if
you know next week, I'm

213
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,160
going to be attacked
by a rabid squirrel,

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
it's going to be
horrible, I don't

215
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,992
want to have to worry
about my problem set.

216
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:21,950
Could we work this out?

217
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,690
So if you know ahead
of time, come to us.

218
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,010
But you need to do that
well ahead of time.

219
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,510
The night before doesn't count.

220
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,770
OK?

221
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,330
Yeah.

222
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,294
AUDIENCE: Will we be
able to watch the videos?

223
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:31,770
ALLAN ADAMS: You know,
that's an excellent question.

224
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,700
I don't know.

225
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,780
I don't think so.

226
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,179
I think it's going to happen
at the end of the semester.

227
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,419
Yeah.

228
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:37,919
OK.

229
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,370
So no, you'll be able to watch
them later on the OCW website.

230
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,120

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,020
Other questions.

232
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,730
Yeah.

233
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,697
AUDIENCE: Are there
any other videos

234
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:51,270
that you'd recommend, just
like other courses on YouTube?

235
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,950
ALLAN ADAMS: Oh.

236
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,440
That's an interesting question.

237
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,156
I don't off the top of my head,
but if you send me an email,

238
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:57,780
I'll pursue it.

239
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,720
Because I do know several
other lecture series

240
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,030
that I like very
much, but I don't

241
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,090
know if they're available
on YouTube or publicly.

242
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,380
So send me an email
and I'll check.

243
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,910
Yeah.

244
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,870
AUDIENCE: So how about
the reading assignments?

245
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,453
ALLAN ADAMS: Reading assignments
on the problem set every week

246
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,150
will be listed.

247
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,750
There will be equivalent
reading from every textbook.

248
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,250
And if there is
something missing,

249
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,791
like if no textbook
covers something,

250
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,074
I'll post a separate reading.

251
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,240
Every once in a while, I'll
post auxiliary readings,

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,430
and they'll be available
on the Stellar website.

253
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,209
So for example, in your problem
set, first one was posted,

254
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,000
will be available
immediately after lecture

255
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,300
on the Stellar website.

256
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,230
There are three papers
that it refers to, or two,

257
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,880
and they are posted
on the Stellar website

258
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,070
and linked from the problem set.

259
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,570
Others?

260
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,090

261
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,750
OK.

262
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,800
So the first lecture.

263
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,590
The content of the physics
of the first lecture

264
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,040
is relatively standalone.

265
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,550
It's going to be an introduction
to a basic idea then is

266
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,800
going to haunt,
plague, and charm us

267
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,175
through the rest
of the semester.

268
00:09:57,175 --> 00:10:00,580

269
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,560
The logic of this
lecture is based

270
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,257
on a very beautiful discussion
in the first few chapters

271
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:07,340
of a book by David Albert
called Quantum Mechanics

272
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,200
and Experience.

273
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
It's a book for philosophers.

274
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,529
But the first few chapters,
a really lovely introduction

275
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,570
at a non-technical level.

276
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,361
And I encourage you to
take a look at them,

277
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,460
because they're very lovely.

278
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,710
But it's to be sure
straight up physics.

279
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,390

280
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,180
Ready?

281
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,550
I love this stuff.

282
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,290
today I want to describe
to you a particular set

283
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,860
of experiments.

284
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,460
Now, to my mind, these are the
most unsettling experiments

285
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,370
ever done.

286
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,900
These experiments
involve electrons.

287
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,230
They have been performed,
and the results

288
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,110
as I will describe
them are true.

289
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,890
I'm going to focus on two
properties of electrons.

290
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,570
I will call them
color and hardness.

291
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,440

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,054
And these are not
the technical names.

293
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:09,220
We'll learn the technical
names for these properties

294
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,380
later on in the semester.

295
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,470
But to avoid distracting you
by preconceived notions of what

296
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,330
these things mean, I'm going
to use ambiguous labels, color

297
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,240
and hardness.

298
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:27,320
And the empirical fact is that
every electron, every electron

299
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,450
that's ever been observed
is either black or white

300
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,670
and no other color.

301
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,300
We've never seen
a blue electron.

302
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,970
There are no green electrons.

303
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,950
No one has ever found
a fluorescent electron.

304
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,860
They're either black,
or they are white.

305
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,400
It is a binary property.

306
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,150
Secondly, their hardness
is either hard or soft.

307
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,240
They're never squishy.

308
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,570
No one's ever found
one that dribbles.

309
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,210
They are either hard,
or they are soft.

310
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,940
Binary properties.

311
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,820
OK?

312
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,170
Now, what I mean
by this is that it

313
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,620
is possible to
build a device which

314
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,580
measures the color
and the hardness.

315
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,500
In particular, it
is possible to build

316
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,652
a box, which I will call a color
box, that measures the color.

317
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,860
And the way it works is this.

318
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,460
It has three apertures,
an in port and two out

319
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,734
ports, one which sends
out black electrons

320
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,400
and one which sends
out white electrons.

321
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,430

322
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,090
And the utility of this
box is that the color

323
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,260
can be inferred
from the position.

324
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,360
If you find the particle,
the electron over here,

325
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,670
it is a white electron.

326
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,480
If you find the electron
here, it is a black electron.

327
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Cool?

328
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,460
Similarly, we can
build a hardness box,

329
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,700
which again has three
apertures, an in port.

330
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:59,050
And hard electrons
come out this port,

331
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,660
and soft electrons
come out this port.

332
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:10,430

333
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,460
Now, if you want, you're free
to imagine that these boxes are

334
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:20,440
built by putting
a monkey inside.

335
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,980
And you send in an
electron, and the monkey,

336
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,150
you know, with the ears,
looks at the electron,

337
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,996
and says it's a hard electron,
it sends it out one way,

338
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:31,120
or it's a soft electron,
it sends it out the other.

339
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,894
The workings inside
do not matter.

340
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,560
And in particular,
later in the semester

341
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
I will describe in
considerable detail

342
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
the workings inside
this apparatus.

343
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,630
And here's something I
want to emphasize to you.

344
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,569
It can be built in
principle using monkeys,

345
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:46,610
hyper intelligent monkeys
that can see electrons.

346
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,549
It could also be built using
magnets and silver atoms.

347
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,840
It could be done with neutrons.

348
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,256
It could be done with all sorts
of different technologies.

349
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,680
And they all give
precisely the same results

350
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,990
as I'm about to describe.

351
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,830
They all give precisely
the same results.

352
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,080
So it does not
matter what's inside.

353
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,640
But if you want a
little idea, you

354
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,350
could imagine putting a monkey
inside, a hyper intelligent

355
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,128
monkey.

356
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,550
I know, it sounds good.

357
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,290

358
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,930
So a key property of these
hardness boxes and color boxes

359
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,330
is that they are repeatable.

360
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,460
And here's what I mean by that.

361
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,040
If I send in an electron,
and I find that it comes out

362
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,702
of a color box black, and
then I send it in again,

363
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,410
then if I send it into
another color box,

364
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,605
it comes out black again.

365
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:38,810

366
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,660
So in diagrams, if I send
in some random electron

367
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,120
to a color box, and I discover
that it comes out, let's say,

368
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,840
the white aperture.

369
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,520
And so here's dot dot dot, and
I take the ones that come out

370
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
the white aperture, and I send
them into a color box again.

371
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,091
Then with 100% confidence,
100% of the time, the electron

372
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:04,340
coming out of the white port
incident on the color box

373
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,980
will come out the
white aperture again.

374
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,760
And 0% of the time will it
come out the black aperture.

375
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,536
So this is a
persistent property.

376
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,660
You notice that it's white.

377
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,814
You measure it again,
it's still white.

378
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,480
Do a little bit later,
it's still white.

379
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,370
OK?

380
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,650
It's a persistent property.

381
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,700
Ditto the hardness.

382
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,856
If I send in a bunch of
electrons in to a hardness box,

383
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:26,980
here is an important thing.

384
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,270
Well, send them
into a hardness box,

385
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,330
and I take out the ones
that come out soft.

386
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,280
And I send them again
into a hardness box,

387
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,180
and they come out soft.

388
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,390
They will come
out soft with 100%

389
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,040
confidence, 100% of the time.

390
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,940
Never do they come
out the hard aperture.

391
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:52,844

392
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,010
Any questions at this point?

393
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,802

394
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,010
So here's a natural question.

395
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:07,070

396
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:13,530
Might the color and the hardness
of an electron be related?

397
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:18,280
And more precisely,
might they be correlated?

398
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,460
Might knowing the color infer
something about the hardness?

399
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,530
So for example, so being
male and being a bachelor

400
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,749
are correlated properties,
because if you're male,

401
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,540
you don't know if you're
a bachelor or not,

402
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,123
but if you're a
bachelor, you're male.

403
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,870
That's the definition
of the word.

404
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,850
So is it possible that
color and hardness

405
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,110
are similarly correlated?

406
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,970
So, I don't know, there
are lots of good examples,

407
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,651
like wearing a red shirt and
beaming down to the surface

408
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:46,150
and making it back
to the Enterprise

409
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,360
later after the
away team returns.

410
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,650
Correlated, right?

411
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,540
Negatively, but correlated.

412
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,790
So the question
is, suppose, e.g.,

413
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,880
suppose we know that
an electron is white.

414
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,990

415
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,215
Does that determine
the hardness?

416
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:10,760

417
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,043
So we can answer this
question by using our boxes.

418
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:16,334
So here's what I'm going to do.

419
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:19,030
I'm going to take some
random set of electrons.

420
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,790
That's not random.

421
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,069
Random.

422
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,814
And I'm going to send
them in to a color box.

423
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,480
And I'm going to take
the electrons that

424
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,740
come out the white aperture.

425
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,850
And here's a useful fact.

426
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,016
When I say random, here's
operationally what I mean.

427
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,580
I take some piece of
material, I scrape it,

428
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,330
I pull off some electrons,
and they're totally

429
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,789
randomly chosen
from the material.

430
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:38,580
And I send them in.

431
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,180
If I send a random pile of
electrons into a color box,

432
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,436
useful thing to know, they
come out about half and half.

433
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:45,810
It's just some
random assortment.

434
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,200
Some of them are white,
some of them come out black.

435
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
Suppose I send some random
collection of electrons

436
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,880
into a color box.

437
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,007
And I take those which come
out the white aperture.

438
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,090
And I want to know, does
white determine hardness.

439
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,140
So I can do that, check, by then
sending these white electrons

440
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,990
into a hardness box and
seeing what comes out.

441
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,100

442
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,690
Hard, soft.

443
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,860
And what we find is that 50%
of those electrons incident

444
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:26,060
on the hardness box come out
hard, and 50% come out soft.

445
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,600
OK?

446
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,850
And ditto if we reverse this.

447
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,560
If we take hardness, and take,
for example, a soft electron

448
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,265
and send it into a color
box, we again get 50-50.

449
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:45,067

450
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,900
So if you take a white
electron, you send it

451
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,232
into a hardness box,
you're at even odds,

452
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,690
you're at chance
as to whether it's

453
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,050
going to come out hard or soft.

454
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,340
And similarly, if you
send a soft electron

455
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,310
into a color box,
even odds it's going

456
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,190
to come out black or white.

457
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,980
So knowing the hardness
does not give you

458
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,570
any information about the
color, and knowing the color

459
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,220
does not give you any
information about the hardness.

460
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,000
cool?

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,910
These are independent facts,
independent properties.

462
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,590
They're not correlated
in this sense,

463
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,950
in precisely this
operational sense.

464
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,100
Cool?

465
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,135
Questions?

466
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:20,635
OK.

467
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:24,280

468
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,720
So measuring the color
give zero predictive power

469
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,553
for the hardness, and
measuring the hardness

470
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:31,280
gives zero predictive
power for the color.

471
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,120

472
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,080
And from that, I will
say that these properties

473
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,662
are correlated.

474
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:45,800
So H, hardness, and color are
in this sense uncorrelated.

475
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:55,130

476
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,237
So using these properties of
the color and hardness boxes,

477
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:00,820
I want to run a few
more experiment's.

478
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,069
I want to probe these
properties of color and hardness

479
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,310
a little more.

480
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,350
And in particular,
knowing these results

481
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,110
allows us to make predictions,
to predict the results

482
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,550
for set a very
simple experiments.

483
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,508
Now, what we're going to
do for the next bit is

484
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,111
we're going to run some
simple experiments.

485
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,610
And we're going to
make predictions.

486
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,110
And then those
simple experiments

487
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,549
are going to lead us to more
complicated experiments.

488
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,590
But let's make sure we
understand the simple ones

489
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,090
first.

490
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,580

491
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,980
So for example, let's take
this last experiment, color

492
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,750
and hardness, and
let's add a color box.

493
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,090
One more monkey.

494
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,360
So color in, and
we take those that

495
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,550
come out the white aperture.

496
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,670
And we send them
into a hardness box.

497
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,095
Hard, soft.

498
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,470
And we take those
electrons which

499
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,260
come out the soft aperture.

500
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,830
And now let's send these
again into a color box.

501
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,220
So it's easy to see
what to predict.

502
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,420
Black, white.

503
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,814

504
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:04,980
So you can imagine a monkey
inside this, going, aha.

505
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,830

506
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,450
You look at it, you
inspect, it comes out white.

507
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,670
Here you look at it and
inspect, it comes out soft.

508
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,260
And you send it
into the color box,

509
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,480
and what do you
expect to happen?

510
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,310
Well, let's think
about the logic here.

511
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,880
Anything reaching
the hardness box

512
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,851
must have been
measured to be white.

513
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,600
And we just did the
experiment that if you

514
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,350
send a white electron
into a hardness box,

515
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,680
50% of the time it comes
out a hard aperture and 50%

516
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,910
of the time it comes
out the soft aperture.

517
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,770
So now we take that
50% of electrons

518
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,019
that comes out the soft
aperture, which had previously

519
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,280
been observed to
be white and soft.

520
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,655
And then we send them into a
color box, and what happens?

521
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,990

522
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,976
Well, since colors
are repeatable,

523
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,600
the natural expectation is that,
of course, it comes out white.

524
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,550
So our prediction,
our natural prediction

525
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,970
here is that of those electrons
that are incident on this color

526
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:09,920
box, 100% should come out white,
and 0% should come out black.

527
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,620

528
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,340
That seem like a reasonable--
let's just make sure

529
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,467
that we're all agreeing.

530
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,050
So let's vote.

531
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,008
How many people think
this is probably correct?

532
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,130

533
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,630
OK, good.

534
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,300
How many people think
this probably wrong?

535
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,800
OK, good.

536
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,480
That's reassuring.

537
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,330
Except you're all wrong.

538
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,310
Right?

539
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,900
In fact, what happens is
half of these electrons exit

540
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,060
white, 50%.

541
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,920
And 50% percent exit black.

542
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,600

543
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,350
So let's think about
what's going on here.

544
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,725
This is really
kind of troubling.

545
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:50,450
We've said already
that knowing the color

546
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,990
doesn't predict the hardness.

547
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,250
And yet, this electron,
which was previously

548
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,770
measured to be white, now when
subsequently measured sometimes

549
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,240
it comes out white,
sometimes it comes out

550
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,450
black, 50-50% of the time.

551
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,510
So that's surprising.

552
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,760
What that tells you is you
can't think of the electron

553
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,630
as a little ball that has black
and soft written on it, right?

554
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,216
You can't, because apparently
that black and soft

555
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:15,840
isn't a persistent
thing, although it's

556
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,714
persistent in the sense
that once it's black,

557
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:19,650
it stays black.

558
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,090
So what's going on here?

559
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,310
Now, I should emphasize
that the same thing happens

560
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:30,570
if I had changed this to
taking the black electrons

561
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,570
and throwing in a hardness and
picking soft and then measuring

562
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,865
the color, or if I had
used the hard electrons.

563
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,740
Any of those combinations,
any of these ports

564
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,448
would have given the
same results, 50-50.

565
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:43,190
Is not persistent in this sense.

566
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,910
Apparently the presence
of the hardness box

567
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,910
tampers with the color somehow.

568
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,390
So it's not quite as trivial is
that hyper intelligent monkey.

569
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,480
Something else is going on here.

570
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,110
So this is suspicious.

571
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,750
So here's the
first natural move.

572
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,120
The first natural move
is, oh, look, surely

573
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,070
there's some additional
property of the electron

574
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,830
that we just
haven't measured yet

575
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,530
that determines whether it
comes out the second color

576
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,520
box black or white.

577
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,520
There's got be some property
that determines this.

578
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,990
And so people have spent
a tremendous amount

579
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,930
of time and energy looking
at these initial electrons

580
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,040
and looking with great
care to see whether there's

581
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,480
any sort of feature of
these incident electrons

582
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,960
which determines which
port they come out of.

583
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,170
And the shocker is no one's
ever found such a property.

584
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,760
No one has ever found
a property which

585
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,820
determines which
port it comes out of.

586
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,815
As far as we can tell,
it is completely random.

587
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,750

588
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,219
Those that flip and
those that don't are

589
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,510
indistinguishable at beginning.

590
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,730
And let me just emphasize, if
anyone found such a-- it's not

591
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,980
like we're not looking, right?

592
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,850
If anyone found such a
property, fame, notoriety,

593
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,000
subverting quantum
mechanics, Nobel Prize.

594
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,930
People have looked.

595
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,360
And there is none that
anyone's been able to find.

596
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,830
And as we'll see later on,
using Bell's inequality,

597
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,800
we can more or less nail
that such things don't exist,

598
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,134
such a fact doesn't exist.

599
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,050
But this tells us something
really disturbing.

600
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,770
This tells us, and this
is the first real shocker,

601
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:20,030
that there is something
intrinsically unpredictable,

602
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,190
non-deterministic, and random
about physical processes

603
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,100
that we observe in a laboratory.

604
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,300
There's no way to determine
a priori whether it

605
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,900
will come out black or
white from the second box.

606
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,160
Probability in this
experiment, it's

607
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,080
forced upon us by observations.

608
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,190

609
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,010
OK, well, there's another
way to come at this.

610
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,430
You could say, look, you ran
this experiment, that's fine.

611
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,050
But look, I've met the
guy who built these boxes,

612
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,200
and look, he's just
some guy, right?

613
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,080
And he just didn't
do a very good job.

614
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,520
The boxes are just badly built.

615
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,270
So here's the way to
defeat that argument.

616
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,990
No, we've built these things
out of different materials,

617
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,310
using different technologies,
using electrons, using

618
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:14,320
neutrons, using bucky-balls,
C60, seriously, it's been done.

619
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,962
We've done this experiment, and
this property does not change.

620
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:19,670
It is persistent.

621
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,240
And the thing that's most
upsetting to me is that not

622
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,890
only do we get the same results
independent of what objects we

623
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,450
use to run the experiment, we
cannot change the probability

624
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,970
away from 50-50 at all.

625
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,920
Within experimental
tolerances, we cannot change,

626
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,990
no matter how we
build the boxes,

627
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,441
we cannot change the
probability by part in 100.

628
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:41,940
50-50.

629
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,880

630
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,400
And to anyone who grew up
with determinism from Newton,

631
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,330
this should hurt.

632
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,580
This should feel wrong.

633
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,460
But it's a property
of the real world.

634
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,084
And our job is going
to be to deal with it.

635
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,500
Rather, your job is going to
be to deal with it, because I

636
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,583
went through this already.

637
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:06,940

638
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,790
So here's a curious
consequence-- oh,

639
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,910
any questions before I cruise?

640
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,470
OK.

641
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,630
So here's a curious consequence
of this series of experiments.

642
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,550
Here's something you can't do.

643
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,050
Are you guys old enough for you
can't do this on television?

644
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,830

645
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,270
This is so sad.

646
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:28,000
OK, so here's
something you can't do.

647
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,680
We cannot build, it is
impossible to build,

648
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,717
a reliable color
and hardness box.

649
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,800
We've built a box that
tells you what color it is.

650
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,405
We've built a box that tells
you what hardness it is.

651
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:42,850
But you cannot build a
meaningful box that tells you

652
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,720
what color and hardness
an electron is.

653
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,410
So in particular, what
would this magical box be?

654
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,700
It would have four ports.

655
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,840
And its ports would say,
well, one is white and hard,

656
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,330
and one is white and soft,
one is black and hard,

657
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,410
and one is black and soft.

658
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,310
So you can imagine
how you might try

659
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,610
to build a color
and hardness box.

660
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,430
So for example, here's
something you might imagine.

661
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,510
Take your incident
electrons, and first

662
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,060
send them into a color box.

663
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,460
And take those white
electrons, and send them

664
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,780
into a hardness box.

665
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
And take those
electrons, and this

666
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,090
is going to be white
and hard, and this

667
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,740
is going to be white and soft.

668
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,610
And similarly, send
these black electrons

669
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,780
into the hardness box,
and here's hard and black,

670
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,340
and here's soft and back.

671
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,514

672
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:46,580
Everybody cool with that?

673
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,267
So this seems to do
the thing I wanted.

674
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,100
It measures both the
hardness and the color.

675
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,003
What's the problem with it?

676
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:53,878
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

677
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:56,716

678
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,030
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah, exactly.

679
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,020
So the color is not persistent.

680
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,750
So you tell me this is a soft
and black electron, right?

681
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,120
That's what you told me.

682
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,100
Here's the box.

683
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,160
But if I put a color
box here, that's

684
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,250
the experiment we just ran.

685
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,120
And what happens?

686
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,290
Does this come out black?

687
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,440
No, this is a crappy
source of black electrons.

688
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,570
It's 50/50 black and white.

689
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,706
So this box can't be built.

690
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,580
And the reason, and I
want to emphasize this,

691
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,970
the reason we cannot
build this box is not

692
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,130
because our
experiments are crude.

693
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,590
And it's not because
I can't build things,

694
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,190
although that's true.

695
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,590
I was banned from a lab one
day after joining it, actually.

696
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,310
So I really can't build,
but other people can.

697
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,230
And that's not why.

698
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,490
We can't because of something
much more fundamental,

699
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,610
something deeper,
something in principle,

700
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,170
which is encoded in
this awesome experiment.

701
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,580
This can be done.

702
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,030
It does not mean anything,
as a consequence.

703
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,900
It does not mean anything
to say this electron is

704
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,376
white and hard, because if you
tell me it's white and hard,

705
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:06,500
and I measure the white,
well, I know if it's hard,

706
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,130
it's going to come out 50-50.

707
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,490
It does not mean anything.

708
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,310
So this is an important idea.

709
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,670
This is an idea which
is enshrined in physics

710
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,420
with a term which
comes with capital

711
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,510
letters, the
Uncertainty Principle.

712
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,620
And the Uncertainty Principle
says basically that, look,

713
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,430
there's some observable,
measurable properties

714
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,160
of a system which
are incompatible

715
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,240
with each other in
precisely this way,

716
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,000
incompatible with each
other in the sense

717
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,170
not that you can't know, because
you can't know whether it's

718
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,450
hard and soft
simultaneously, deeper.

719
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,690
It is not hard and
white simultaneously.

720
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,600
It cannot be.

721
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,580
It does not mean
anything to say it

722
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,770
is hard and white
simultaneously.

723
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,270
That is uncertainty.

724
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,290
And again,
uncertainty is an idea

725
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,290
we're going to come back to
over and over in the class.

726
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,790
But every time you
think about it,

727
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,870
this should be the
first place you

728
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,680
start for the next few weeks.

729
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,680

730
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,700
Yeah.

731
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,190
Questions.

732
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,241
No questions?

733
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:16,740
OK.

734
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,520
So at this point,
it's really tempting

735
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,325
to think yeah, OK, this
is just about the hardness

736
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:25,450
and the color of electrons.

737
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,290

738
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,620
It's just a weird
thing about electrons.

739
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,800
It's not a weird thing
about the rest of the world.

740
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,090
The rest of the world's
completely reasonable.

741
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,850
And no, that's absolutely wrong.

742
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,640
Every object in the world
has the same properties.

743
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,430
If you take bucky-balls,
and you send them

744
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,180
through the analogous
experiment--

745
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,340
and I will show you the
data, I think tomorrow,

746
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,030
but soon, I will
show you the data.

747
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,530
When you take
bucky-balls and run it

748
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,980
through a similar experiment,
you get the same effect.

749
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,870
Now, bucky-balls are huge,
right, 60 carbon atoms.

750
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,700
But, OK, OK, at
that point, you're

751
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,430
saying, dude, come on,
huge, 60 carbon atoms.

752
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,240
So there is a
pendulum, depending

753
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,870
on how you define building, in
this building, a pendulum which

754
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,950
is used, in principle which
is used to improve detectors

755
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,970
to detect gravitational waves.

756
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,930
There's a pendulum with a,
I think it's 20 kilo mirror.

757
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,570

758
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:27,380
And that pendulum exhibits
the same sort of effects here.

759
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,482
We can see these quantum
mechanical effects

760
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:30,190
in those mirrors.

761
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,260
And this is in breathtakingly
awesome experiments

762
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,930
done by Nergis Malvalvala, whose
name I can never pronounce,

763
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,230
but who is totally awesome.

764
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,015
She's an amazing physicist.

765
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:42,390
And she can get these kind of
quantum effects out of a 20

766
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,720
kilo mirror.

767
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,260
So before you say something
silly, like, oh, it's

768
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,400
just electrons, it's
20 kilo mirrors.

769
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,760
And if I could put you on
a pendulum that accurate,

770
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,014
it would be you.

771
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,210
OK?

772
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,800
These are properties of
everything around you.

773
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,860
The miracle is not that
electrons behave oddly.

774
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,190
The miracle is that when you
take 10 to the 27 electrons,

775
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,570
they behave like cheese.

776
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,050
That's the miracle.

777
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,040
This is the underlying
correct thing.

778
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,200

779
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,490
OK, so this is so far so good.

780
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,210
But let's go deeper.

781
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,110
Let's push it.

782
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,080
And to push it, I
want to design for you

783
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,960
a slightly more elaborate
apparatus, a slightly more

784
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,290
elaborate experimental
apparatus.

785
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,600
And for this, I want you to
consider the following device.

786
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,490
I'm going to need to introduce a
couple of new features for you.

787
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,910
Here's a hardness box.

788
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,740
And it has an in port.

789
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,250
And the hardness box
has a hard aperture,

790
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,601
and it has a soft aperture.

791
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:45,350
And now, in addition
to this hardness box,

792
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,850
I'm going to introduce
two elements.

793
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,675
First, mirrors.

794
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,800
And what these mirrors do
is they take the incident

795
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,880
electrons and,
nothing else, they

796
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,715
change the direction of motion,
change the direction of motion.

797
00:33:57,715 --> 00:33:59,590
And here's what I mean
by doing nothing else.

798
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,250
If I take one of these
mirrors, and I take,

799
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,565
for example, a color box.

800
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:05,440
And I take the white
electrons that come out,

801
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,270
and I bounce it off
the mirror, and then

802
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,469
I send these into
a color box, then

803
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,270
they come out white
100% of the time.

804
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,699
It does not change
the observable color.

805
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,199
Cool?

806
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,639
All it does is
change the direction.

807
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,960
Similarly, with
the hardness box,

808
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,251
it doesn't change the hardness.

809
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,780
It just changes the
direction of motion.

810
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,340
And every experiment we've
ever done on these, guys,

811
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,860
changes in no way
whatsoever the color

812
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,540
or the hardness by
subsequent measurement.

813
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,370
Cool?

814
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,860
Just changes the
direction of motion.

815
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,110
And then I'm going to
add another mirror.

816
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,310
It's actually a slightly
fancy set of mirrors.

817
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,989
All they do is they join
these beams together

818
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,001
into a single beam.

819
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,689

820
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,580
And again, this doesn't
change the color.

821
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,920
You send in a white
electron, you get out,

822
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,909
and you measure the
color on the other side,

823
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,530
you get a white electron.

824
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,830
You send in a black
electron from here,

825
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,413
and you measure the color, you
get a black electron again out.

826
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:02,137
Cool?

827
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:03,095
So here's my apparatus.

828
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:05,509

829
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,300
And I'm going to put
this inside a big box.

830
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,890

831
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,417
And I want to run
some experiments

832
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,250
with this apparatus.

833
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:22,040

834
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,030
Everyone cool with
the basic design?

835
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,820
Any questions
before I cruise on?

836
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,144

837
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:30,810
This part's fun.

838
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,724

839
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,140
So what I want to
do now is I want

840
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,440
to run some simple experiments
before we get to fancy stuff.

841
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,090
And the simple experiments
are just going to warm you up.

842
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,590
They're going to
prepare you to make

843
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,430
some predictions and
some calculations.

844
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,900
And eventually we'd like
to lead back to this guy.

845
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,690
So the first
experiment, I'm going

846
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,870
to send in white electrons.

847
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,406
Whoops.

848
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:56,540
Im.

849
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,320
I'm going to send
in white electrons.

850
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,620
And I'm going to
measure at the end,

851
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,870
and in particular at the
output, the hardness.

852
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:15,439

853
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,105
So I'm going to send
in white electrons.

854
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:23,367

855
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:24,950
And I'm going to
measure the hardness.

856
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,501
So this is my apparatus.

857
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm going to measure the
hardness at the output.

858
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,370
And what I mean by
measure the hardness

859
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,780
is I throw these electrons
into a hardness box

860
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,720
and see what comes out.

861
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,932
So this is experiment 1.

862
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,890
And let me draw this, let
me biggen the diagram.

863
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:49,110
So you send white into-- so the
mechanism is a hardness box.

864
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:58,070
Mirror, mirror,
mirrors, and now we're

865
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,520
measuring the hardness out.

866
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,840

867
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,950
And the question I want to ask
is how many electrons come out

868
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,020
the hard aperture, and how
many electrons come out

869
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,130
the soft aperture of
this final hardness box.

870
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,220
So I'd like to know what
fraction come out hard,

871
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,730
and what fraction come out soft.

872
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,246
I send an initial
white electron,

873
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:25,620
for example I took a color
box and took the white output,

874
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,770
send them into the hardness
box, mirror, mirror,

875
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,710
hard, hard, soft.

876
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,030
And what fraction come out
hard, and what fraction

877
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,680
come out soft.

878
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,370

879
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,893
So just think about
it for a minute.

880
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:44,530

881
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,990
And when you have a prediction
in your head, raise your hand.

882
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:56,630

883
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,897
All right, good.

884
00:37:57,897 --> 00:37:59,230
Walk me through your prediction.

885
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,820

886
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,390
AUDIENCE: I think
it should be 50-50.

887
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,980
ALLAN ADAMS: 50-50.

888
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,296
How come?

889
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:10,248
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
color doesn't

890
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:13,626
have any bearing on hardness.

891
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,126
[INAUDIBLE]

892
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:20,600

893
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,520
ALLAN ADAMS: Awesome.

894
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,170
So let me say that again.

895
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,530
So we've done the experiment,
you send a white electron

896
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,946
into the hardness
box, and we know

897
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:27,930
that it's non-predictive, 50-50.

898
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,905
So if you take a white
electron and you send it

899
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:33,879
into the hardness
box, 50% of the time

900
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,170
it will come out the hard
aperture, and 50% of the time

901
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,750
it will come out
the soft aperture.

902
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,727
Now if you take the one that
comes out the hard aperture,

903
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,560
then you send it up
here or send it up here,

904
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,930
we know that these
mirrors do nothing

905
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,720
to the hardness of
the electron except

906
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,062
change the direction of motion.

907
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:49,520
We've already done
that experiment.

908
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,540
So you measure the hardness at
the output, what do you get?

909
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,050
Hard, because it came out hard,
mirror, mirror, hardness, hard.

910
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,060
But it only came out
hard 50% of the time

911
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,270
because we sent in
initially white electron.

912
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,870
Yeah?

913
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,911
What about the other 50%?

914
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:04,680
Well, the other 50% of the time,
it comes out the soft aperture

915
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,212
and follows what I'll
call the soft path

916
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,849
to the mirror, mirror, hardness.

917
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,515
And with soft, mirror,
mirror, hardness,

918
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,097
you know it comes out soft.

919
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:13,680
50% of the time it
comes out this way,

920
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,525
and then it will come out hard.

921
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:17,290
50% it follows the soft path,
and then it will come out soft.

922
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,810
Was this the logic?

923
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,130
Good.

924
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,870
How many people agree with this?

925
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,490
Solid.

926
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,810
How many people disagree?

927
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,630
No abstention.

928
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,280
OK.

929
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,120
So here's a prediction.

930
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,840
Oh, yep.

931
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,220
AUDIENCE: Just a question.

932
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,600
Could you justify
that prediction

933
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,412
without talking about oh,
well, half the electrons were

934
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:47,000
initially measured to be
hard, and half were initially

935
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,860
measured to be soft,
by just saying, well,

936
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,120
we have a hardness box, and
then we joined these electrons

937
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,045
together again, so we don't
know anything about it.

938
00:39:57,045 --> 00:40:00,171
So it's just like
sending white electrons

939
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:01,802
into one hardness
box instead of two.

940
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:04,010
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah, that's
a really tempting argument,

941
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,690
isn't it?

942
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,292
So let's see.

943
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:06,750
We're going to see
in a few minutes

944
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,400
whether that kind of an
argument is reliable or not.

945
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,390
But so far we've been given two
different arguments that lead

946
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,760
to the same prediction, 50-50.

947
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,981
Yeah?

948
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:16,480
Question.

949
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,415

950
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,140
AUDIENCE: Are the electrons
interacting between themselves?

951
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,933
Like when you get
them to where--

952
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,642
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah.

953
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:28,850
This is a very good question.

954
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,900
So here's a question look you're
sending a bunch of electrons

955
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,520
into this apparatus.

956
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,814
But if I take--
look, I took 802.

957
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:37,230
You take two
electrons and you put

958
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,770
them close to each
other, what do they do?

959
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,290
Pyewww.

960
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:39,630
Right?

961
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,140
They interact with each other
through a potential, right?

962
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,320
So yeah, we're being a
little bold here, throwing

963
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,080
a bunch of electrons
in and saying,

964
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,270
oh, they're independent.

965
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,650
So I'm going to do one better.

966
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,670
I will send them
in one at a time.

967
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,950
One electron through
the apparatus.

968
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,140
And then I will
wait for six weeks.

969
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,440
[LAUGHTER]

970
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,280
See, you guys laugh,
you think that's funny.

971
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,250
But there's a famous
story about a guy

972
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,190
who did a similar experiment
with photons, French guy.

973
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,440
And, I mean, the French,
they know what they're doing.

974
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,720
So he wanted to do the same
experiment with photons.

975
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,560
But the problem is
if you take a laser

976
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,220
and you shined it
into your apparatus,

977
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,190
there there are like, 10
to the 18 photons in there

978
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,050
at any given moment.

979
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,633
And the photons, who knows what
they're doing with each other,

980
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,460
right?

981
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,925
So I want to send in one
photon, but the problem

982
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:28,580
is, it's very hard to get
a single photon, very hard.

983
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,851
So what he did, I kid you not,
he took an opaque barrier,

984
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:34,100
I don't remember what it
was, it was some sort of film

985
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,620
on top of glass, I think it
was some sort of oil-tar film.

986
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,390
Barton, do you
remember what he used?

987
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,650
So he takes a film, and it
has this opaque property,

988
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,850
such that the photons that are
incident upon it get absorbed.

989
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,720
Once in a blue moon
a photon manages

990
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
to make its way through.

991
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,820
Literally, like once
every couple of days,

992
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,070
or a couple of hours, I think.

993
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,280
So it's going to
take a long time

994
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,900
to get any sort of statistics.

995
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,580
But he this advantage, that
once every couple of hours

996
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,690
or whatever a photon
makes its way through.

997
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,273
That means inside
the apparatus, if it

998
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:12,280
takes a pico-second to
cross, triumph, right?

999
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,780
That's the week I
was talking about.

1000
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,850
So he does this experiment.

1001
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,600
But as you can tell, you start
the experiment, you press go,

1002
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,510
and then you wait
for six months.

1003
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,890
Side note on this guy, liked
boats, really liked yachts.

1004
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,254
So he had six months
to wait before doing

1005
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:31,170
a beautiful experiment
and having the results.

1006
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,650
So what did he do?

1007
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,380
Went on a world
tour in his yacht.

1008
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,990
Comes back, collects the
data, and declares victory,

1009
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,350
because indeed, he saw
the effect he wanted.

1010
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,515
So I was not kidding.

1011
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:44,650

1012
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,390
We really do wait.

1013
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,730
So I will take your challenge.

1014
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:53,500
And single electron,
throw it in,

1015
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,050
let it go through the
apparatus, takes mere moments.

1016
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,110
Wait for a week, send
in another electron.

1017
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,950
No electrons are
interacting with each other.

1018
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,317
Just a single electron at a time
going through this apparatus.

1019
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:08,025
Other complaints?

1020
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:11,076

1021
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:12,579
AUDIENCE: More stories?

1022
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:13,370
ALLAN ADAMS: Sorry?

1023
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,328
AUDIENCE: More stories?

1024
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,092
ALLAN ADAMS: Oh,
you'll get them.

1025
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:17,300
I have a hard time resisting.

1026
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,870
So here's a prediction, 50-50.

1027
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,570
We now have two
arguments for this.

1028
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,880
So again, let's vote
after the second argument.

1029
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,710
50-50, how many people?

1030
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,960
You sure?

1031
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,669
Positive?

1032
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:32,960
How many people don't think so?

1033
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,670

1034
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,330
Very small dust.

1035
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:37,830
OK.

1036
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,950
It's correct.

1037
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,150
Yea.

1038
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,700
So, good.

1039
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,710

1040
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,100
I like messing with you guys.

1041
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,346
So remember, we're going to
go through a few experiments

1042
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:54,720
first where it's
going to be very

1043
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,810
easy to predict the results.

1044
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,510
We've got four experiments
like this to do.

1045
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,890
And then we'll go on to
the interesting examples.

1046
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,900
But we need to go through
them so we know what happens,

1047
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,149
so we can make an empirical
argument rather than an in

1048
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:03,941
principle argument.

1049
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,273
So there's the first experiment.

1050
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:07,020
Now, I want to run
the second experiment.

1051
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,970

1052
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,480
And the second experiment,
same as the first,

1053
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,200
a little bit louder,
a little bit worse.

1054
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,770
Sorry.

1055
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,960
The second experiment,
we're going

1056
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,590
to send in hard
electrons, and we're

1057
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,900
going to measure color at out.

1058
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,300

1059
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,930
So again, let's look
at the apparatus.

1060
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,560
We send in hard electrons.

1061
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,060
And our apparatus
is hardness box

1062
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,705
with a hard and a soft aperture.

1063
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:47,729

1064
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:50,020
And now we're going to measure
the color at the output.

1065
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,390

1066
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,500
Color, what have I been doing?

1067
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,984

1068
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:01,150
And now I want to know what
fraction come out black,

1069
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,525
and what fraction
come out white.

1070
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:07,130

1071
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,270
We're using lots of
monkeys in this process.

1072
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,880
OK, so this is not
rocket science.

1073
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,030

1074
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,620
Rocket science isn't
that complicated.

1075
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,786
Neuroscience is much harder.

1076
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:20,540
This is not neuroscience.

1077
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,710
So let's figure
out what this is.

1078
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:24,380
Predictions.

1079
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,921
So again, think
about your prediction

1080
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:27,870
your head, come to
a conclusion, raise

1081
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,203
your hand when you have an idea.

1082
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:31,591

1083
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,340
And just because you
don't raise your hand

1084
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,841
doesn't mean I
won't call on you.

1085
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:47,267

1086
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:48,600
AUDIENCE: 50-50 black and white.

1087
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,780
ALLAN ADAMS: 50-50
black and white.

1088
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,365
I like it.

1089
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:51,662
Tell me why.

1090
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:53,703
AUDIENCE: It's gone through
a hardness box, which

1091
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:56,270
scrambled the color, and
therefore has to be [INAUDIBLE]

1092
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:56,570
ALLAN ADAMS: Great.

1093
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,111
So the statement, I'm going to
say that slightly more slowly.

1094
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:01,630
That was an excellent argument.

1095
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,630
We have a hard electron.

1096
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,097
We know that hardness
boxes are persistent.

1097
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:07,180
If you send a hard electron
in, it comes out hard.

1098
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,860
So every electron incident
upon our apparatus

1099
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,880
will transit across
the hard trajectory.

1100
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,090
It will bounce, it will
bounce, but it is still hard,

1101
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,310
because we've already
done that experiment.

1102
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,710
The mirrors do nothing
to the hardness.

1103
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,460
So we send a hard electron
into the color box,

1104
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,030
and what comes out?

1105
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,613
Well, we've done
that experiment, too.

1106
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,255
Hard into color, 50-50.

1107
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,640
So the prediction is 50-50.

1108
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,500
This is your prediction.

1109
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,490
Is that correct?

1110
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,090
Awesome.

1111
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,140
OK, let us vote.

1112
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,520
How many people think
this is correct?

1113
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,570
Gusto, I like it.

1114
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,810
How many people think it's not?

1115
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,540
All right.

1116
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,217
Yay, this is correct.

1117
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:47,050
Third experiment,
slightly more complicated.

1118
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,410

1119
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,200
But we have to go through
these to get to the good stuff,

1120
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,220
so humor me for a moment.

1121
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:02,880
Third, let's send
in white electrons,

1122
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:10,630
and then measure the
color at the output port.

1123
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,640
So now we send in white
electrons, same beast.

1124
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,520
And our apparatus
is a hardness box

1125
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,606
with a hard path
and a soft path.

1126
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:26,736
Do-do-do, mirror,
do-do-do, mirror, box,

1127
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:27,860
join together into our out.

1128
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,720
And now we send those out
electrons into a color box.

1129
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,960

1130
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,120
And our color box,
black and white.

1131
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,140
And now the question is
how many come out black,

1132
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,306
and how many come out white.

1133
00:47:42,306 --> 00:47:44,180

1134
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,310
Again, think through the
logic, follow the electrons,

1135
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,690
come up with a prediction.

1136
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,481
Raise your hand when
you have a prediction.

1137
00:47:51,481 --> 00:48:09,958

1138
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:18,305
AUDIENCE: Well, earlier
we showed that [INAUDIBLE]

1139
00:48:18,305 --> 00:48:20,099
so it'll take those
paths equally--

1140
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,598
ALLAN ADAMS: With
equal probability.

1141
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,098
Good.

1142
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:23,032
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1143
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,795
And then it'll go back
into the color box.

1144
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:26,378
But earlier when we
did the same thing

1145
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:29,246
without the weird path-changing,
it came out 50-50 still.

1146
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:30,372
So I would say still 50-50.

1147
00:48:30,372 --> 00:48:31,162
ALLAN ADAMS: Great.

1148
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:32,860
So let me say that
again, out loud.

1149
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,980
And tell me if
this is an accurate

1150
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,435
extension of what you said.

1151
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:38,810
I'm just going to
use more words.

1152
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,410
But it's, I think,
the same logic.

1153
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,540
We have a white electron,
initially white electron.

1154
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,740
We send it into a hardness box.

1155
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,580
When we send a white
electron into a hardness box,

1156
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,580
we know what happens.

1157
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,372
50% of the time it comes
out hard, the hard aperture,

1158
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:51,330
50% of the time it comes
out the soft aperture.

1159
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,640
Consider those electrons that
came out the hard aperture.

1160
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,030
Those electrons that came
out the hard aperture

1161
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,942
will then transit
across the system,

1162
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:58,900
preserving their hardness
by virtue of the fact

1163
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,000
that these mirrors preserve
hardness, and end up

1164
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,950
at a color box.

1165
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,860
When they end at
the color box, when

1166
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,860
that electron, the single
electron in the system

1167
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,360
ends at this color
box, then we know

1168
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,450
that a hard electron
entering a color box

1169
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,720
comes out black or
white 50% of the time.

1170
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,920
We've done that experiment, too.

1171
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,320
So for those 50% that came
out hard, we get 50/50.

1172
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,739
Now consider the other 50%.

1173
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:21,280
The other half of the time, the
single electron in the system

1174
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,059
will come out the soft aperture.

1175
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:26,350
It will then proceed along
the soft trajectory, bounce,

1176
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,420
bounce, not changing
its hardness,

1177
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,880
and is then a soft electron
incident on the color box.

1178
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,380
But we've also done
that experiment,

1179
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,640
and we get 50-50
out, black and white.

1180
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,470
So those electrons that came
out hard come out 50-50,

1181
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,020
and those electrons that
come out soft come out 50/50.

1182
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,690
And the logic then leads
to 50-50, twice, 50-50.

1183
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,909

1184
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:48,200
Was that an accurate statement?

1185
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:48,980
Good.

1186
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,580
It's a pretty
reasonable extension.

1187
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,590
OK, let's vote.

1188
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,850
How many people
agree with this one?

1189
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,400
OK, and how many
people disagree?

1190
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,110
Yeah, OK.

1191
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,620
So vast majority agree.

1192
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,500
And the answer is
no, this is wrong.

1193
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,620
In fact, all of these, 100% come
out white and 0 come out black.

1194
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,660
Never ever does an electron
come out the black aperture.

1195
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:28,940

1196
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,160
I would like to quote
what a student just

1197
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,720
said, because it's actually the
next line in my notes, which

1198
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,630
is what the hell is going on?

1199
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:42,170

1200
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,340
So let's the series of
follow up experiments

1201
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,790
to tease out what's
going on here.

1202
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,720
So something very
strange, let's just

1203
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,000
all agree, something very
strange just happened.

1204
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,750
We sent a single electron in.

1205
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,970
And that single electron
comes out the hardness box,

1206
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,865
well, it either came
out the hard aperture

1207
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:05,110
or the soft aperture.

1208
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,330
And if it came out the
hard, we know what happens,

1209
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,246
if it came out the soft,
we know what happens.

1210
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:10,930
And it's not 50-50.

1211
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:16,530
So we need to improve
the situation.

1212
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,846
Hold on a sec.

1213
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:18,620
Hold on one sec.

1214
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,192

1215
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:22,572
Well, OK, go ahead.

1216
00:51:22,572 --> 00:51:24,780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's just
a question about the setup.

1217
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,708
So with the second
hardness box, are we

1218
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:30,940
collecting both the
soft and hard outputs?

1219
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,816
ALLAN ADAMS: The second, you
mean the first hardness box?

1220
00:51:33,816 --> 00:51:39,020
AUDIENCE: The one-- are
we getting-- no, the--

1221
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,288
ALLAN ADAMS: Which one, sorry?

1222
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:42,630
This guy?

1223
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,300
Oh, that's a mirror,
not a hardness box.

1224
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,410
Oh, thanks for asking.

1225
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,330
Yeah, sorry.

1226
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,200
I wish I had a better notation
for this, but I don't.

1227
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,910
There's a classic-- well,
I'm not going to go into it.

1228
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,785
Remember that thing
where I can't stop myself

1229
00:51:55,785 --> 00:51:57,840
from telling stories?

1230
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,790
So all this does, it's
just a set of mirrors.

1231
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,956
It's a set of fancy mirrors.

1232
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:03,020
And all it does is it
takes an electron coming

1233
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,530
this way or an electron coming
this way, and both of them

1234
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,988
get sent out in
the same direction.

1235
00:52:06,988 --> 00:52:08,600
It's like a beam joiner, right?

1236
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,240
It's like a y junction.

1237
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,090
That's all it is.

1238
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,050
So if you will, imagine
the box is a box,

1239
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,830
and you take, I don't
know, Professor Zwiebach,

1240
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:17,860
and you put him inside.

1241
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,060
And every time an electron
comes up this way,

1242
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,800
he throws it out that
way, and every time

1243
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,440
it comes in this way, he
throws it out that way.

1244
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,856
And he'd be really ticked at
you for putting him in a box,

1245
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:24,980
but he'd do the job well.

1246
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,480
Yeah.

1247
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,930
AUDIENCE: And this also works if
you go one electron at a time?

1248
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,305
ALLAN ADAMS: This works if
you go one electron at a time,

1249
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:33,190
this works if you go 14
electrons at a time, it works.

1250
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,940
It works reliably.

1251
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,805
Yeah.

1252
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:36,705
AUDIENCE: Just,
maybe [INAUDIBLE]

1253
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:39,019
but what's the difference
between this experiment

1254
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:39,560
and that one?

1255
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,120
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah, I know.

1256
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:41,910
Right?

1257
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,811
Right?

1258
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:45,560
So the question was,
what's the difference

1259
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,137
between this experiment
and the last one.

1260
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:48,970
Yeah, good question.

1261
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,970
So we're going to
have to answer that.

1262
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:50,861
Yeah.

1263
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:54,789
AUDIENCE: Well, you're
mixing again the hardness.

1264
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:58,852
So it's like as you weren't
measuring it at all, right?

1265
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:01,310
ALLAN ADAMS: Apparently it's
a lot we weren't measuring it,

1266
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,810
right?

1267
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,150
Because we send in the white
electron, and at the end

1268
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,870
we get out that
it's still white.

1269
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,640
So somehow this is like
not doing anything.

1270
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,870
But how does that work?

1271
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,330
So that's an
excellent observation.

1272
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,788
And I'm going to build you now
a couple of experiments that

1273
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:18,630
tease out what's going on.

1274
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,500
And you're not going
to like the answer.

1275
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,001
Yeah.

1276
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,583
AUDIENCE: How were
the white electrons

1277
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:23,970
generated in this experiment?

1278
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:24,770
ALLAN ADAMS: The
white electrons were

1279
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,070
generated in the following way.

1280
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,570
I take a random
source of electrons,

1281
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,230
I rub a cat against a balloon
and I charge up the balloon.

1282
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,120
And so I take those
random electrons,

1283
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,520
and I send them
into a color box.

1284
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,275
And we have previously
observed that if you

1285
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:38,200
take random electrons and
throw them into a color box

1286
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,400
and pull out the electrons that
come out the white aperture,

1287
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,730
if you then send
them into a color box

1288
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,020
again, they're still white.

1289
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,000
So that's how I've
generated them.

1290
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,540
I could have done it by
rubbing the cat against glass,

1291
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:53,300
or rubbing it against me,
right, just stroke the cat.

1292
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,510
Any randomly selected
set of electrons

1293
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,760
sent into a color box,
and then from which

1294
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,040
you take the white electrons.

1295
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
AUDIENCE: So how is it different
from the experiment up there?

1296
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,435
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah.

1297
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:02,290
Uh-huh.

1298
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:03,470
Exactly.

1299
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,257
Yeah.

1300
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,590
AUDIENCE: Is the difference
that you never actually know

1301
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:07,790
whether the electron's
hard or soft?

1302
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,581
ALLAN ADAMS: That's a
really good question.

1303
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:12,180
So here's something I'm
going to be very careful not

1304
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,890
to say in this class
to the degree possible.

1305
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:17,270
I'm not going to use
the word to know.

1306
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,895
AUDIENCE: Well, to
measure. [INAUDIBLE]

1307
00:54:18,895 --> 00:54:19,644
ALLAN ADAMS: Good.

1308
00:54:19,644 --> 00:54:21,290
Measure is a very
slippery word, too.

1309
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,320
I've used it here
because I couldn't really

1310
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,880
get away with not using it.

1311
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
But we'll talk about
that in some detail

1312
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,990
later on in the course.

1313
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,448
For the moment, I
want to emphasize

1314
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:34,410
that it's tempting but dangerous
at this point to talk about

1315
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,070
whether you know or don't
know, or whether someone knows

1316
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,736
or doesn't know, for
example, the monkey

1317
00:54:38,736 --> 00:54:40,250
inside knows or doesn't know.

1318
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,170
So let's try to
avoid that, and focus

1319
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,837
on just operational questions of
what are the things that go in,

1320
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:46,836
what are the things that
come out, and with what

1321
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:47,630
probabilities.

1322
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,600
And the reason
that's so useful is

1323
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,890
that it's something
that you can just do.

1324
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,640
There's no ambiguity
about whether you've

1325
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,590
caught a white electron
in a particular spot.

1326
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,374
Now in particular,
the reason these boxes

1327
00:54:57,374 --> 00:55:00,040
are such a powerful tool is that
you don't measure the electron,

1328
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,748
you measure the position
of the electron.

1329
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:03,990
You get hit by the
electron or you don't.

1330
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,590
And by using these boxes we
can infer from their position

1331
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,690
the color or the hardness.

1332
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,270
And that's the reason
these boxes are so useful.

1333
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,064
So we're inferring from
the position, which

1334
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,480
is easy to measure,
you get beaned

1335
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,130
or you don't, we're
inferring the property

1336
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,300
that we're interested in.

1337
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,800
It's a really good
question, though.

1338
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,230
Keep it in the
back of your mind.

1339
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,188
And we'll talk about it
on and off for the rest

1340
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,810
of the semester.

1341
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:27,649
Yeah.

1342
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:29,690
AUDIENCE: So what happens
if you have this setup,

1343
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,510
and you just take away
the bottom right mirror?

1344
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,760
ALLAN ADAMS: Perfect question.

1345
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,385
This leads me into
the next experiment.

1346
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:36,516
So here's the modification.

1347
00:55:36,516 --> 00:55:38,140
But thank you, that's
a great question.

1348
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,950
Here's the modification
of this experiment.

1349
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:44,574
So let's rig up a
small-- hold on,

1350
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,740
I want to go through the
next series of experiments,

1351
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,830
and then I'll come
back to questions.

1352
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,080
And these are great questions.

1353
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,360
So I want to rig up a small
movable wall, a small movable

1354
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:53,910
barrier.

1355
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,050
And here's what this
movable barrier will do.

1356
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,710

1357
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:07,234
If I put the barrier in, so
this would be in the soft path,

1358
00:56:07,234 --> 00:56:08,900
when I put the barrier
in the soft path,

1359
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,590
it absorbs all electrons
incident upon it

1360
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,400
and impedes them
from proceeding.

1361
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,520
So you put a barrier in here,
put a barrier in the soft path,

1362
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,930
no electrons continue through.

1363
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,110
An electron incident
cannot continue through.

1364
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,042
When I say that the
barrier is out, what I mean

1365
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,000
is it's not in the way.

1366
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,740
I've moved it out of the way.

1367
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,160
Cool?

1368
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,450
So I want to run
the same experiment.

1369
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:38,740
And I want to run this
experiment using the barriers

1370
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,785
to tease out how the electrons
transit through our apparatus.

1371
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:47,280

1372
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,940
So experiment four.

1373
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,340

1374
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,520
Let's send in a
white electron again.

1375
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,850
I want to do the same
experiment we just did.

1376
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:06,900
And color at out, but now with
the wall in the soft path.

1377
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,350
Wall in soft.

1378
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,500
So that's this experiment.

1379
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,670
So we send in white
electrons, and at the output

1380
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:25,550
we measure the color as before.

1381
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:33,185
And the question is what
fraction come out black,

1382
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:34,560
and what fraction
come out white.

1383
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,029

1384
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:42,070
So again, everyone think
through it for a second.

1385
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:42,861
Just take a second.

1386
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:44,759

1387
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,050
And this one's a little sneaky.

1388
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:50,267
So feel free to discuss it with
the person sitting next to you.

1389
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:53,760
[CHATTER]

1390
00:57:53,760 --> 00:59:00,782

1391
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:01,740
ALLAN ADAMS: All right.

1392
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,380

1393
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,880
All right, now that everyone
has had a quick second

1394
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,680
to think through
this one, let me just

1395
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,945
talk through what I'd
expect from the point

1396
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:11,820
of these experiments.

1397
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,950
And then we'll talk about
whether this is reasonable.

1398
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,871
So the first thing I
expect is that, look,

1399
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,620
if I send in a white
electron and I put it

1400
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,994
into a hardness pass, I know
that 50% of the time it goes

1401
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:22,980
out hard, and 50% of the
time it goes out soft.

1402
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,870
If it goes out
the soft aperture,

1403
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,966
it's going to get eaten
by the barrier, right?

1404
00:59:27,966 --> 00:59:29,590
It's going to get
eaten by the barrier.

1405
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,730
So first thing I predict
is that the output

1406
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,210
should be down by 50%.

1407
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,170

1408
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,390
However, here's an
important bit of physics.

1409
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,015
And this comes to
the idea of locality.

1410
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:44,110

1411
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,080
I didn't tell you
this, but these

1412
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:52,860
armlinks in the experiment I
did, 3,000 kilometers long.

1413
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,000
3,000 kilometers long.

1414
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,380
That's too minor.

1415
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,350
10 million kilometers long.

1416
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,970
Really long.

1417
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:01,470
Very long.

1418
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:04,190

1419
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,464
Now, imagine an
electron that enters

1420
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:07,880
this, an initially
white electron.

1421
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,090
If we had the barriers out,
if the barrier was out,

1422
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,015
what do we get?

1423
01:00:12,015 --> 01:00:14,690

1424
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,600
100% white, right?

1425
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,640
We just did this
experiment, to our surprise.

1426
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,630
So if we did this, we get 100%.

1427
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,030
And that means an
electron, any electron,

1428
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,780
going along the soft
path comes out white.

1429
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,430
Any electron going along the
hard path goes out white.

1430
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,270
They all come out white.

1431
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,550
So now, imagine I do this.

1432
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,140
Imagine we put a barrier in
here 2 million miles away

1433
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,020
from this path.

1434
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,844
How does a hard
electron along this path

1435
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:39,260
know that I put
the barrier there?

1436
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,710
And I'm going to make it
even more sneaky for you.

1437
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,500
I'm going to insert the
barrier along the path

1438
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,060
after I launched the
electron into the apparatus.

1439
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:53,470
And when I send in the electron,
I will not know at that moment,

1440
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,520
nor will the electron
know, because, you

1441
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,070
know, they're not very
smart, whether the barrier is

1442
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:58,810
in place.

1443
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:02,330
And this is going to be millions
of miles away from this guy.

1444
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,150
So an electron out
here can't know.

1445
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,220
It hasn't been there.

1446
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,890
It just hasn't been there.

1447
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:08,820
It can't know.

1448
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,820
But we know that when
we ran this apparatus

1449
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,575
without the barrier in there,
they came out 100% white.

1450
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:16,700
But it can't possibly know
whether the barrier's in

1451
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,460
there or not, right?

1452
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,340
It's over here.

1453
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,320

1454
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,310
So what this tells us is that
we should expect the output

1455
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,950
to be down by 50%.

1456
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:30,980
But all the electrons
that do make

1457
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,319
it through must come
out white, because they

1458
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:35,110
didn't know that there
was a barrier there.

1459
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,694
They didn't go along that path.

1460
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:40,010

1461
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,510
Yeah.

1462
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,259
AUDIENCE: Not trying
to be wise, but why

1463
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:43,860
are you using the word know?

1464
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,035
ALLAN ADAMS: Oh,
sorry, thank you.

1465
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
that was a slip of the tongue.

1466
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,300
I was making fun
of the electron.

1467
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,810
So in that particular
case, I was not

1468
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,510
referring to my
or your knowledge.

1469
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,884
I was referring
to the electron's

1470
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,630
tragically
impoverished knowledge.

1471
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,370

1472
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,178
Yeah.

1473
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:04,568
AUDIENCE: But if they come
out one at a time white,

1474
01:02:04,568 --> 01:02:06,320
then wouldn't we know
then with certainty

1475
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,826
that that electron is
both hard and white,

1476
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,996
which is like a violation?

1477
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,120
ALLAN ADAMS: Well, here's
the more troubling thing.

1478
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,070
Imagine it didn't
come out 100% white.

1479
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,170
Then the electron would
have demonstrably not

1480
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,990
go along the soft path.

1481
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,240
It would have demonstrably
gone through the hard path,

1482
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,115
because that's the only
path available to it.

1483
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:29,520
And yet, it would still have
known that millions of miles

1484
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,860
away, there's a barrier
on a path it didn't take.

1485
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,100
So which one's more
upsetting to you?

1486
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,720

1487
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,870
And personally, I find this one
the less upsetting of the two.

1488
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,370
So the prediction is our
output should down by 50%,

1489
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,952
because a half of
them get eaten.

1490
01:02:44,952 --> 01:02:46,410
But they should
all come out white,

1491
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,868
because those that
didn't get eaten

1492
01:02:47,868 --> 01:02:50,470
can't possibly know that
there was a barrier here,

1493
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,480
millions of miles away.

1494
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,622
So we run this experiment.

1495
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:57,080
And here's the
experimental result.

1496
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,320
In fact, the experimental
result is yes, the output

1497
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,510
is down by 50%.

1498
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:04,340
But no, not 100%
white, 50% white.

1499
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,870

1500
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:08,800
50% white.

1501
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,850

1502
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,310
The barrier, if we put the
barrier in the hardness path.

1503
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,550
If we put the barrier
in the hardness path,

1504
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:20,170
still down by 50%, and
it's at odds, 50-50.

1505
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,050

1506
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,295
How could the electron know?

1507
01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:26,170
I'm making fun of it.

1508
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,095
Yeah.

1509
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,310
AUDIENCE: So I
guess my question is

1510
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,110
before we ask how it
knows that there's

1511
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,310
a block in one of the paths,
how does it know, before,

1512
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,072
over there, that there were
two paths, and combine again?

1513
01:03:37,072 --> 01:03:38,030
ALLAN ADAMS: Excellent.

1514
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:38,630
Exactly.

1515
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,650
So actually, this
problem was there already

1516
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,730
in the experiment we did.

1517
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,480
All we've done here
is tease out something

1518
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,870
that was existing in the
experiment, something

1519
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:45,890
that was disturbing.

1520
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,620
The presence of those
mirrors, and the option

1521
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,320
of taking two paths,
somehow changed

1522
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,370
the way the electron behaved.

1523
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,830
How is that possible?

1524
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,550
And here, we're seeing
that very sharply.

1525
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,140
Thank you for that
excellent observation.

1526
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,420
Yeah.

1527
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,340
AUDIENCE: What if you
replaced the two mirrors

1528
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,660
with color boxes, so that
both color boxes [INAUDIBLE]

1529
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:07,540

1530
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,040
ALLAN ADAMS: Yeah.

1531
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,910
So the question is basically,
let's take this experiment,

1532
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:16,000
and let's make it even more
intricate by, for example,

1533
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,430
replacing these
mirrors by color boxes.

1534
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:20,690
So here's the thing
I want to emphasize.

1535
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,440

1536
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,894
I strongly encourage you to
think through that example.

1537
01:04:25,894 --> 01:04:28,560
And in particular, think through
that example, come to my office

1538
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,600
hours, and ask me about it.

1539
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,950
So that's going to be setting
a different experiment.

1540
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:34,890
And different
experiments are going

1541
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,230
to have different results.

1542
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,340
So we're going to have to
deal with that on a case

1543
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,090
by case basis.

1544
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,994
It's an interesting
example, but it's

1545
01:04:38,994 --> 01:04:41,440
going to take us a bit afar
from where we are right now.

1546
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,870
But after we get to the
punchline from this,

1547
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,620
come to my office hours and
ask me exactly that question.

1548
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,720
Yeah.

1549
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,210
AUDIENCE: So we had a color
box, we put in white electrons

1550
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,470
and we got 50-50, like random.

1551
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,160
How do you know the boxes work?

1552
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,910
ALLAN ADAMS: How do I
know the boxes work?

1553
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,310
These are the same boxes
we used from the beginning.

1554
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,350
We tested them over and over.

1555
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,600
AUDIENCE: How did you first
check that it was working?

1556
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,595
[INAUDIBLE]

1557
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:04,970
ALLAN ADAMS: How
to say-- there's

1558
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,760
no other way to build a box
that does the properties that we

1559
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,260
want, which is that you send
in color and it comes out color

1560
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,207
again, and the mirrors
behave this way.

1561
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:15,290
Any box that does those
first set of things, which

1562
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,870
is what I will call a
color box, does this, too.

1563
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,280
There's no other way to do it.

1564
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,484
I don't mean just because
like, no one's tested--

1565
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,400
AUDIENCE: Because you
can't actually check it,

1566
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,499
you can't actually [INAUDIBLE]
you know which one is white.

1567
01:05:26,499 --> 01:05:27,790
ALLAN ADAMS: Oh, sure, you can.

1568
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,170
You take the electron that
came out of the color box.

1569
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,650
That's what we mean
by saying it's white.

1570
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1571
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,911
ALLAN ADAMS: But
that's what it means

1572
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:34,580
to say the electron is white.

1573
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,820
It's like, how do you know
that my name is Allan?

1574
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,220
You say, Allan, and I go, what?

1575
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:37,590
Right?

1576
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,131
But you're like, look that's
not a test of whether I'm Allan.

1577
01:05:40,131 --> 01:05:41,917
It's like, well,
what is the test?

1578
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:42,750
That's how you test.

1579
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:43,230
What's your name?

1580
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:43,450
I'm Allan.

1581
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,740
Oh, great, that's your name.

1582
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,110
So that's what I mean by white.

1583
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,110
Now you might quibble
that that's a stupid thing

1584
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,070
to call an electron.

1585
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,460
And I grant you that.

1586
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,710
But it is nonetheless a property
that I can empirically engage.

1587
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,932
OK, so I've been told
that I never ask questions

1588
01:05:55,932 --> 01:05:57,140
from the people on the right.

1589
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:57,633
Yeah.

1590
01:05:57,633 --> 01:05:59,716
AUDIENCE: Is it important
whether the experimenter

1591
01:05:59,716 --> 01:06:02,070
knows if the wall
is there or not?

1592
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,140
ALLAN ADAMS: No.

1593
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,930
This experiment has been done
again by some French guys.

1594
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,850
The French, look, dude.

1595
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:12,860
So there's this guy,
Alain Aspect, ahh,

1596
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,719
great experimentalist,
great physicist.

1597
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,510
And he's done lots of
beautiful experiments

1598
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,590
on exactly this topic.

1599
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,500
And send me an email, and
I'll post some example papers

1600
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,640
and reviews by him-- and he's a
great writer-- on the web page.

1601
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,960
So just send me an email
to remind me of that.

1602
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,554
OK, so we're lowish on
time, so let me move on.

1603
01:06:29,554 --> 01:06:30,970
So what I want to
do now is I want

1604
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,720
to take the lesson of this
experiment and the observation

1605
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,390
that was made a minute ago, that
in fact the same problem was

1606
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,604
present when we ran this
experiment and go 100%.

1607
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:39,270
We should have been
freaked out already.

1608
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,353
And I want to think through
what that's telling us

1609
01:06:41,353 --> 01:06:43,580
about the electron,
the single electron,

1610
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,325
as it transits the apparatus.

1611
01:06:45,325 --> 01:06:52,060

1612
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:56,970
The thing is, at this point
we're in real trouble.

1613
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,150
And here's the reason.

1614
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:02,542
Consider a single electron
inside the apparatus.

1615
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:05,000
And I want to think about the
electron inside the apparatus

1616
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,840
while all walls are out.

1617
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,430
So it's this experiment.

1618
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,890
Consider the single electron.

1619
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:15,630
We know, with total confidence,
with complete reliability,

1620
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,552
that every electron
will exit this color box

1621
01:07:17,552 --> 01:07:18,510
out the white aperture.

1622
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,380
We've done this experiment.

1623
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,830
We know it will come out white.

1624
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,330
Yes?

1625
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,922

1626
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:26,321
Here's my question.

1627
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:27,320
Which route did it take?

1628
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:34,580

1629
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,220
AUDIENCE: Spoiler.

1630
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,620
ALLAN ADAMS: Not a spoiler.

1631
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,350
Which route did it take?

1632
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,230
AUDIENCE: Why do
we care what route?

1633
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,938
ALLAN ADAMS: I'm asking
you the question.

1634
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:46,370
That's why you care.

1635
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,750
I'm the professor here.

1636
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,210
What is this?

1637
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,445
Come on.

1638
01:07:51,445 --> 01:07:52,445
Which route did it take?

1639
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:56,220

1640
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,910
OK, let's think through
the possibilities.

1641
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:00,837
Grapple with this
question in your belly.

1642
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:02,420
Let's think through
the possibilities.

1643
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,100
First off, did it take
the hardness path?

1644
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,414
So as it transits through,
the single electron

1645
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:08,830
transiting through
this apparatus,

1646
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,913
did it take the hard path
or did it take the soft?

1647
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:13,800
These are millions of miles
long, millions of miles apart.

1648
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,733
This is not a
ridiculous question.

1649
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:17,649
Did it go millions of
miles in that direction,

1650
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:19,620
or millions of miles
in that direction?

1651
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,630
Did it take the hardness path?

1652
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,688
Ladies and gentlemen, did
it take the hard path?

1653
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:26,271
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1654
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:29,250

1655
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,029
ALLAN ADAMS: Well, we
ran this experiment

1656
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,000
by putting a wall
in the soft path.

1657
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,682
And if we put a wall
in the soft path,

1658
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:37,140
then we know it
took the hard path,

1659
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,540
because no other
electrons come out

1660
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,415
except those that went
through the hard path.

1661
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:40,979
Correct?

1662
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,850
On the other hand, if it
went through the hard path,

1663
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,189
it would come out
50% of the time white

1664
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:48,390
and 50% of the time black.

1665
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:52,069
But in fact, in this apparatus
it comes out always 100% white.

1666
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:55,221
It cannot have
taken the hard path.

1667
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:55,720
No.

1668
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,400

1669
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,388
Did it take the soft path?

1670
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:05,140

1671
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,580
Same argument,
different side, right?

1672
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,220
No.

1673
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,729
Well, this is not looking good.

1674
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:16,550
Well, look, this was suggested.

1675
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:19,260
Maybe it took both.

1676
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,760
Maybe electrons are
sneaky little devils

1677
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,729
that split in two, and part of
it goes one way and part of it

1678
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:27,540
goes the other.

1679
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,729
Maybe it took both paths.

1680
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:30,729
So this is easy.

1681
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:31,609
We can test this one.

1682
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:35,970
And here is how I'm
going to test this one.

1683
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,220
Oh, sorry.

1684
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,000
Actually, I'm not
going to do that yet.

1685
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,404
So we can test this one.

1686
01:09:40,404 --> 01:09:43,029
So if it took both paths, here's
what you should be able to do.

1687
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:46,729
You should be able to put
a detector along each path,

1688
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,464
and you'd be able
to follow, if you've

1689
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:50,029
got half an electron on one
side and half an electron

1690
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:51,609
on the other, or
maybe two electrons,

1691
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:53,569
one on each side and
one on the other.

1692
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,770
So this is the thing
that you'd predict

1693
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,720
if you said it went both.

1694
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
So here's what we'll do.

1695
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,690
We will take detectors.

1696
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,410
We will put one along
the hard path and one

1697
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:00,243
along the soft path.

1698
01:10:00,243 --> 01:10:02,620
We will run the experiment
and then observe

1699
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,349
whether, and ask whether,
we see two electrons,

1700
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:06,890
we see half and
half, what do we see.

1701
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:10,990
The answer is you always,
always see one electron on one

1702
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,140
of the paths.

1703
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,320
You never see half an electron.

1704
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,750
You never see a
squishy electron.

1705
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,950
You see one electron
on one path, period.

1706
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,540
It did not take both.

1707
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:25,720
You never see an electron split
in two, divided, confused.

1708
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,275
No.

1709
01:10:28,275 --> 01:10:30,480
Well, it didn't
take the hard path,

1710
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,730
didn't take the soft
path, it didn't take both.

1711
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,580
There's one option left.

1712
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:36,157
Neither.

1713
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:36,990
Well, I say neither.

1714
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:40,724
But what about neither?

1715
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:41,390
And that's easy.

1716
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:44,870
Let's put a barrier
in both paths.

1717
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,490
And then what happens?

1718
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,740
Nothing comes out.

1719
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,370
So no.

1720
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:55,050

1721
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:58,650
So now, to repeat an
earlier prescient remark

1722
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:01,760
from one of the
students, what the hell?

1723
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,220
So here's the
world we're facing.

1724
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,100
I want you to think about this.

1725
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,020
Take this seriously.

1726
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,930
Here's the world we're facing.

1727
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,846
And when I say, here's
the world we're facing,

1728
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,380
I don't mean just
these experiments.

1729
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,250
I mean the world around you,
20 kilo mirrors, bucky-balls,

1730
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,900
here is what they do.

1731
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,940
When you send them through
an apparatus like this,

1732
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,680
every single object that
goes through this apparatus

1733
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,960
does not take the hard path,
it does not take the soft path,

1734
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,790
it doesn't take both, and
it does not take neither.

1735
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,450
And that pretty much
exhausts the set

1736
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,840
of logical possibilities.

1737
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:40,300
So what are electrons doing when
they're inside the apparatus?

1738
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,250
How do you describe that
electron inside the apparatus?

1739
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,720
You can't say it's
on one path, you

1740
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,040
can't say it's on the
other, it's not on both,

1741
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,040
and it's not on neither.

1742
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,270
What is it doing halfway
through this experiment?

1743
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,967
So if our experiments
are accurate,

1744
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:54,800
and to the best of our
ability to determine,

1745
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:00,890
they are, and if our arguments
are correct, and that's on me,

1746
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,930
then they're doing
something, these electrons

1747
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,300
are doing something we've
just never thought of before,

1748
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,932
something we've never
dreamt of before,

1749
01:12:06,932 --> 01:12:08,390
something for which
we don't really

1750
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,760
have good words in
the English language.

1751
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,710
Apparently, empirically,
electrons have a way of moving,

1752
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:19,970
electrons have a way of being
which is unlike anything

1753
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,130
that we're used
to thinking about.

1754
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,930
And so do molecules.

1755
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,630
And so do bacteria.

1756
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,170
So does chalk.

1757
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:32,390
It's just harder to
detect in those objects.

1758
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,430
So physicists have a name
for this new mode of being.

1759
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:36,683
And we call it superposition.

1760
01:12:36,683 --> 01:12:39,830

1761
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,250
Now, at the moment,
superposition

1762
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,650
is code for I have no
idea what's going on.

1763
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:48,720

1764
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,370
Usage of the word superposition
would go something like this.

1765
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:55,170
An initially white electron
inside this apparatus

1766
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:59,960
with the walls out is
neither hard, nor soft,

1767
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,030
nor both, nor neither.

1768
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:04,950
It is, in fact, in a
superposition of being hard

1769
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:07,930
and of being soft.

1770
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,600
This is why we
can't meaningfully

1771
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,530
say this electron is some
color and some hardness.

1772
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,680
Not because our boxes are crude,
and not because we're ignorant,

1773
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,220
though our boxes are
crude and we are ignorant.

1774
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,240
It's deeper.

1775
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,950
Having a definite color means
not having a definite hardness,

1776
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,850
but rather being in a
superposition of being hard

1777
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:31,550
and being soft.

1778
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:40,300
Every electron exits a hardness
box either hard or soft.

1779
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,630
But not every electron
is hard or soft.

1780
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:48,620
It can also be a superposition
of being hard or being soft.

1781
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,240
The probability
that we subsequently

1782
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,700
measure it to be
hard or soft depends

1783
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:59,430
on precisely what
superposition it is.

1784
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,900
For example, we know
that if an electron is

1785
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:05,730
in the superposition
corresponding to being white

1786
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:08,840
then there are even odds
of it being subsequently

1787
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,960
measured be hard or to be soft.

1788
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,800

1789
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,620
So to build a better
definition of superposition

1790
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,030
than I have no idea
what's going on

1791
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,580
is going to require
a new language.

1792
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,310
And that language is
quantum mechanics.

1793
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:28,630
And the underpinnings
of this language

1794
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,970
are the topic of the course.

1795
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,780
And developing a
better understanding

1796
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:35,050
of this idea of
superposition is what

1797
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:38,330
you have to do over
the next three months.

1798
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:42,380
Now, if all of this
troubles your intuition,

1799
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,800
well, that shouldn't
be too surprising.

1800
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,630
Your intuition was developed
by throwing spears, and running

1801
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:52,910
from tigers, and catching
toast as it jumps out

1802
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:58,070
of the toaster, all of
which involves things so big

1803
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,410
and with so much energy that
quantum effects are negligible.

1804
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,310

1805
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,920
As a friend of
mine likes to say,

1806
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,777
you don't need to know quantum
mechanics to make chicken soup.

1807
01:15:09,777 --> 01:15:11,985
However, when we work in
very different regimes, when

1808
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:15,920
we work with atoms, when we work
with molecules, when we work

1809
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,010
in the regime of very
low energies and very

1810
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:23,870
small objects, your intuition
is just not a reasonable guide.

1811
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:26,320
It's not that the electrons--
and I cannot emphasize this

1812
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,460
strongly enough-- it is not
that the electrons are weird.

1813
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,160
The electrons do
what electrons do.

1814
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,170
This is what they do.

1815
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:37,430
And it violates your
intuition, but it's true.

1816
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:40,100
The thing that's surprising
is that lots of electrons

1817
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,420
behave like this.

1818
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:47,090
Lots of electrons behave
like cheese and chalk.

1819
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,570
And that's the goal
of 804, to step

1820
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,685
beyond your daily experience
and your familiar intuition

1821
01:15:52,685 --> 01:15:57,040
and to develop an intuition
for this idea of superposition.

1822
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,070
And we'll start in
the next lecture.

1823
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:01,740
I'll see you on Thursday.

1824
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:06,040
