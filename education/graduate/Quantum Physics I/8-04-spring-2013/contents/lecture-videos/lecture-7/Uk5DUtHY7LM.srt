00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:23,489

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,030
PROFESSOR: OK, so
I want to start out

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,420
by reviewing a few
things and putting

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,620
some machinery together.

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,560
Unfortunately, this
thing is sort of stuck.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,300
We're going to need a
later, so I don't know.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,700
I'll put it up for now.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,410
So first just a bit of notation.

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,250
This symbol, you
should think of it

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,520
like the dot product,
or the inner product.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,160
It's just saying that
bracket f g is the integral.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,450
It's a number that you get.

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,780
So this is a number that
you get from the function

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,820
f and the function g
by taking f, taking

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,840
its complex conjugate,
multiplying it by g,

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,710
and then integrating
overall positions.

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,490
All right?

26
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,740
So it's a way to get a number.

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,310
And you should think about it
as the analog for functions

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,530
of the dot product for vectors.

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,490
It's a way to get a
number out of two vectors.

30
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,860
And so, for example, with
vectors we could do v dot w,

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,940
and this is some number.

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,712
And it has a nice
property that v dot v,

33
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:23,170
we can think it as v squared,
it's something like a length.

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,480
It's strictly positive,
and it's something

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,760
like the length of a vector.

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,320
Similarly, if I take f and
take its bracket with f,

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,205
this is equal to the
integral dx of f squared,

38
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,580
and in particular, f could be
complex, so f norm squared.

39
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,000
This is strictly non-negative.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,550
It could vanish, but it's
not negative at a point,

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,740
hence the norm squared.

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,990
So this will be zero
if and only if what?

43
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,010
f is 0, f is the
0 function, right.

44
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,852
So the same way that
if you take a vector,

45
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:54,310
and you take its dot product
with itself, take it the norm,

46
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,470
it's 0 if an only
if the vector is 0.

47
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,270
So this beast satisfies a lot
of the properties of a dot

48
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,920
product.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,980
You should think about
it as morally equivalent.

50
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,190
We'll talk about that
in more detail later.

51
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,670
Second, basic postulate
of quantum mechanics,

52
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,972
to every observable is
associated an operator,

53
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,180
and it's an operator acting
on the space of functions

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,340
or on the space
of wave functions.

55
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,249
And to every operator
corresponding

56
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,790
to an observable in
quantum mechanics

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,060
are associated a special
set of functions called

58
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,640
the eigenfunctions, such
that when the operator acts

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
on that function, it gives
you the same function

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
back times a constant.

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,100
What these functions
mean, physically,

62
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,860
is they are the wave functions
describing configurations

63
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,930
with a definite value of the
corresponding observable.

64
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,240
If I'm in an eigenfunction
of position with

65
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,610
eigenvalue x naught, awesome.

66
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,740
Thank you, AV person, thank you.

67
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,742
So if your system is described
by a wave function which

68
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:50,200
is an eigenfunction
of the position

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,470
operator with
eigenvalue x naught,

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,084
that means you can be
confident that the system is

71
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:56,500
in the configuration
corresponding

72
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,111
to having a definite
position x naught.

73
00:02:59,111 --> 00:02:59,610
Right?

74
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,360
It's not a superposition
of different positions.

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,980
It is at x naught.

76
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,567
Similarly, momentum,
momentum has eigenfunctions,

77
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,900
and we know what these guys are.

78
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,300
These are the exponentials,
e to the iKX's.

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,890
They're the eigenfunctions, and
those are the wave functions

80
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,130
describing states with
definite value of the momentum,

81
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,780
of the associated observable.

82
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,640
Energy as an operator, energy is
described by an operator, which

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,340
has eigenfunctions which I'll
call phi sub n, with energy

84
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,910
as E sub n, those
are the eigenvalues.

85
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,920
And if I tell you that your
wave function is the state phi

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,330
sub 2, what that tells
you is that the system has

87
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,540
a definite energy, E
sub 2, corresponding

88
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,883
to that eigenvalue.

89
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:51,166
Cool?

90
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,040
And this is true for
any physical observable.

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,350
But these are sort
of the basic ones

92
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,849
that we'll keep focusing on,
position, momentum, and energy,

93
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,930
for the next while.

94
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,360
Now a nice property about
these eigenfunctions

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,740
is that for different
eigenvalues,

96
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,220
the associated wave functions
are different functions.

97
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,320
And what I mean by
saying they're different

98
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,736
functions is that
they're actually

99
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,540
orthogonal functions in the
sense of this dot product.

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,050
If I have a state
corresponding to be at x 0,

101
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,579
definite position
x 0, that means

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,371
they're in eigenfunction of
position with eigenvalue x 0,

103
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,829
and I have another
that corresponds

104
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,630
to being at x1, an eigenfunction
of the position operator

105
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,240
or the eigenvalue x1, then
these wave functions are

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,920
orthogonal to each other.

107
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,960
And we get 0 if x 0
is not equal to x1.

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,250
Everyone cool with that?

109
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,520
Now, meanwhile not only
are they orthogonal

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,837
but they're normalized
in a particular way.

111
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,670
The inner product gives
me a delta function,

112
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,490
which goes beep once, so that
if I integrate against it

113
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,319
I get a 1.

114
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,360
Same thing with momentum.

115
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,734
And you do this, this you're
checking on the problem set.

116
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,930
I don't remember if it
was last one or this one.

117
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,410
And for the energies,
energy 1, if I

118
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,436
know the system is in state
energy 1, and let's say e sub n

119
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,625
and e sub m, those
are different states

120
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,250
if n and m are not
equal to each other.

121
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,867
And this inner product
is 0 if n and m are not

122
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,450
equal to each other
and 1 if they are.

123
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,220
Their properly normalized.

124
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,240
Everyone cool with that?

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah.

126
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,768
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
that two eigenfunctions

127
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,514
have the same eigenvalue?

128
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,430
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

129
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,650
It is absolutely possible
for two eigenfunctions

130
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,996
to have the same eigenvalue.

131
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:21,120
That is certainly possible.

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

133
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,257
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.

134
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,840
Thank you, this is
a good technicality

135
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,970
that I didn't want to get into,
but I'll go and get into it.

136
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,053
It's a very good question.

137
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,900
So the question is,
is it possible for two

138
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,620
different eigenfunctions to
have the same eigenvalue.

139
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,640
Could there be two states
with the same energy ,

140
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,550
different states, same energy?

141
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,080
Yeah, that's
absolutely possible.

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
And we'll run into that.

143
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,550
And there's nice
physics encoded in it.

144
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,200
But let's think about
what that means.

145
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
The subsequent question is
well, if that's the case,

146
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,910
are they really
still orthogonal?

147
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,450
And here's the crucial thing.

148
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,190
The crucial thing is, let's
say I take one function,

149
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,750
I'll call the function phi 1,
consider the function phi 1.

150
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,330
And let it have energy E1,
so that E acting on phi 1

151
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,020
is equal to E1 phi 1.

152
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,600
And let there be
another function, phi 2,

153
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,810
such that the energy
operator acting on phi 2

154
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,050
is also equal to E1 phi 2.

155
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,700
These are said to be degenerate.

156
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,950
Degenerate doesn't mean you
go out and trash your car,

157
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,510
degenerate that the
energies are the same.

158
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,997
So what does this tell me?

159
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,080
This tells me a cool fact.

160
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,390
If I take a wave function phi,
and I will call this phi star,

161
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,560
in honor of Shri
Kulkarni, so I've

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,770
got this phi star, which is
a linear combination alpha

163
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,270
phi 1 plus beta phi 2,
a linear combination

164
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,700
of them, a superposition
of those two states.

165
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,060
Is this also an
energy eigenfunction?

166
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,630
Yeah, because if I act on phi
star with E, then it's linear,

167
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,960
so E acting on phi star is
E acting on alpha phi 1,

168
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,370
alpha's a constant,
doesn't care.

169
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,090
Phi 1 gives me an E1.

170
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,060
Similarly, E acting on
phi 2 gives me an E1.

171
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,490
So if I act with E
on this guy, this

172
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,229
is equal to, from both of these
I get an overall factor of E1.

173
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,270
So notice that we get the
same vector back, times

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,260
a constant, a common constant.

175
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,237
So when we have
degenerate eigenfunctions,

176
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,320
we can take arbitrary
linear combinations to them,

177
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,700
get another degenerate
eigenfunction.

178
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,522
Cool?

179
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,230
So this is like,
imagine I have a vector,

180
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,460
and I have another vector.

181
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,840
And they share the
property that they're

182
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,240
both eigenfunctions
of some operator.

183
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,948
That means any linear
combination of them

184
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,284
is also, right?

185
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,950
So there's a whole
vector space, there's

186
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,850
a whole space of
possible functions

187
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,704
that all have the
same eigenvalue.

188
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,870
So now you say, well, look,
are these two orthogonal

189
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,360
to each other?

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,640
No.

191
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,820
These two?

192
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,240
No.

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,140
But here's the thing.

194
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,306
If you have a vector space,
if you have a the space,

195
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:48,030
you can always find
orthogonal guys and a basis

196
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,190
for that space, yes?

197
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,470
So while it's not true that
the eigenfunctions are always

198
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,070
orthogonal, it is true--
we will not prove this,

199
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,920
but we will discuss
the proof of it

200
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,770
later by pulling the
mathematician out

201
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,370
of the closet-- the proof will
say that it is possible to find

202
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,620
a set of eigenfunctions which
are orthogonal in precisely

203
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,380
this fashion, even if
there are degeneracies.

204
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,880
OK?

205
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,960
That theorem is called
the spectral theorem.

206
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,724
And we'll discuss it later.

207
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,140
So it is always
possible to do so.

208
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,460
But you must be alert that
there may be degeneracies.

209
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,140
There aren't always
degeneracies.

210
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,040
In fact, degeneracies
are very special.

211
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,840
Why should two numbers
happen to be the same?

212
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Something has to be forcing
them to be the same.

213
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,715
That's going to be an
important theme for us.

214
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:32,966
But it certainly is possible.

215
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:33,549
Good question.

216
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,085
Other questions?

217
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:36,585
Yeah.

218
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:37,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

219
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,314

220
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
using the triangular

221
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,820
brackets-- so there's another
notation for the same thing,

222
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,351
which is f g, but this carries
some slightly different weight.

223
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,600
It mean something slightly--
you'll see this in books,

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,500
and this means something
very similar to this.

225
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,680
But I'm not going to
use this notation.

226
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,010
It's called Dirac notation.

227
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,360
We'll talk about it
later in the semester,

228
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,640
but we're not going to
talk about it just yet.

229
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,490
But when you see
this, effectively it

230
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,565
means the same thing as this.

231
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,260
This is sort of like dialect.

232
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,590
You know, it's like
French and Quebecois.

233
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,290
Other questions?

234
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,190
My wife's Canadian.

235
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,750
Other questions?

236
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,760
OK.

237
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
So given this fact,
given the fact

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,574
that we can
associate observables

239
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:23,210
to operators, operators
come with special functions,

240
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,460
the eigenfunctions, those
eigenfunctions corresponding

241
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,410
to have a definite
value of the observable,

242
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,320
and they're orthonormal.

243
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,940
This tells us,
and this is really

244
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,523
the statement of the
spectral theorem,

245
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:36,340
that any function can be
expanded in a basis of states

246
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,550
with definite values
of some observable.

247
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,200
So for example,
consider position.

248
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
I claim that any
wave function can

249
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,660
be expanded as a
superposition of states

250
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,190
with definite position.

251
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,510
So here's an arbitrary
function, here's

252
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,140
this set of states with definite
position, the delta functions.

253
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,290
And I can write any
function as a superposition

254
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,960
with some coefficients of
states with definite position,

255
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,814
integrating over all
possible positions, x0.

256
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,480
And this is also sort
of trivially true,

257
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,910
because what's this integral?

258
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,650
Well, it's an integral, dx0
over all possible positions

259
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,170
of this delta function.

260
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,090
But we're evaluating
at x, so this is 0

261
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,550
unless x is equal to x0.

262
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,125
So I can just put
in x instead of x0,

263
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,670
and that gives me psi of x.

264
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,760
Sort of tautological We
can do the same thing

265
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,442
for momentum eigenfunctions.

266
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,150
I claim that any
function can be expanded

267
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,340
in a superposition of
momentum eigenfunctions, where

268
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,160
I sum over all possible
values in the momentum

269
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,120
with some weight.

270
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,670
This psi tilde of
K is just telling

271
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,480
me how much amplitude there
is at that wave number.

272
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,120
Cool?

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,660
But this is the Fourier theorem,
it's a Fourier expansion.

274
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,864
So purely mathematically,
we know that this is true.

275
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:42,530
But there's also the
physical statement.

276
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,404
Any state can be expressed
as a superposition

277
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:47,950
of states with
definite momentum.

278
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,300
There's a math in here, but
there's also physics in it.

279
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,370
Finally, this is less obvious
from a mathematical point

280
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,036
of view, because I
haven't even told you

281
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,560
what energy is, any wave
function can be expanded

282
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
in states with definite energy.

283
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,110
So this is a state, my state
En, with definite energy,

284
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,200
with some coefficient summed
over all possible values

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,790
of the energy.

286
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,750
Given any physical observable,
any physical observable,

287
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,860
momentum, position,
angular momentum,

288
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,790
whatever, given any
physical observable,

289
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,250
a given wave function can be
expanded as some superposition

290
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,920
of having definite
values of that.

291
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,950
Will it in general have definite
values of the observable?

292
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,500
Well a general state be
an energy eigenfunction?

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
No.

294
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,210
But any state is a superposition
of energy eigenfunctions.

295
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,240
Will a random state
have definite position?

296
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,870
Certainly not.

297
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,010
You could have
this wave function.

298
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,110
Superposition.

299
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,210
Yeah.

300
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,710
AUDIENCE: Why is the
energy special such

301
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,680
that you can make an arbitrary
state with a countable number

302
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,954
of energy eigenfunctions
rather than having

303
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:58,120
to do a continuous spectrum?

304
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,890
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

305
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,340
So I'm going to phrase
that slightly differently.

306
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,280
It's an excellent
question, and we'll

307
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,460
come to that at the
end of today's lecture.

308
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,960
So the question is,
those are integrals,

309
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,115
that is a sum over
discrete things.

310
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:08,615
Why?

311
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:12,012
Why is the possible values
of the position continuous,

312
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:14,470
possible values of momentum
continuous, and possible values

313
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,690
of energy discrete?

314
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,050
The answer to this
will become apparent

315
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,152
over the course of your
next few problem sets.

316
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,610
You have to do some
problems to get

317
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,190
your fingers dirty to
really understand this.

318
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,648
But here's the
statement, and we'll

319
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:30,700
see the first version of this
at the end of today's lecture.

320
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,420
Sometimes the allowed energies
of a system, the energy

321
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,240
eigenvalues, are discrete.

322
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,170
Sometimes they are continuous.

323
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,056
They will be discrete when you
have bound states, states that

324
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,930
are trapped in some
region and aren't allowed

325
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,410
to get arbitrarily far away.

326
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,380
They'll be continuous
when you have

327
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,720
states that can get
arbitrarily far away.

328
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,090
Sometimes the momentum will be
allowed to be discrete values,

329
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,930
sometimes it will be allowed
to be continuous values.

330
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,416
And we'll see exactly
why subsequently.

331
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,790
But the thing I
want to emphasize

332
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,720
is that I'm writing this to
emphasize that it's possible

333
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,920
that each of these can be
discrete or continuous.

334
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,120
The important thing is that once
you pick your physical system,

335
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,572
you ask what are the allowed
values of position, what

336
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,030
are the allowed
values of momentum,

337
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,940
and what are the allowed
values of energy.

338
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,290
And then you sum over
all possible values.

339
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,450
Now, in the examples we looked
at yesterday, or last lecture,

340
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,070
the energy could
have been discrete,

341
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,070
as in the case of
the infinite well,

342
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,680
or continuous, as in the
case of the free particle.

343
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,180
In the case of a
continuous particle

344
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,810
this would have
been an integral.

345
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,890
In the case of the system
such as a free particle, where

346
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,890
the energy could take any
of a continuous number

347
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,424
of possible values, this would
be a continuous integral.

348
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,840
To deal with that,
I'm often going

349
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,660
to use the notation, just
shorthand, integral sum.

350
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,500
Which I know is a
horrible bastardization

351
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,120
of all that's good and
just, but on the other hand,

352
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,000
emphasizes the fact
that in some systems

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
you will get continuous,
in some systems discrete,

354
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,520
and sometimes you'll have
both continuous and discrete.

355
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,380
For example, in
hydrogen, in hydrogen

356
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,310
we'll find that there
are bound states

357
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,830
where the electron is stuck
to the hydrogen nucleus,

358
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,920
to the proton.

359
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,510
And there are discrete
allowed energy levels

360
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,170
for that configuration.

361
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,640
However, once you
ionize the hydrogen,

362
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,290
the electron can add
any energy you want.

363
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,170
It's no longer bound.

364
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,090
It can just get
arbitrarily far away.

365
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,360
And there are an
uncountable infinity,

366
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,744
a continuous set
of possible states.

367
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:24,410
So in that situation,
we'll find that we

368
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,230
have both the discrete
and continuous series

369
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,582
of possible states.

370
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:29,082
Yeah.

371
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:29,957
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

372
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,420

373
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure,
if you work on a lattice.

374
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,870
So for example, consider the
following quantum system.

375
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,550
I have an undergraduate.

376
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,760
And that undergraduate has
been placed in 1 of 12 boxes.

377
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,450
OK?

378
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,309
Now, what's the state
of the undergraduate?

379
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:44,850
I don't know.

380
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,410
Is it a definite position state?

381
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,290
It might be.

382
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,660
But probably it's a
superposition, an arbitrary

383
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,360
superposition, right?

384
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,912
Very impressive
undergraduates at MIT.

385
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,745
OK, other questions.

386
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:58,355

387
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,491
Yeah.

388
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,990
AUDIENCE: Do these
three [INAUDIBLE]

389
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,580
hold even if the probability
changes over time?

390
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,170
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

391
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,090
We'll come back to that.

392
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,631
Very good question,
leading question.

393
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,340
OK, so we have this.

394
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,730
The next thing is that
energy eigenfunctions

395
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,540
satisfy some very
special properties.

396
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,340
And in particular,
energy eigenfunctions

397
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,785
have the property from the
Schrodinger equation i h

398
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:25,640
bar d t on psi of x and
t is equal to the energy

399
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,680
operator acting
on psi of x and t.

400
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,150
This tells us that
if we have psi

401
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:37,000
x 0 time t 0 is equal to phi
n of x, as we saw last time,

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,080
then the wave function,
psi at x at time t

403
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,100
is equal to phi n of x.

404
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,250
And it only changes
by an overall phase,

405
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,510
e to the minus i
En t over h bar.

406
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,760
And this ratio En
upon h bar will often

407
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,130
be written omega n is
equal to En over h bar.

408
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,252
This is just the
Dupre relations.

409
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,340
Everyone cool with that?

410
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,570
So are energy
eigenfunctions-- how to say.

411
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,800
No wave function is more
morally good than another.

412
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,727
But some are
particularly convenient.

413
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:16,560
Energy eigenfunctions
have the nice property

414
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,990
that while they're not
in a definite position

415
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,156
and they don't necessarily
have a definite momentum,

416
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,950
they do evolve over time in
a particularly simple way.

417
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,690
And that and the
superposition principle

418
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,250
allow me to write the following.

419
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:34,400
If I know that this is my wave
function at psi at x at time 0,

420
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,230
so let's say in all these cases,
this is psi of x at time 0,

421
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,590
how does this state
evolve forward in time?

422
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,909

423
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:45,950
It's kind of complicated.

424
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,060
How does this description,
how does psi tilde of k

425
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,715
evolve forward in time?

426
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:51,840
Again, kind of complicated.

427
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,497
But when expressed in terms
of the energy eigenstates,

428
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,330
the answer to how it
evolves forward in time

429
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,460
is very simple, because
I know that this

430
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,440
is a superposition, a
linear combination of states

431
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,600
with definite energy.

432
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,079
States with definite
energy evolve with a phase.

433
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,010
And the Schrodinger
equation is linear,

434
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,700
so solutions of the
Schrodinger equation

435
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,680
evolve to become solutions
of the Schrodinger equation.

436
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,950
So how does this state
evolve forward in time?

437
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,476
It evolves forward with a phase,
e to the minus i omega n t.

438
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:21,560
One for every different
terms in this sum.

439
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,020
Cool?

440
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,089
So we are going to harp
on energy functions,

441
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,300
not because they're more moral,
or more just, or more good,

442
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,040
but because they're more
convenient for solving the time

443
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,680
evolution problem in
quantum mechanics.

444
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,020
So most of today is going
to be about this expansion

445
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,470
and qualitative features
of energy eigenfunctions.

446
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,690
Cool?

447
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,510
OK.

448
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,670
And just to close
that out, I just

449
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,420
want to remind you of
a couple of examples

450
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,022
that we did last time,
just get them on board.

451
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:51,355
So the first is a free particle.

452
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,440

453
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,620
So for free particle, we have
that our wave functions-- well,

454
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,125
actually let me not
write that down.

455
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,000
Actually, let me skip
over the free particle,

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,999
because it's so trivial.

457
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:10,417
Let me just talk about
the infinite well.

458
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,000
So the potential is
infinite out here,

459
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,510
and it's 0 inside the
well, and it goes from 0

460
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,790
to L. This is just my
choice of notation.

461
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,300
And the energy
operator, as usual,

462
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,165
is p squared upon
2m plus u of x.

463
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:27,790
You might say, where
did I derive this,

464
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,000
and the answer is I
didn't derive this.

465
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,030
I just wrote it down.

466
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,690
It's like force in
Newton's equations.

467
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,730
You just declare some
force and you ask,

468
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,190
what system does is model.

469
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,120
So here's my system.

470
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,630
It has what looks like a
classical kind of energy,

471
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,450
except these are all operators.

472
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,120
And the potential here is this
guy, it's 0 between 0 and L,

473
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,730
and it's infinite elsewhere.

474
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,740
And as we saw last
time, the solutions

475
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,480
to the energy
eigenvalue equation

476
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,190
are particularly simple.

477
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,500
Phi sub n of x is
equal to root properly

478
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,620
normalized 2 upon
L sine of Kn x,

479
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,790
where kn is equal to
n plus 1 pi, where

480
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,670
n is an integer upon L.

481
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,070
And these were chosen to
satisfy our boundary conditions,

482
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,403
that the wave function must
vanish here, hence the sine,

483
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:19,690
and K was chosen so that it
turned over and just hit 0

484
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,210
as we got to L. And that gave us
that the allowed energies were

485
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,050
discrete, because the En, which
you can get by just plugging

486
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,200
into the energy
eigenvalue equation,

487
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,860
was equal to h bar squared
Kn squared upon 2m.

488
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,550

489
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,370
So this tells us a nice thing.

490
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,430
First off, in this system,
if I take a particle

491
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,940
and I throw it in here
in some arbitrary state

492
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,070
so that at time t
equals zero the wave

493
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:54,170
function x 0 is equal to
sum over n phi n of x Cn.

494
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,440
OK?

495
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,220
Can I do this?

496
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,845
Can I just pick some
arbitrary function

497
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:01,320
which is a superposition
of energy eigenstates?

498
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,956
Sure, because any function is.

499
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:04,955
Any function can be
described as a superposition

500
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,560
of energy eigenfunctions.

501
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,350
And if I use the
energy eigenfunctions,

502
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,600
it will automatically satisfy
the boundary conditions.

503
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,190
All good things will happen.

504
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,170
So this is perfectly
fine initial condition.

505
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,950
What is the system at time t?

506
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,986

507
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,360
Yeah, we just pick
up the phases.

508
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,100
And what phase is this guy?

509
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,420
It's this, e to the
minus i omega n t.

510
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,900
And when I write
omega n, let me be

511
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,820
more explicit about that,
that's En over h bar.

512
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,340
So that's h bar Kn
squared upon 2m t.

513
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,420

514
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,550
Cool?

515
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,740
So there is our solution for
arbitrary initial conditions

516
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,069
to the infinite square well
problem in quantum mechanics.

517
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,610
And you're going to study this
in some detail on your problem

518
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,950
set.

519
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,920
But just to start with a
little bit of intuition,

520
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,390
let's look at the wave
functions and the probability

521
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,177
distributions for the
lowest lying states.

522
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,760
So for example, let's
look at the wave

523
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,360
function for the ground state,
what I will call psi sub 0.

524
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,959
And this is from 0 to L.
And I put these bars here

525
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,750
not because we're
looking at the potential.

526
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:23,954
I'm going to be plotting the
real part of the wave function.

527
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:26,450
But I put these walls
here just to emphasize

528
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,617
that that's where the walls are,
at x equals 0 and x equals L.

529
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:30,700
So what does it look like?

530
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,100
Well, the first one is
going to sine of Kn x.

531
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,010
n is 0.

532
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,804
Kn is going to be pi upon L.
So that's again just this guy.

533
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,470
Now, what's the
probability distribution

534
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,734
associated with psi 0?

535
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,025
Where do you find the particle?

536
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:47,920

537
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,850
So we know that it's just
the norm squared of this wave

538
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,580
function and the norm
squared is here at 0, it's 0

539
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,040
and it rises
linearly, because sine

540
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,580
is linear for small values.

541
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,980
That makes this
quadratic, and a maximum,

542
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,600
and then quadratic again.

543
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,710
So there's our
probability distribution.

544
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,014
Now, here's a funny thing.

545
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:09,930
Imagine I take a particle,
classical particle,

546
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,607
and I put it in a box.

547
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,690
And you put it in a box,
and you tell it, OK, it's

548
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,390
got some energy.

549
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,210
So classically it's
got some momentum.

550
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,834
So it's sort of
bouncing back and forth

551
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,000
and just bounces off the
arbitrarily hard walls

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,880
and moves around.

553
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
Where are you most likely
to find that particle?

554
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,850

555
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,530
Where does it spend
most of its time?

556
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,052

557
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,010
It spends the same amount
of time at any point.

558
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,410
It's moving at
constant velocity.

559
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,247
It goes boo, boo,
boo, boo, right?

560
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,830
So what's the
probability distribution

561
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,020
for finding it at any
point inside, classically?

562
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,411
Constant.

563
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,660
Classically, the probability
distribution is constant.

564
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,576
You're just as likely
to find it near the wall

565
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,615
as not near the wall.

566
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:53,740
However, quantum mechanically,
for the lowest lying

567
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,090
state that is clearly not true.

568
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,310
You're really likely to
find it near the wall.

569
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,060
What's up with that?

570
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,630
So that's a question that
I want to put in your head

571
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,850
and have you think about.

572
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,309
You're going to see a similar
effect arising over and over.

573
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,891
And we're going to
see at the very end

574
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,460
that that is directly related,
the fact that this goes to 0,

575
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,370
is directly related,
and I'm not kidding,

576
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,940
to the transparency of diamond.

577
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,385

578
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,000
OK, I think it was pretty cool.

579
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720

580
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,470
They're expensive.

581
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,399

582
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:31,940
It's also related
to the transparency

583
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,148
of cubic zirconium, which
I guess is less impressive.

584
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:37,020

585
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,090
So the first state,
again, let's look

586
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,790
at the real part of psi 1,
the first excited state.

587
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,700
Well, this is now a sine
with one extra-- with a 2

588
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,940
here, 2 pi, so it
goes through 0.

589
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,740
So the probability distribution
associated with psi 1,

590
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,774
and I should say write this
as a function of x, looks

591
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,190
like, well, again,
it's quadratic.

592
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,310
But it has a 0
again in the middle.

593
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:07,670
So it's going to look like--
oops, my bad art defeats me.

594
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,580
OK, there we go.

595
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,010
So now it's even worse.

596
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,100
Not only is unlikely
to be out here,

597
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,183
it's also very unlikely
to be found in the middle.

598
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:16,750
In fact, there is 0 probability
you'll find it in the middle.

599
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,700
That's sort of surprising.

600
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,990
But you can quickly
guess what happens

601
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,770
as you go to very high energies.

602
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:30,010
The real part of psi n let's
say 10,000, 10 to the 4,

603
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,610
what is that going to look like?

604
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,620
Well, this had no
0s, this had one 0,

605
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,300
and every time you
increase n by 1,

606
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,570
you're just going to add
one more 0 to the sign.

607
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,570
That's an interesting
and suggestive fact.

608
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,650
So if it's size of
10,000, how many nodes

609
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,411
are there going to be in
the middle of the domain?

610
00:24:45,411 --> 00:24:45,910
10,000.

611
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,690
And the amplitude is
going to be the same.

612
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,220
I'm not to be able to do
this, but you get the idea.

613
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,520
And now if I construct the
probability distribution,

614
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,780
what's the probability
distribution going to be?

615
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:02,030
Probability of the 10,000th
psi sub 10 to the 4 of x.

616
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,830
Well, it's again going
to be strictly positive.

617
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,040
And if you are not able to make
measurements on the scale of L

618
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,340
upon 10,000, but just say like
L over 3, because you have

619
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,331
a thumb and you don't have an
infinitely accurate meter, what

620
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:17,830
do you see?

621
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,384
You see effectively a constant
probability distribution.

622
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,050
And actually, I
shouldn't draw it there.

623
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,834
I should draw it
through the half,

624
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:27,170
because sine squared over
2 averages to one half,

625
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,500
or, sorry, sine squared averages
to one half over many periods.

626
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,660
So what we see is that
the classical probability

627
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,100
distribution constant
does arise when

628
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,590
we look at very
high energy states.

629
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,880
Cool?

630
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,084
But it is manifestly
not a good description.

631
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,250
The classical description
is not a good description.

632
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,070
Your intuition is
crappy at low energies,

633
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,570
near the ground state, where
quantum effects are dominating,

634
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,980
because indeed, classically
there was no minimum energy.

635
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,930
Quantum effects have
to be dominating there.

636
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,780
And here we see that even the
probability distribution's

637
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,542
radically different
than our intuition.

638
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:02,042
Yeah.

639
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

640
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:12,650

641
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,900
PROFESSOR: Keep working on it.

642
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,420
So I want you all to think
about what-- you're not,

643
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,820
I promise you, unless you've
already seen some quantum

644
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,641
mechanics, you're
not going to be

645
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,210
able to answer
this question now.

646
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,010
But I want you to have it as
an uncomfortable little piece

647
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,200
of sand in the
back of your oyster

648
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:38,020
mind-- no offense--
what is causing that 0?

649
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,300
Why are we getting 0?

650
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,575
And I'll give you a hint.

651
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:42,960
In quantum mechanics,
anytime something interesting

652
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,985
happens it's because of
superposition and interference.

653
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,220

654
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,850
All right.

655
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,044
So with all that said, so any
questions now over this story

656
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:56,585
about energy
eigenfunctions expanding

657
00:26:56,585 --> 00:27:01,136
in a basis, et cetera,
before we get moving?

658
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:03,370
No, OK.

659
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,880
In that case, get
out your clickers.

660
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,620
We're going to test
your knowledge.

661
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:17,720

662
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,836
Channel 41, for those of
you who have to adjust it.

663
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:32,380
[CHATTER]

664
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,880
Wow.

665
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,100

666
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
That's kind of worrying.

667
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,980

668
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,480
Aha.

669
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:58,400

670
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,780
OK, ready?

671
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,010
OK, channel 41, and here we go.

672
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:18,300

673
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,789
So go ahead and start now.

674
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:21,830
Sorry, there was a little
technical glitch there.

675
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,640
So psi 1 and psi
2 are eigenstates.

676
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,590
They're non-degenerate, meaning
the energies are different.

677
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,020
Is a superposition psi 1 plus
psi 2 also an eigenstate?

678
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:43,398

679
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:45,580
All right, four more seconds.

680
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,610

681
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,560
All right.

682
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,910
I want everyone to turn
to the person next to you

683
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,050
and discuss this.

684
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,538
You've got about 30 seconds
to discuss, or a minute.

685
00:28:56,538 --> 00:29:39,780
[CHATTER]

686
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,940
All right.

687
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,230
I want everyone, now that you've
got an answer, click again,

688
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,300
put in your current best guess.

689
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,564

690
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:51,230
Oh, wait, sorry.

691
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,180
For some reason I have
to start over again.

692
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,080
OK, now click.

693
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,690

694
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,090
This is the best.

695
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,180
I'm such a convert to clickers,
this is just fantastic.

696
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,750
So you guys went from,
so roughly you all

697
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:20,480
went from about 30, 60,
10, to what are we now?

698
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,990
8, 82, and 10.

699
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,230
So it sounds like you guys
are predicting answer b.

700
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:34,420
And the answer is--
I like the suspense.

701
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,170
There we go.

702
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,150
B, good.

703
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,160
So here's a quick question.

704
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,890

705
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,020
So why?

706
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,910
And the reason why is that if
we have E on psi 1 plus psi 2,

707
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,540
this is equal to E on psi 1 plus
E on psi 2, operator, operator,

708
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,200
operator, but this
is equal to E 1

709
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,380
psi 1 E 2 psi 2, which if
E1 and E2 are not equal,

710
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,070
which is not equal to E
times psi 1 plus psi 2.

711
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,350
Right?

712
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,740
Not equal to E anything
times psi 1 plus psi 2.

713
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,230
And it needs to be, in order
to be an eigenfunction,

714
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,960
an eigenfunction of
the energy operator.

715
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,538
Yeah.

716
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:24,162
AUDIENCE: So I was
thinking about this,

717
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:26,037
if this was kind of a
silly random case where

718
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,140
one of the energies is 0.

719
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,640
Does this only happen if you
have something that's infinite?

720
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

721
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,340
So first off, how do
you measure an energy?

722
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,240

723
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,790
Do you ever measure an energy?

724
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,670
Do you ever measure a voltage,
the actual value of the scalar

725
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,670
potential, the electromagnetic
scalar potential?

726
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,169
No.

727
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,259
You measure a difference.

728
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,550
Do you ever measure the energy?

729
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,296
No, you measure a
difference in energy.

730
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:51,670
So the absolute value of energy
is sort of a silly thing.

731
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,440
But we always talk
about it as if it's not.

732
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,680
We say, that's got energy 14.

733
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,200
It's a little bit suspicious.

734
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,480
So to answer your
question, there's

735
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,290
nothing hallowed
about the number 0,

736
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,282
although we will often
refer to zero energy

737
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:05,490
with a very specific meaning.

738
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,430
What we really mean in
that case is the value

739
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,420
of the potential
energy at infinity.

740
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,220
So when I say energy,
usually what I mean

741
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,790
is relative to the
value at infinity.

742
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,415
So then let me ask
your question again.

743
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:16,510
Your question is it
possible to have energy 0?

744
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,802
Absolutely, and we'll see that.

745
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,093
And it's actually going to
be really interesting what's

746
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,910
true of states with
energy 0 in that sense.

747
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,451
Second part of your
question, though,

748
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,690
is how does energy
being 0 fit into this?

749
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,970
Well, does that save us?

750
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,210
Suppose one of
the energies is 0.

751
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,690
Then that says E on psi
1 plus psi 2 is equal to,

752
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,790
let's say E2 is 0.

753
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,950
Well, that term is gone.

754
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,074
So there's just the one E1.

755
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:38,657
Are we in energy eigenstate?

756
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,240
No, because it's
still not of the form

757
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,290
E times psi 1 plus psi 2.

758
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,740
So it doesn't save us, but
it's an interesting question

759
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,200
for the future.

760
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,290
All right.

761
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,935
Next question, four parts.

762
00:32:50,935 --> 00:33:07,100

763
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,250
So the question says x
and p commute to i h bar.

764
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,470
We've shown this.

765
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,580
Is p x equal to i h
bar, and is ip plus cx

766
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,910
the same as cx plus ip?

767
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:29,920

768
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,740
If you're really unsure you
can ask the person next to you,

769
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,170
but you don't have to.

770
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,290
OK, so this is looking good.

771
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,060
Everyone have an answer in?

772
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,560
No?

773
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,770

774
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:55,310
Five, four, three,
two, one, OK, good.

775
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:03,242
So the answer is C, which most
of you got, but not everyone.

776
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,200
A bunch of you put D. So
let's talk through it.

777
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,639
So remember what the definition
of the commutator is.

778
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,219
x with p by definition
is equal to xp minus px.

779
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,500
If we change the
order here, px is

780
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,630
equal to minus
this, px minus xp.

781
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,620
It's just the definition
of the commutator.

782
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,800
So on the other hand, if you
add things, does 7 plus 6

783
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,940
equal 6 plus 7?

784
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,440
Yeah.

785
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,116
Well, of course 6
times 7 is 7 times 6.

786
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,699
So that's not a
terribly good analogy.

787
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,880

788
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Does the order of addition
of operators matter?

789
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,540
No.

790
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,639
Yeah.

791
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,630
Yeah, exactly.

792
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,130
Exactly.

793
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,130
So it's slightly sneaky.

794
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,840
OK, next question.

795
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,170
OK, this one has five.

796
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,860

797
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,670
f and g are both wave functions.

798
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,090
c is a constant.

799
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:03,150
Then if we take the inner
product c times f with g,

800
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,160
this is equal to what?

801
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:21,000

802
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,240
Three, two, one, OK.

803
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,610
So the answer is-- so this
one definitely discuss.

804
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,778

person next to you.

That works like a champ.

816
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,040
So what's the answer?

817
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,970
Yes, complex conjugation.

Don't screw that one up.

OK, next one.

823
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:40,120
A wave function
has been expressed

824
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,570
as a sum of energy

Here I'm calling them mu rather
than phi, but same thing.

826
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:47,070
Compared to the
original wave function,

that we're using the energy

the same information, or
it can't be determined.

All stationary states, or
all energy eigenstates,

have the form that spatial
and time dependence

842
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,760
is the spatial dependence,
the energy eigenfunction,

843
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,110
times a phase, so that the norm
squared is time independent.

844
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,290
Consider the sum of two

Non-degenerate means they
have different energy.

848
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,140
Is the wave function stationary?

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,840
Is the probability

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,420
independent or is
it time dependent?

00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,950
All right.

877
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,375
Let's vote again.

878
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,980

879
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,720
And hold on, starting now.

880
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,480
OK, vote again.

881
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,063
You've got 10 seconds
to enter a vote.

882
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:24,520

883
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,710
Wow.

884
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,110
OK, two seconds.

885
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,020
Good.

886
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:36,940
So the distribution on
this one went from 30, 50,

887
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:47,290
20 initially, to now
it is 10, 80, and 10.

888
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,030
Amazingly, you guys got worse.

889
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:55,620
The answer is C. And I want
you to discuss with each other

890
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,174
why it's C.

891
00:40:57,174 --> 00:41:27,840
[CHATTER]

892
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,420
All right.

893
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,060
OK.

894
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,830
So let me talk you through it.

895
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,230
So the wave function,
we've said psi of x and t

896
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:45,865
is equal to phi 1 at x, e to
the minus i omega 1 t plus phi

897
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:50,940
2 of x e to the
minus i omega 2 t.

898
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,670
So great, we take
the norm squared.

899
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,342
What's the probability to
find it at x at time t.

900
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:56,800
The probability
density is the norm

901
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,260
squared of this guy,
psi squared, which

902
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,590
is equal to phi 1 complex
conjugate e to the plus i omega

903
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:12,200
1 t plus phi 2 complex conjugate
e to the plus i omega 2t times

904
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,210
the thing itself phi 1
of x e to the minus i

905
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:23,320
omega 1 t plus phi 2 of x e to
the minus i omega 2t, right?

906
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,870
So this has four terms.

907
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,470
The first term is
psi 1 norm squared.

908
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,650
The phases cancel, right?

909
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,340
You're going to see this
happen a billion times in 804.

910
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,850
The first term is going
to be phi 1 norm squared.

911
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,970
There's another term, which
is phi 2 norm squared.

912
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,345
Again the phases exactly
cancel, even the minus i omega 2

913
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:42,080
t to the plus i omega 2 t.

914
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,470
Plus phi 2 squared.

915
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,280
But then there are two cross
terms, the interference terms.

916
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,180
Plus phi 1 complex conjugate
phi 2 e to the i omega 1 t

917
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,670
e to the plus i omega 1 t, i
omega 1 t, and e to the minus

918
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,129
i omega 2t, minus omega 2.

919
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,670
So we have a cross-term
which depends

920
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,270
on the difference
in frequencies.

921
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,394
Frequencies are like energies
[INAUDIBLE] in h bar,

922
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:09,240
so it's a difference
in energies.

923
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,740
And then there's
another term, which

924
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,670
is the complex
conjugate of this guy,

925
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,950
phi 2 star times phi 1 phi
2 complex conjugate phi 1

926
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,825
and the phases are also
the complex conjugate

927
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:28,350
e to the minus i omega 1 minus
omega 2 t of x of x of x of x.

928
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,880
So is there time dependence
in this, in principle?

929
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,890
Absolutely, from the
interference terms.

930
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,500
Were we not in
the superposition,

931
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,470
we would not have
interference terms.

932
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,465
Time dependence comes
from interference,

933
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:41,600
when we expand in
energy eigenfunctions.

934
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,187
Cool?

935
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,270
However, can these vanish?

936
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:44,769
When?

937
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:48,450

938
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,460
Sorry, say again?

939
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,577
Great, so when omega 1
equals omega 2, what happens?

940
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:55,660
Time dependence goes away.

941
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,750
But omega 1 is e 1 over h bar,
omega 2 is e 2 over h bar,

942
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,595
and we started out by saying
these are non-degenerate.

943
00:44:03,595 --> 00:44:05,970
So if they're non-degenerate,
the energies are different,

944
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,361
the frequencies are different,
so that doesn't help us.

945
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:09,860
How do we kill this
time dependence?

946
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,860

947
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,399
Yes.

948
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:15,190
If the two functions
aren't just orthogonal

949
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,150
in a functional sense, but
if we have the following.

950
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,410
Suppose phi 1 is like this.

951
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,430
It's 0 everywhere except for
in some lump that's phi 1,

952
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,230
and phi 2 is 0
everywhere except here.

953
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,670
Then anywhere that phi 1
is non-zero, phi 2 is zero.

954
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,790
And anywhere where phi 2
is non-zero, phi 1 is zero.

955
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,940
So this can point-wise vanish.

956
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,250
Do you expect this to
happen generically?

957
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,850
Does it happen for the
energy eigenfunctions

958
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,270
in the infinite square well?

959
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,710

960
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,360
Sine waves?

961
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,981

962
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:48,480
No.

963
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,100
They have zero at
isolated points,

964
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,019
but they're non-zero
generically.

965
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,310
Yeah, so it doesn't work there.

966
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,875
What about for
the free particle?

967
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,250
Well, those are
just plain waves.

968
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,680
Does that ever happen?

969
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,610
No.

970
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,540
OK, so this is an
incredibly special case.

971
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,040
We'll actually see
it in one problem

972
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,485
on a problem set later on.

973
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,130
It's a very special case.

974
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,935
So technically, the
answer is C. And I

975
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:11,570
want you guys to
keep your minds open

976
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,310
on these sorts of questions,
when does a spatial dependence

977
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,370
matter and when are
there interference terms.

978
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,260
Those are two
different questions,

979
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,718
and I want you to
tease them apart.

980
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,490
OK?

981
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,590
Cool?

982
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,784
Yeah?

983
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:26,462
AUDIENCE: Is a valid
way to think about this

984
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:32,063
to think that you're fixing
the initial [INAUDIBLE]

985
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,594

986
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:36,760
PROFESSOR: That's a very
good way to think about it.

987
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,150
That's exactly right.

988
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,082
That's a very,
very good question.

989
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:43,040
Let me say that subtly
differently, and tell me

990
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,956
if this agrees with what
you were just saying.

991
00:45:44,956 --> 00:45:47,806
So I can look at
this wave function,

992
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,930
and I already know that
the overall phase of a wave

993
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,150
function doesn't matter.

994
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,960
That's what it is to say a
stationary state is stationary.

995
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
It's got an overall phase
that's the only thing,

996
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,540
norm squared it goes away.

997
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:01,950
So I can write this as e to
the minus i omega 1 t times phi

998
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:08,750
1 of x plus phi 2 of x
e to the minus i omega

999
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,506
2 minus omega 1 t.

1000
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:13,920
Is that what you mean?

1001
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,170
So that's one way to do this.

1002
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,503
We could also do something else.

1003
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:22,752
We could do e to the minus i
omega 1 plus omega 2 upon 2 t.

1004
00:46:22,752 --> 00:46:24,210
And this is more,
I think, what you

1005
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,085
were thinking of, a sort
of average frequency

1006
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:28,070
and then a relative
frequency, and then

1007
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,050
the change in the frequencies
on these two terms.

1008
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:31,760
Absolutely.

1009
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,720
So you can organize
this in many, many ways.

1010
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,670
But your question gets at
a very important point,

1011
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,670
which is that the overall
phase doesn't matter.

1012
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,400
But relative phases in a
superposition do matter.

1013
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,727
So when does a phase
matter in a wave function?

1014
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:50,560
It does not matter if
it's an overall phase.

1015
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,170
But it does matter if it's a
relative phase between terms

1016
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,790
in a superposition.

1017
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,870
Cool?

1018
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,510
Very good question.

1019
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,330
Other questions?

1020
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,550
If not, then I have some.

1021
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,930
So, consider a system
which is in the state--

1022
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,549
so I should give you five--
system is in a state which

1023
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:13,090
is a linear combination
of n equals 1

1024
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,280
and n equals 2 eigenstates.

1025
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,956

1026
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,580
What's the probability
that measurement

1027
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,082
will give us energy E1?

1028
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:21,373
And it's in this superposition.

1029
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:28,390

1030
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,215
OK, five seconds.

1031
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:33,780

1032
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,660
OK, fantastic.

1033
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,450
What's the answer?

1034
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,497
Yes, C, great.

1035
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:38,580
OK, everyone got that one.

1036
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,100
So one's a slightly more
interesting question.

1037
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,580

1038
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:55,210
Suppose I have an infinite
well with width L.

1039
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,150
How does the energy,
the ground state energy,

1040
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,175
compare to that of a
system with a wider well?

1041
00:48:01,175 --> 00:48:16,070

1042
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,335
So L versus a larger
L. OK, four seconds.

1043
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:25,140

1044
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,940
OK, quickly discuss amongst
yourselves, like 10 seconds.

1045
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:45,160
[CHATTER]

1046
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,300
All right.

1047
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,185
Now click again.

1048
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:51,493

1049
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:51,993
Yeah.

1050
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:56,080

1051
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,520
All right.

1052
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,260
Five seconds.

1053
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,270
One, two, three,
four, five, great.

1054
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:08,470
OK, the answer is A. OK,
great, because the energy

1055
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,530
of the infinite well
goes like K squared.

1056
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:18,974
K goes like 1 over L. So the
energy is, if we make it wider,

1057
00:49:18,974 --> 00:49:21,140
the energy if we make it
wider is going to be lower.

1058
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,260

1059
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,725
And last couple of questions.

1060
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:31,510

1061
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,900
OK, so t equals 0.

1062
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,350
Could the wave function for an
electron in an infinite square

1063
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,880
well of width a, rather than
L, be A sine squared of pi x

1064
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,680
upon a, where A is suitably
chosen to be normalized?

1065
00:49:48,680 --> 00:50:10,460

1066
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,870
All right, you've got
about five seconds left.

1067
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,550

1068
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,420
And OK, we are at chance.

1069
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,710
We are at even
odds, and the answer

1070
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,380
is not a superposition
of A and B,

1071
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,130
so I encourage you to discuss
with the people around you.

1072
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,567
[CHATTER]

1073
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:51,731

1074
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:52,230
Great.

1075
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,400
What properties had it
better satisfy in order

1076
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,774
to be a viable wave function?

1077
00:50:56,774 --> 00:50:58,440
What properties should
the wave function

1078
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,391
have so that it's reasonable?

1079
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:00,890
Yeah.

1080
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,080
Is it zero at the ends?

1081
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,001
Yeah.

1082
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:03,500
Good.

1083
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,841
Is it smooth?

1084
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:07,100
Yeah.

1085
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,830
Exactly.

1086
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,691
And so you can write
it as a superposition.

1087
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,190
Excellent.

1088
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,692
So the answer is?

1089
00:51:11,692 --> 00:51:12,192
Yeah.

1090
00:51:12,192 --> 00:51:17,516

1091
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:18,015
All right.

1092
00:51:18,015 --> 00:51:20,780

1093
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,750
Vote again.

1094
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,170

1095
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,794
OK, I might have
missed a few people.

1096
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:27,710
So go ahead and start.

1097
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,800

1098
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,185
OK, five more seconds.

1099
00:51:33,185 --> 00:51:37,230

1100
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:37,950
All right.

1101
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:43,820
So we went from 50-50 to 77-23.

1102
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,820
That's pretty good.

1103
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,260
What's the answer?

1104
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:47,890
A. Why?

1105
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:51,710

1106
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,892
Is this an energy eigenstate?

1107
00:51:53,892 --> 00:51:55,160
No.

1108
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,960
Does that matter?

1109
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,620
No.

1110
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,710
What properties had this
wave function better

1111
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:05,460
satisfy to be a reasonable wave
function in this potential?

1112
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,660
Say again?

1113
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,020
It's got to vanish at the walls.

1114
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,853
It's got to satisfy the
boundary conditions.

1115
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:12,290
What else must be true
of this wave function?

1116
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,010
Normalizable.

1117
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,240
Is it normalizable?

1118
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,880
Yeah.

1119
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,400
What else?

1120
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,900
Continuous.

1121
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,524
It better not have
any discontinuities.

1122
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:19,471
Is it continuous?

1123
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:19,970
Great.

1124
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,470
OK.

1125
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,691
Is there any reason that this
is a stupid wave function?

1126
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:24,190
No.

1127
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,500
It's perfectly reasonable.

1128
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,360
It's not an energy
eigenfunction,

1129
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,330
but-- Yeah, cool?

1130
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,150
Yeah.

1131
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,252
AUDIENCE: This is sort
of like a math question.

1132
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,768
So to write that
at a superposition,

1133
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,636
you have to write it like
basically a Fourier sign

1134
00:52:38,636 --> 00:52:39,592
series?

1135
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:42,940
Isn't the [INAUDIBLE]
function even, though?

1136
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,426
PROFESSOR: On this domain,
that and the sines are even.

1137
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:48,925
So this is actually odd, but
we're only looking at it from 0

1138
00:52:48,925 --> 00:52:53,480
to L. So, I mean
that half of it.

1139
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,080
The sines are odd, but we're
only looking at the first peak.

1140
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,780
So you could just
as well have written

1141
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,420
that as cosine of the
midpoint plus the distance

1142
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,595
from the midpoint.

1143
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,470
Actually, let me say
that again, because it's

1144
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,511
a much better question I
just give it shrift for.

1145
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:10,050

1146
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,010
So here's the question.

1147
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,359
The question is, look, so
sine is an odd function,

1148
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,900
but sine squared is
an even function.

1149
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,670
So how can you expand sine
squared, an even function,

1150
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,780
in terms of sines,
an odd function?

1151
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,860
But think about this physically.

1152
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:30,570
Here's sine squared in our
domain, and here's sine.

1153
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,810
Now what do you mean by even?

1154
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,905
Usually by even we mean
reflection around zero.

1155
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:35,780
But I could just as well
have said reflection

1156
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,770
around the origin.

1157
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,030
This potential is symmetric.

1158
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,745
And the energy eigenfunctions
are symmetric about the origin.

1159
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:44,120
They're not symmetric about
reflection around this point.

1160
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,380
But they are symmetric about
reflection around this point.

1161
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,210
That's a particularly
natural place to call it 0.

1162
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,930
So I was calling them sine
because I was calling this 0,

1163
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,304
but I could have
called it cosine

1164
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:55,470
if I called this
0, for the same Kx.

1165
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,570
And indeed, can we
expand this sine

1166
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,440
squared function
in terms of a basis

1167
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,610
of these sines on
the domain 0 to L?

1168
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,030
Absolutely.

1169
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,220
Very good question.

1170
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,355
And lastly, last
clicker question.

1171
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:12,700

1172
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,460
Oops.

1173
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,030
Whatever.

1174
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,210
OK.

1175
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,756
At t equals 0, a
particle is described

1176
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,130
by the wave function
we just saw.

1177
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,461

1178
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,710
Which of the following is
true about the wave function

1179
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,600
at subsequent times?

1180
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:37,650

1181
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,210
5 seconds.

1182
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:42,776

1183
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:43,730
Whew.

1184
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,650
Oh, OK.

1185
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,360
In the last few seconds we had
an explosive burst for A, B,

1186
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,870
and C. So our
current distribution

1187
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,960
is 8, 16, 10, and 67,
sounds like 67 is popular.

1188
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,630
Discuss quickly, very quickly,
with the person next to you.

1189
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,510
[CHATTER]

1190
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:13,670

1191
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,093
OK, and vote again.

1192
00:55:17,093 --> 00:55:21,580

1193
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,980
OK, five seconds.

1194
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,180
Get your last vote in.

1195
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:28,240

1196
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,300
All right.

1197
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:33,472
And the answer is D. Yay.

1198
00:55:33,472 --> 00:55:37,289

1199
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:38,580
So let's think about the logic.

1200
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,950
Let's go through the logic here.

1201
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,360
So as was pointed out by
a student up here earlier,

1202
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,070
the wave function
sine squared of pi x

1203
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,100
can be expanded in terms of
the energy eigenfunction.

1204
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,150
Any reasonable function
can be expanded

1205
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,540
in terms of a superposition
of definite energy

1206
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,600
states of energy eigenfunctions.

1207
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,490
So that means we can
write psi at some time

1208
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:04,060
as a superposition Cn sine of n
pi x upon a e to the minus i e

1209
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:09,450
n t upon h bar, since those are,
in fact, the eigenfunctions.

1210
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,200
So we can do that.

1211
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,877
Now, when we look at
the time evolution,

1212
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:13,710
we know that each term
in that superposition

1213
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,450
evolves with a phase.

1214
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,220
The overall wave function
does not evolve with a phase.

1215
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,360
It is not an energy eigenstate.

1216
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,460
There are going to be
interference terms due

1217
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,207
to the fact that
it's a superposition.

1218
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,540
So its probability distribution
is not time-independent.

1219
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,640
It is a superposition.

1220
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,430
And so the wave function doesn't
rotate by an overall phase.

1221
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:37,030
However, we can solve
the Schrodinger equation,

1222
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,810
as we did before.

1223
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,440
The wave function is
expanded at time 0

1224
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,544
as the energy eigenfunctions
times some set of coefficients.

1225
00:56:43,544 --> 00:56:44,960
And the time
evolution corresponds

1226
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,230
to adding two each independent
term in the superposition

1227
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,120
the appropriate phase for
that energy eigenstate.

1228
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,040
Cool?

1229
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,540
All right.

1230
00:56:54,540 --> 00:57:03,220
So the answer is D. And that's
it for the clicker questions.

1231
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,050
OK, so any questions on the
clicker questions so far?

1232
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,050
OK, those are going to
be posted on the web site

1233
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,190
so you can go over them.

1234
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,250
And now back to
energy eigenfunctions.

1235
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:24,770

1236
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,730
So what I want to talk about
now is the qualitative behavior

1237
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,140
of energy eigenfunctions.

1238
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,460
Suppose I know I have
an energy eigenfunction.

1239
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,955
What can I say generally
about its structure?

1240
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:38,870

1241
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,175
So let me ask the question,
qualitative behavior.

1242
00:57:41,175 --> 00:57:47,270

1243
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,670
So suppose someone hands
you a potential U of x.

1244
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,990
Someone hands you some
potential, U of x,

1245
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,900
and says, look, I've
got this potential.

1246
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,580
Maybe I'll draw it for you.

1247
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,850
It's got some wiggles,
and then a big wiggle,

1248
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,880
and then it's got a
big wiggle, and then--

1249
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,195
do I want to do that?

1250
00:58:03,195 --> 00:58:04,275
Yeah, let's do that.

1251
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:08,089
Then a big wiggle, and
something like this.

1252
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:09,630
And someone shows
you this potential.

1253
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,921
And they say, look, what are
the energy eigenfunctions?

1254
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,770

1255
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,510
Well, OK, free
particle was easy.

1256
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,070
The infinite square
well was easy.

1257
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,207
We could solve
that analytically.

1258
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,290
The next involved solving
a differential equation.

1259
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,360
So what differential equation
is this going to lead us to?

1260
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,570
Well, we know that the
energy eigenvalue equation

1261
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:32,070
is minus h bar
squared upon 2 m phi

1262
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:38,570
prime prime of x plus U of x
phi x, so that's the energy

1263
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,620
operator acting on
phi, is equal to,

1264
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:47,949
saying that it's an energy
eigenfunction, phi sub E,

1265
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,740
says that it's equal
to the energy operator

1266
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,670
acting on this eigenfunction
is just a constant E phi sub

1267
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,870
E of x.

1268
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,680
And I'm going to work
at moment in time,

1269
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,420
so we're going to drop all the
t dependence for the moment.

1270
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,920
So this is the
differential equation

1271
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,072
we need to solve where U of
x is this god-awful function.

1272
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:08,780
Do you think it's very
likely that you're

1273
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,670
going to be able to
solve this analytically?

1274
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,700
Probably not.

1275
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,761
However, some basic
ideas will help

1276
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:21,010
you get an intuition for
what the wave function should

1277
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,240
look like.

1278
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,910
And I cannot overstate the
importance of being able

1279
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,560
to eyeball a system and guess
the qualitative features of its

1280
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,030
wave functions,
because that intuition,

1281
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,590
that ability to estimate, is
going to contain an awful lot

1282
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:35,340
of physics.

1283
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,790
So let's try to extract it.

1284
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,930
So in order to do
so, I want to start

1285
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,945
by massaging this
equation into a form which

1286
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:42,070
is particularly convenient.

1287
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,790

1288
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,910
So in particular, I'm going to
write this equation as phi sub

1289
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,449
E prime prime.

1290
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:51,740
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take this term,

1291
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,615
I'm going to notice this
has two derivatives,

1292
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:56,026
this has no derivatives,
this has no derivatives.

1293
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:59,130
And I'm going to move this
term over here and combine

1294
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,600
these terms into E
minus U of x, and I'm

1295
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,320
going to divide each side by 2m
upon h bar squared with a minus

1296
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,260
sign, giving me that
phi prime prime of E

1297
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:14,420
of x upon phi E of x dividing
through by this phi E

1298
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,250
is equal to minus 2m
over h bar squared.

1299
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,682

1300
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,140
And let's just get
our signs right.

1301
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,560
We've got the minus
from here, so this

1302
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,960
is going to be E minus U of x.

1303
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:33,931

1304
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:35,680
So you might look at
that and think, well,

1305
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,010
why is that any better than
what I've just written down.

1306
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,034
But what is the second
derivative of function?

1307
01:00:43,034 --> 01:00:44,700
It's telling you not
its slope, but it's

1308
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,550
telling you how
the slope changes.

1309
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:49,588
It's telling about the
curvature of the function.

1310
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:52,046
And what this is telling me is
something very, very useful.

1311
01:00:52,046 --> 01:00:54,179

1312
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:55,970
So for example, let's
look at the function.

1313
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,360
Let's assume that
the function is real,

1314
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,901
although we know in
general it's not.

1315
01:00:58,901 --> 01:01:02,100
Let's assume that the function
is real for simplicity.

1316
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,910
So we're going to plot
the real part of phi

1317
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,210
in the vertical axis.

1318
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,630
And this is x.

1319
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:15,130
Suppose the real part of phi
is positive at some point.

1320
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,070
Phi prime prime,
if it's positive,

1321
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:19,297
tells us that not only
is the slope positive,

1322
01:01:19,297 --> 01:01:20,130
but it's increasing.

1323
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:21,600
Or it doesn't tell us
anything about the slope,

1324
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,080
but it tells us that whatever
the slope, it's increasing.

1325
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,650
If it's negative, the slope is
increasing as we increase x.

1326
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,210
If it's positive, it's
increasing as we increase x.

1327
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,450
So it's telling us that the
wave function looks like this,

1328
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,880
locally, something like that.

1329
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,040
If phi is negative,
if phi is negative,

1330
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,254
then if this
quantity is positive,

1331
01:01:41,254 --> 01:01:42,920
then phi prime prime
has to be negative.

1332
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,150
But negative is curving down.

1333
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:50,210

1334
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:54,780
So if this quantity, which
I will call the curvature,

1335
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:01,260
if this quantity is positive,
it curves away from the axis.

1336
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:07,100
So this is phi prime prime
over phi greater than 0.

1337
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,700
If this quantity is
positive, the function

1338
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,050
curves away from the axis.

1339
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,440
Cool?

1340
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,270
If this quantity is negative,
phi prime prime upon

1341
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,490
phi less than 0,
exactly the opposite.

1342
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,920
This has to be negative.

1343
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,480
If phi is positive, then phi
prime prime has to be negative.

1344
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,907
It has to be curving down.

1345
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,710

1346
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,290
And similarly, if
phi is negative,

1347
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:33,170
then phi prime prime
has to be positive,

1348
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,500
and it has to curve up.

1349
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,840
So if this quantity is positive,
if the curvature is positive,

1350
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,440
it curves away from the axis.

1351
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,950
If the curvature is negative,
if this quantity is negative,

1352
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,120
it curves towards the axis.

1353
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,000
So what does that tell
you about solutions

1354
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,206
when the curvature is
positive or negative?

1355
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:50,330
It tells you the following.

1356
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:52,930

1357
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,940
It tells you that, imagine
we have a function where

1358
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,450
phi prime prime over
phi is constant.

1359
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:03,050
And in particular, let's
let phi prime prime over phi

1360
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,760
be a constant,
which is positive.

1361
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,671
And I'll call that positive
constant kappa squared.

1362
01:03:10,671 --> 01:03:12,170
And to emphasize
that it's positive,

1363
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,174
I'm going to call
it kappa squared.

1364
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:15,090
It's a positive thing.

1365
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,980
It's a real number squared.

1366
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,635
What does the
solution look like?

1367
01:03:18,635 --> 01:03:22,510

1368
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,120
Well, this quantity is positive.

1369
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,661
It's always going
to be curving away.

1370
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:28,287
So we have solutions that
look like this or solutions

1371
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:29,120
that look like this.

1372
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,990
Can it ever be 0?

1373
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,907

1374
01:03:32,907 --> 01:03:34,740
Yeah, sure, it could
be an inflection point.

1375
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,698
So for example, here the
curvature is positive,

1376
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:40,170
but at this point the curvature
has to switch to be like this.

1377
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,960
What functions are of this form?

1378
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,752

1379
01:03:44,752 --> 01:03:45,960
Let me give you another hint.

1380
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,550
Here's one.

1381
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,400
Is this curvature positive?

1382
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,057
Yes.

1383
01:03:50,057 --> 01:03:50,890
What about this one?

1384
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,470

1385
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:53,970
Yup.

1386
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,220
Those are all
positive curvature.

1387
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,910
And these are exponentials.

1388
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,930
And the solution to this
differential equation

1389
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:06,670
is e to the plus kappa x
or e to the minus kappa x.

1390
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,940
And an arbitrary
solution of this equation

1391
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,130
is a superposition A e
to the kappa x plus B

1392
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,346
e to the minus kappa x.

1393
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:16,244
Everyone cool with that?

1394
01:04:16,244 --> 01:04:17,660
When this quantity
is positive, we

1395
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,390
get growing and
collapsing exponentials.

1396
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,890

1397
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:22,390
Yeah?

1398
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:25,610

1399
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:29,990
On the other hand, if
phi prime prime over phi

1400
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:34,010
is a negative number, i.e.
minus what I'll call k

1401
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:44,010
squared, then the curvature
has to be negative.

1402
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:47,460
And what functions have
everywhere negative curvature?

1403
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,169
Sinusoidals.

1404
01:04:49,169 --> 01:04:49,669
Cool?

1405
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:53,540

1406
01:04:53,540 --> 01:05:00,445
And the general solution
is A e to the i K x plus B

1407
01:05:00,445 --> 01:05:03,226
e to the minus i K x.

1408
01:05:03,226 --> 01:05:06,710
So that differential equation,
also known as sine and cosine.

1409
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,170

1410
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:09,670
Cool?

1411
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:12,540

1412
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:19,765
So putting that together
with our original function,

1413
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:21,140
let's bring this up.

1414
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,110

1415
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:26,680
So we want to think about
the wave functions here.

1416
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,014
But in order to think about
the energy eigenstates,

1417
01:05:29,014 --> 01:05:30,305
we need to decide on an energy.

1418
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,850

1419
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,794
We need to pick an
energy, because you

1420
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:37,960
can't find the solution
without figuring the energy.

1421
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,950
But notice something nice here.

1422
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,260
So suppose the energy is e.

1423
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,360
And let me just draw
E. This is a constant.

1424
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,187
The energy is this.

1425
01:05:43,187 --> 01:05:45,520
So this is the value of E.
Here we're drawing potential.

1426
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,489
But this is the value of the
energy, which is a constant.

1427
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:49,280
It's just a number.

1428
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,680

1429
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,200
If you had a classical particle
moving in this potential,

1430
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,760
what would happen?

1431
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,650
It would roll around.

1432
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,360
So for example, let's say
you gave it this energy

1433
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,210
by putting it here.

1434
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,168
And think of this as a
gravitational potential.

1435
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,157
You put it here, you let
go, and it falls down.

1436
01:06:06,157 --> 01:06:07,990
And it'll keep rolling
until it gets up here

1437
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,230
to the classical turning point.

1438
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,080
And at that point,
its kinetic energy

1439
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,910
must be 0, because its potential
energy is its total energy,

1440
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,670
at which point it will
turn around and fall back.

1441
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,359
Yes?

1442
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:20,150
If you take your ball,
and you put it here,

1443
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,525
and you let it
roll, does it ever

1444
01:06:21,525 --> 01:06:23,960
get here, to this position?

1445
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,990
No, because it doesn't
have enough energy.

1446
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:29,620
Classically, this is
a forbidden position.

1447
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,790
So given an energy
and given a potential,

1448
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:38,200
we can break the system up
into classically allowed zones

1449
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,760
and classically forbidden zones.

1450
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,170

1451
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,120
Cool?

1452
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,210
Now, in a classically
allowed zone,

1453
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,670
the energy is greater
than the potential.

1454
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,170
And in a classically
forbidden zone,

1455
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,300
the energy is less
than the potential.

1456
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,530

1457
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:03,230
Everyone cool with that?

1458
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:06,080
But this tells us
something really nice.

1459
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,429
If the energy is greater
than the potential,

1460
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:10,970
what do you know
about the curvature?

1461
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:15,050

1462
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:15,550
Yeah.

1463
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,175
If we're in a
classically allowed zone,

1464
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:20,150
so the energy is greater
than the potential,

1465
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,860
then this quantity is positive,
there's a minus sign here,

1466
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,920
so this is negative.

1467
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,760
So the curvature is negative.

1468
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,920

1469
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,680
Remember, curvature
is negative means

1470
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,000
that we curve towards the axis.

1471
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,015
So in a classically
allowed region,

1472
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,640
the wave function
should be sinusoidal.

1473
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,840

1474
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,050
What about in the classically
forbidden regions?

1475
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:47,280
In the classically
forbidden regions,

1476
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,890
the energy is less
than the potential.

1477
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,848
That means in magnitude
this is less than this,

1478
01:07:50,848 --> 01:07:53,270
this is a negative
number, minus sign,

1479
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,110
the curvature is going to
be minus times a minus is

1480
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:59,050
a positive, so the
curvature's positive.

1481
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,260

1482
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,190
So the solutions are
either growing exponentials

1483
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:10,000
or shrinking exponentials
or superpositions of them.

1484
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,810
Everyone cool with that?

1485
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,340
So let's think about
a simple example.

1486
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,452
Let's work through this
in a simple example.

1487
01:08:16,452 --> 01:08:18,575
And let me give you a
little bit more board space.

1488
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:22,430

1489
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,122
Simple example would be a
potential that looks like this.

1490
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:27,580
And let's just
suppose that we want

1491
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:33,760
to find an energy eigenfunction
with energy that's E. Well,

1492
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,250
this is a classically
allowed zone,

1493
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,939
and these are the classically
forbidden regions.

1494
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:43,370
Now I want to ask, what does
the wave function look like?

1495
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,630
And I don't want to draw it
on top of the energy diagram,

1496
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,037
because wave function
is not an energy.

1497
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:50,620
Wave function is a
different quantity,

1498
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,161
because it's got
different axes and I

1499
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,279
want it drawn on
a different plot.

1500
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:58,410
So but as a function
of x-- so just

1501
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:01,185
to get the positions
straight, these

1502
01:09:01,185 --> 01:09:02,560
are the bounds of
the classically

1503
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,899
allowed and forbidden regions.

1504
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,140
What do we expect?

1505
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,830
Well, we expect that it's
going to be sinusoidal in here.

1506
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:13,160

1507
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,450
We expect that it's
going to be exponential

1508
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:20,399
growing or converging
out here, exp.

1509
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,100
But one last important thing is
that not only is the curvature

1510
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,270
negative in here in these
classically allowed regions,

1511
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,080
but the magnitude
of the curvature,

1512
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,870
how rapidly it's turning over,
how big that second derivative

1513
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:35,040
is, depends on the
difference between the energy

1514
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,865
and the potential.

1515
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:38,240
The greater the difference,
the more rapid the curvature,

1516
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,500
the more rapid the turning
over and fluctuation.

1517
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,450
If the differences between the
potential and the true energy,

1518
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:46,720
the total energy, is small, then
the curvature is very small.

1519
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,990
So the derivative
changes very gradually.

1520
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,660
What does that tell us?

1521
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,194
That tells us that in here the
wave function is oscillating

1522
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,110
rapidly, because the
curvature, the difference

1523
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,320
between the energy and
the potential is large,

1524
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,690
and so the wave function
is oscillating rapidly.

1525
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:04,200
As we get out towards the
classical turning points,

1526
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,640
the wave function will be
oscillating less rapidly.

1527
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,865
The slope will be
changing more gradually.

1528
01:10:09,865 --> 01:10:11,810
And as a consequence,
two things happen.

1529
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,768
Let me actually draw this
slightly differently.

1530
01:10:13,768 --> 01:10:17,647

1531
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,230
So as a consequence
two things happen.

1532
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:21,130
One is the wavelength
gets longer,

1533
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,847
because the
curvature is smaller.

1534
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:24,680
And the second is the
amplitude gets larger,

1535
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,280
because it keeps on having
a positive slope for longer

1536
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,520
and longer, and it takes
longer to curve back down.

1537
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,260
So here we have
rapid oscillations.

1538
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:41,430
And then the oscillations get
longer and longer wavelength,

1539
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,892
until we get out to the
classical turning point.

1540
01:10:43,892 --> 01:10:45,225
And at this point, what happens?

1541
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:47,746

1542
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,120
Yeah, it's got to
be [INAUDIBLE].

1543
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,860
Now, here we have some sine,
and some superpositions

1544
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,647
of sine and cosines,
exponentials.

1545
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:55,730
And in particular, it
arrives here with some slope

1546
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,490
and with some value.

1547
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,140
We know this side we've
got to get exponentials.

1548
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,330
And so this sum of sines
and cosines at this point

1549
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:06,400
must match the sum
of exponentials.

1550
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,282
How must it do so?

1551
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:10,490
What must be true of the
wave function at this point?

1552
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,880

1553
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,090
Can it be discontinuous?

1554
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:17,850
Can its derivative
be discontinuous?

1555
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,350
No.

1556
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:21,800
So the value and the
derivative must be continuous.

1557
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,690
So that tells us precisely
which linear combination

1558
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,089
of positive growing and
shrinking exponentials we get.

1559
01:11:29,089 --> 01:11:30,630
So we'll get some
linear combination,

1560
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:32,360
which may do this for awhile.

1561
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,860
But since it's got
some contribution

1562
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:36,490
of positive exponential, it'll
just grow exponentially off

1563
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:37,982
to infinity.

1564
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:39,940
And as the energy gets
further and further away

1565
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,780
from the potential, now in
their negative sine, what

1566
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,444
happens to the rate of growth?

1567
01:11:45,444 --> 01:11:46,610
It gets more and more rapid.

1568
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,540
So this just diverges
more and more rapidly.

1569
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,554
Similarly, out here we
have to match the slope.

1570
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:52,970
And we know that
the curvature has

1571
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,530
to be now positive,
so it has to do this.

1572
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:59,120

1573
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,040
So two questions.

1574
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,820
First off, is this sketch
of the wave function

1575
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,560
a reasonable sketch,
given what we

1576
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,570
know about curvature and this
potential of a wave function

1577
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:09,280
with that energy?

1578
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,007

1579
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:14,840
Are there ways in which
it's a bad estimate?

1580
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,798

1581
01:12:17,798 --> 01:12:19,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1582
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,685
PROFESSOR: OK, excellent.

1583
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,600
AUDIENCE: On the right side,
could it have crossed zero?

1584
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,720
PROFESSOR: Absolutely, it
could have crossed zero.

1585
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,920
So I may have drawn this badly.

1586
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,060
It turned out it
was a little subtle.

1587
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:28,740
It's not obvious.

1588
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,340
Maybe it actually punched
all the way through zero,

1589
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:31,660
and then it diverged
down negative.

1590
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,785
That's absolutely positive.

1591
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:35,075
So that was one of the
quibbles you could have.

1592
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:36,450
Another quibble
you could have is

1593
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,200
that it looks like I have
constant wavelength in here.

1594
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,010
But the potential's
actually changing.

1595
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,070
And what you should
chalk this up to,

1596
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:46,299
if you'll pardon the pun, is
my artistic skills are limited.

1597
01:12:46,299 --> 01:12:48,340
So this is always going
to be sort of inescapable

1598
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,505
when you qualitatively
draw something.

1599
01:12:50,505 --> 01:12:53,130
On a test, I'm not going to bag
you points on things like that.

1600
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,584
That's what I want to emphasize.

1601
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:56,250
But the second thing,
is there something

1602
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,622
bad about this wave function?

1603
01:12:57,622 --> 01:12:58,830
Yes, you've already named it.

1604
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:01,090
What's bad about
this wave function?

1605
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,150
It's badly non-normalizable.

1606
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,820
It diverges off to infinity
out here and out here.

1607
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:10,110
What does that tell you?

1608
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:10,860
It's not physical.

1609
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,170
Good.

1610
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,045
What else does it tell
you about this system?

1611
01:13:13,045 --> 01:13:16,110

1612
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:18,220
Sorry?

1613
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:18,870
Excellent.

1614
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,670
Is this an allowable energy?

1615
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:22,840
No.

1616
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,130
If the wave function
has this energy,

1617
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,700
it is impossible to make
it continuous, assuming

1618
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,530
that I drew it correctly,
and have it converge.

1619
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:33,640
Is this wave function allowable?

1620
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,180
No, because it does not satisfy
our boundary conditions.

1621
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,763
Our boundary conditions are that
the wave function must vanish

1622
01:13:38,763 --> 01:13:41,710
out here and it must
vanish out here at infinity

1623
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,785
in order to be normalizable.

1624
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:44,410
Here we failed.

1625
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,590

1626
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,160
Now, you can imagine
that-- so let's

1627
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,610
decrease the energy
a little bit.

1628
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:53,760
If we decrease the energy,
our trial energy just a little

1629
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,200
tiny bit, what happens?

1630
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,570
Well, that's going to decrease
the curvature in here.

1631
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,260
We decrease, we bring the energy
in just a little tiny bit.

1632
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,550
That means this is a
little bit smaller.

1633
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,130
The potential stays the same.

1634
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,760
So the curvature in
the allowed region

1635
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,010
is just a little
tiny bit smaller.

1636
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:10,600
And meanwhile,
the allowed region

1637
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,649
has got just a
little bit thinner.

1638
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:14,940
And what that will do is the
curvature's a little less,

1639
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:29,406
the region's a little less,
so now we have-- Sorry,

1640
01:14:29,406 --> 01:14:30,885
I get excited.

1641
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:33,010
And if we tweak the energy,
what's going to happen?

1642
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,176
Well, it's going to arrive
here a little bit sooner.

1643
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:38,220

1644
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,490
And let's imagine
something like this.

1645
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:45,250
And if we chose the
energy just right,

1646
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,120
we would get it to match
to a linear combination

1647
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,560
of collapsing and
growing exponentials,

1648
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,585
where the contribution
from the growing

1649
01:14:52,585 --> 01:14:54,210
exponential in this
direction vanishes.

1650
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:57,180

1651
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,430
There's precisely one
value of the energy that

1652
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:01,992
lets me do that with
this number of wiggles.

1653
01:15:01,992 --> 01:15:03,950
And so then it goes
through and does its thing.

1654
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:07,860

1655
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,570
And we need it to
happen on both sides.

1656
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,510
Now if I take that solution,
so that it achieves convergence

1657
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,740
out here, and it achieves
convergence out here,

1658
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:21,940
and I take that energy and I
increase it by epsilon, by just

1659
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,450
the tiniest little bit, what
will happen to this wave

1660
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,057
function?

1661
01:15:26,057 --> 01:15:26,640
It'll diverge.

1662
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,670
It will no longer
be normalizable.

1663
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:31,070
When you have classically
forbidden regions,

1664
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:36,010
are the allowed energies
continuous or discrete?

1665
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,820
And that answers a question
from earlier in the class.

1666
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,570
And it also is going
to be the beginning

1667
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,986
of the answer to
the question, why

1668
01:15:41,986 --> 01:15:44,000
is the spectrum of
hydrogen discrete.

1669
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,960
See you next time.

1670
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:53,316
