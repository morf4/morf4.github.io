9
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:27,307

10
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,265
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

11
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:32,650

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm in a very good mood today.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,260

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,370
It's nothing to do with the
class, but I'm having a baby.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,370
[APPLAUSE]

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,314

17
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,660
PROFESSOR: So that's
kind of exciting.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,500
So if I just started
giggling, you'll know why.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,650
And in six months if I am just
weeping and on the ground,

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,550
you'll also know why.

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,320

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,330
So today we're going
to do two things.

23
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,590
The first is I'm going
to give you-- well,

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,210
the first is review a
little bit of practice

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,180
for the exam we're going
to have on Thursday.

26
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,346
So let me tell you a little
bit more about the exam.

27
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,210
The exam, by the way, has been
rescheduled to be in the 6120,

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,550
not in Walker Gym.

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,190
So it's going to be the usual
place, we're not moving.

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,760
And the reason is I'm changing
the format on this exam,

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,160
in part to make it a little
less of a burden to everyone.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,035
But also in part because
I've been struggling

33
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:33,140
with the question of how to
make the exam most useful.

34
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,160
The purpose of an
exam like this is not

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,470
to get grades for you
guys, although that's

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,910
an incidental byproduct.

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,680
The purpose is to give you
some feedback on how you're

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,180
doing, how your command of
the material has evolved.

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,010
And also to help you
learn some of the things

40
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,820
that you might
not have mastered.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,065
So the way the exam is
going to be structured

42
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,310
is going about 15 minutes
of short answer questions--

43
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,890
a couple of very short
computations but mostly short

44
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,297
answer questions-- on paper.

45
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:02,880
You'll hand those
back, and then we'll

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,340
go over those questions
in class afterwards.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,630
So it's a relatively
low pressure exam

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,799
and it's mostly conceptual.

49
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,340
It will cover everything we've
done through this last problem

50
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,490
set to the degree that we get
to the lecture part of today

51
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,850
after questions.

52
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,460
Today's lecture will
not be directly covered,

53
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,935
however it will be fair game
for the next midterm-- which

54
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,560
will be more of a
traditional midterm--

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,840
and that's coming in April.

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,912
So the structure
of today is, I'm

57
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,120
going to give you a whole
bunch of clicker questions.

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,309
So make sure you've
got your clickers out.

59
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,850
And those clicker
questions are going

60
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,540
to give you a sense for the
level and scope of the exam.

61
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,190
The exam will be a little harder
than the clicker questions,

62
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,420
but not a whole lot.

63
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,920
And the difference
is just that it's

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,199
going to be on paper in front
of you instead of clickered.

65
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,990
And thus, that gives
you a little more room

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,120
to do calculations on a piece
of paper, short calculations.

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,860
And then after that we'll come
on to-- in some sense a review,

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,370
but also an introduction to
the Dirac Bra-Ket notation

69
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,250
that many of our
textbooks use, but that we

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,740
haven't introduced
in lectures so far.

71
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,650
Any questions before
we get started?

72
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,050
AUDIENCE: What channel are we?

73
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,060
PROFESSOR: 41.

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,478
Other questions?

75
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,761
AUDIENCE: So no practice exam?

76
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,510
PROFESSOR: I think
there will probably not

77
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,680
be a practice exam because
of the shift in format.

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,540
Today will basically
be your practice exam.

79
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,550
If I can get my work
together and get

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,280
you guys a practice exam of
the right format, then maybe.

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,240
But it wouldn't be all
that useful is the problem.

82
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,423
So watch what happens today.

83
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,355
AUDIENCE: Will you post
the clicker questions

84
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:48,682
from today and the last
time on the website?

85
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,640
PROFESSOR: I will post
the questions from today

86
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,944
on the website, yes.

87
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:53,735
AUDIENCE: So it's 50
minutes, short answer.

88
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,675
Is there a certain
number of questions

89
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:57,370
that's going to be on it?

90
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,120
PROFESSOR: I'm not
going to tell you that.

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,510
But it's not going
to be a time trial.

92
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,154
You're not going to be
racing to get the, you know.

93
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:09,439
AUDIENCE: Will it still be
worth as much as an exam?

94
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,230
PROFESSOR: It will.

95
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,770
Because to my mind,
part of the reason

96
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,900
to design the exam
this way is that it's

97
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,250
testing your conceptual
understanding, which

98
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,769
is the important thing.

99
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,930
So it will be.

100
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,470

101
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,880
Other questions?

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,380
All right.

103
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,450
So let's get started with
the clicker part of today.

104
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,950

105
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,743
So we're on channel 41.

106
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:44,120

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,610
So consider this
eigenvalue equation,

108
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,030
two derivatives on f-- it's
constant-- times f of x.

109
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,880

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,380
How many of these
are eigenfunctions

111
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,796
with the corresponding
eigenvalue?

112
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:32,308

113
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:34,230
You've got about 10 seconds.

114
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,870
So go ahead and
put in your clicks.

115
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:44,960

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,610
And so your-- whoops, oh sorry.

117
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,920
That just cleared your
responses, unfortunately.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,722
Don't worry, they're
saved in memory.

119
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,180
It just cleared
them off my screen.

120
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,380
So the responses-- here we go.

121
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,686
Oops, that didn't work.

122
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:04,880
Wow, it just totally
disappeared out of that app.

123
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Wow, that's so weird.

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,890

125
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,180
Oh no, that didn't work.

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,510
Let's try this.

127
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,850
Where did it go?

128
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,110
Ah, there it is.

129
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,705
Whoa, this is all
very confusing.

130
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,460

131
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,660
So that was your response,
B and C, 63% and 38%.

132
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,580
So let's go back to this.

133
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,305
Quickly discuss this
with your neighbor.

134
00:06:35,305 --> 00:07:03,200

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,400
And now go ahead and
click in your new answers

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,170
if you-- you can keep
talking, that's fine.

137
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:18,840

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,725
Another five seconds.

139
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,890

140
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,850
Awesome.

141
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,990
OK, that's it.

142
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,330
So the answer is B. And
99% of you all got that.

143
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,310
I suspect someone didn't click.

144
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,910
OK good, next question.

145
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,000
Psi I and Psi II
are two solutions

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,830
of the Schrodinger equation.

147
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,857
Is the sum of the two of them
with coefficients A and B

148
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,820
also a solution of the
Schrodinger equation?

149
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,140
Oh, and I forgot to
start the clicky thingy.

150
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,949
So click now.

151
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,910
AUDIENCE: Did you mean to
say B Psi 2 on that thing?

152
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,290
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, it is
supposed to say B Psi 2.

153
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,810
It says B Psi 2 on
the next-- sorry,

154
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,340
it's A Psi I plus
B Psi I. It should

155
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,460
say I Psi I plus B Psi II.

156
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,032
Thank you.

157
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,032
AUDIENCE: Does it mean
that the same Schrodinger

158
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:07,480
equation with the
same potential?

159
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,188
PROFESSOR: Yeah, with
the same potential.

160
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,486
Yeah, Yeah.

161
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:16,230
[LAUGHTER]

162
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,170
PROFESSOR: Wow, Yeah.

163
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,170
So you know Einstein said,
God didn't play dice.

164
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,032
And let me paraphrase
that as, God doesn't

165
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:23,490
mess with you in
clicker questions.

166
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,010

167
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,530
And you guys have effectively
universally that the answer

168
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,950
is A, yes,
superposition principle.

169
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:40,750
OK next question is going to
be for answer-- here we go.

170
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,670
Consider an infinite
square well with width a.

171
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,500
And compared to the
infinite square well with A,

172
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,610
the ground state
of a finite well

173
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,905
is lower, higher, same
energy, or undetermined.

174
00:08:54,905 --> 00:09:04,490

175
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,350
You've got 10 seconds, so
continue thinking through this.

176
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,370

177
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:11,965
5 seconds.

178
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:15,040

179
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,912
OK, and you mostly
got it, but have

180
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,620
a quick chat with the
person next to you.

181
00:09:19,620 --> 00:10:00,370

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,015
All right, let's try again.

183
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:08,170

184
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,125
Such a good technique.

185
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,980

186
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,230
All right, another five
seconds to put in your answer.

187
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,729
4-3-2-1.

188
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:20,420

189
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,797
And you virtually all got
it right, a lower energy.

190
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,630
And let's just think
about this intuitively.

191
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,867
Intuitively, the gradient of the
potential is the force, right?

192
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:30,700
So in the second case,
you've got less force

193
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,760
cramming the article
inside the box

194
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,980
so it's being
squeezed less tightly.

195
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,759
More physically,
you see that there

196
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,300
is an evanescent
tail on the outside.

197
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,650
What that tells you
is the wave function

198
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,510
didn't have to go
to zero at the ends.

199
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,129
It just had to get small and
latch onto a dying exponential.

200
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,420
That's from the qualitative
analysis of wave functions.

201
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,040
But meanwhile,
what that tells you

202
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,350
is, it has to curve less inside
in order-- it doesn't have

203
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,726
to get to zero, it just
has to get to a small value

204
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,600
where it matches to the
decaying exponential.

205
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
So if the curvature is less,
then the energy is less.

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,610
Cool?

207
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,990
OK, next question.

208
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,601
So any questions
on that before I?

209
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:12,100
Good.

210
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,440

211
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Time zero wave function
infinite well with a

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,530
is this, sine squared
with a normalization.

213
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,660
What's the wave function
at a subsequent time t?

214
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:35,690

215
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,360
I will remind you
that you have solved

216
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
the problem of the
infinite square well,

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,940
and you know what
the eigenenergies

218
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,040
and eigenfunctions
are of the energy

219
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,002
operator in the
infinite square well.

220
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,460
So remember back
to what those are.

221
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,040

222
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,830
All right, and you
have five seconds.

223
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,130

224
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,780
OK, we are at about
50-50 correct.

225
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,280
So chat with the
person next to you.

226
00:12:08,280 --> 00:13:01,406

227
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,910
All right.

228
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,245
And now, any moment, go
ahead and vote again.

229
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:18,870

230
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,500
Good, five more seconds and
then put in your final vote.

231
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,220

232
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,690
OK, that's it for now.

233
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,582
So what's the answer?

234
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:31,040
D is the answer, but a lot of
people still had some doubts.

235
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,410
So who wants to give an
explanation for why it's D?

236
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:39,360

237
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,696
AUDIENCE: So sine squared
is not an eigenfunction.

238
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,624
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

239
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,034
AUDIENCE: So in some
way it hast to be

240
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,540
a summation of eigenfunctions.

241
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,010
So not even having to know
what the eigenfunctions are,

242
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,420
there's only one
summation in it.

243
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,720

244
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,055
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

245
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,790
AUDIENCE: And if you do know
what the eigenfunctions are,

246
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,460
now you know that [INAUDIBLE].

247
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,830
PROFESSOR: Brilliant, so
I'm going to restate that.

248
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,660
That was exactly
correct in every step.

249
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,100
So the first thing is, that
wave function at time 0,

250
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,160
sine squared of x, is not an
eigenfunction of the energy

251
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
operator for the system.

252
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,539
In fact, we've computed the
eigenfunctions for the energy

253
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,080
operator in the
infinite square well,

254
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,340
and they're sines where
they get a zero at the ends.

255
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,380
On the other hand, any function
satisfying the boundary

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,910
conditions-- normalizable,
hits zero at the boundaries--

257
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,740
is a superposition of
energy eigenfunctions,

258
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,350
and we can use that to determine
the time evolution we take

259
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,520
that superposition
and add on a phase-- e

260
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,480
to the minus i et upon h
bar for each of the energy

261
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,330
eigenfunctions.

262
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,530
And in part D we
express that wave

263
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,850
function as a superposition with
the coefficient cn determined

264
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,830
from the overlap of our
original function and the energy

265
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,960
eigenfunctions.

266
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,070
Everyone cool with that?

267
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,390
So this is literally just
a transcription of one

268
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,670
of our postulates.

269
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,620
OK, questions?

270
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,440

271
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,180
If you have any questions
at all, ask them.

272
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,410
This is the time to ask them.

273
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,750
Yeah.

274
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,759
AUDIENCE: So the way
get cn [INAUDIBLE]?

275
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,550
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

276
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,360
So the way you get
cn is by saying,

277
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,530
look I have my
wave function, psi

278
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:23,780
of x is equal to sum
over n cn phi n of z,

279
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,360
where these phi n's
energy eigenfunctions.

280
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,320
E phi n is equal
to en phi m of x.

281
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,600

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,130
And we also know that
the integral of phi n's

283
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,734
complex conjugate phi
m is equal to delta mn.

284
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,150
This is the statement
that they're

285
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,940
orthogonal and
properly normalized.

286
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,770
We also write this as
equal to phi n phi m.

287
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,370
And we can use this
to determine the cn is

288
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,260
equal to the inner product of
phi m with our wave function.

289
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,040
This is equal to the integral
dx phi star phi n star

290
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,320
psi, which is equal to
the integral dx phi n star

291
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,990
sum over m of cm phi m.

292
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,510
But this sum over m of
cm can be pulled out

293
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,080
because this is just an integral
over a sum of terms, which

294
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,900
is the same as the sum
over m cm integral phi

295
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,040
m-- complex conjugate-- phi m.

296
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,584
And that's delta mn, which
is 0 unless n is equal to m,

297
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,500
because these guys are
orthogonal and properly

298
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,250
normalized.

299
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,246
So this is zero unless
n is equal to m.

300
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:44,120
So in the sum, the only
term that contributes

301
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,860
is when m is equal to
n, this is equal to cn.

302
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,630
So cn is given by the
overlap of our wave function

303
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,600
with the corresponding
eigenfunction.

304
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,470
This allows us to take our
function, a known function--

305
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,870
for example, sine squared--
and express the coefficients

306
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,730
in terms of an overlap of our
wave function sine squared

307
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,530
with the wave functions sine.

308
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,670
And that's exactly the
expression you see below,

309
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,572
cn is equal to the
integral of sine

310
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,030
squared-- our wave
function-- times

311
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,696
sine, which is the
energy eigenfunction.

312
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,703

313
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:15,369
Other questions?

314
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,050

315
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,910
OK, great.

316
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,819

317
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,220
Next problem.

318
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,295
Come to me computer.

319
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:33,535

320
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,160
Why can they just be
written in Python.

321
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,465
OK, good.

322
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:41,900
the eigenstates phi n--
which we usually call psi n,

323
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,280
but there it is-- form
an orthonormal set.

324
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,380
Meaning integral of phi
m star phi n is delta mn.

325
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,686
What is the value of integral
psi m against the sum cn phi n?

326
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:57,220

327
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,904
You've got five seconds.

328
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,320
I'll give you a
little extra time,

329
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,695
because people
are clicking away.

330
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:07,954

331
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,370
OK you now have seven seconds,
because time is non-linear.

332
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:16,460

333
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,890
OK, so quickly discuss,
because there's still

334
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,920
some ambiguity here.

335
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:37,650

336
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,600
All right, you have 10
seconds to modify your clicks.

337
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,100
Click.

338
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,390

339
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:51,350
All right, yes and the
answer is, C, excellent.

340
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,850
Right?

341
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,440
Because in fact,
we just did that.

342
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,510

343
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,070
That won't happen
on the actual exam.

344
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,150
So here's the next question.

345
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,800
Let the Hamiltonian
on a dagger Un

346
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,980
equal en plus h
omega-- that should

347
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,720
be an h bar-- a dagger Un.

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
What can you say
about a dagger Un?

349
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,310

350
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,710
Here we should
probably say, what

351
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:26,380
can one say, because
it's possible-- OK,

352
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,050
what can one say?

353
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:38,560

354
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,464
Here the assumption--
just to say it out

355
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:42,630
loud-- the assumption is
that Un is an eigenfunction

356
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,300
of the energy operator
h with eigenvalue en.

357
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,171

358
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,170
You've got five seconds.

359
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,880

360
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,340
All right, we are at 50/50.

361
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,130
So discuss amongst yourselves.

362
00:20:04,130 --> 00:21:17,240

363
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,905
All right.

364
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:21,792

365
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,000
OK, go ahead and enter again.

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,710
Enter your modified guesses.

367
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,575
And you have 10
seconds to do so.

368
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:29,450
This is a lot better.

369
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,350

370
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,687
OK, this is great.

371
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,770
So this is one of those
really satisfying moments.

372
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,990
It's improved, but there's
still some real doubt here.

373
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,150
So I would like to get
one person to argue

374
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,100
for b and one person
to argue for c.

375
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,250
So who wants to volunteer
for each of those?

376
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,440
AUDIENCE: I'll argue for c.

377
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,475
PROFESSOR: Who's
going to argue for b?

378
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,721
Someone's got to
argue for b, come on.

379
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:55,720
AUDIENCE: You can argue.

380
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,160
PROFESSOR: I'm not
going to argue for b.

381
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm not going to
argue for c either.

382
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,385
That defeats the purpose.

383
00:21:59,385 --> 00:21:59,880
I'm the professor.

384
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,213
I have to say this all the time.

385
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:04,600
So who's going to argue for b?

386
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,490
OK, you argue for b.

387
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,270
Who's going to argue for c?

388
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,420
All right, yeah,
that worked out well.

389
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,222
Great.

390
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:14,830
Argue for b.

391
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,255
You can do it.

392
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,463
AUDIENCE: So I originally
accidentally mis-clicked b,

393
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,700
so I guess I can do this.

394
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,780
So originally I didn't
read the question,

395
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,700
and I thought since you
were acting the letter

396
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,770
operator on the
eigenstate that you'd

397
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,450
get a proportionality constant
times some eigenstate.

398
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,550
So that's why it could
potentially be b.

399
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,360
But I disbelieve.

400
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,010
PROFESSOR: It's not the best
argument imaginable for b,

401
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,150
but we'll take it.

402
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,240
So thank you.

403
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,385

404
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,260
When I put someone in
an impossible position.

405
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,427
So c.

406
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:51,260
AUDIENCE: All right.

407
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,715
I argue for c.

408
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,867
So we can see just
from the first line

409
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:59,191
here that this is clearly going
to be a stationary [INAUDIBLE].

410
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:03,120
However, we can also see that
it is a distinctly different

411
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,532
energy from the
state that you get

412
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,740
an eigenfunction [INAUDIBLE].

413
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,476
So I said c, because it
was not the same state.

414
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:10,350
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

415
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,210
That's exactly right.

416
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,000
So let me walk through that.

417
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,080
Let me say that allowed.

418
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,030
So from the first line, it
is clear that the object a Un

419
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,860
is an eigenfunction of
the energy operator.

420
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,760
And it's got eigenvalue
en plus h omega.

421
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,927
So it is a stationary state.

422
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,926
It's an eigenfunction of
the energy [INAUDIBLE].

423
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:29,890
However, it is not the
same one, because it

424
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,610
has a different eigenvalue.

425
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,640
So what it means to be
the same energy eigenstate

426
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,730
is it has the same eigenvalue.

427
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,702
If it has a different
energy eigenvalue,

428
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:40,660
it is a different state
and they're orthogonal.

429
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,730
We proved this before.

430
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,020
Two states with different
energy are orthogonal.

431
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,580
So not only are
they not the same,

432
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,580
they don't even
have any overlap.

433
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,590
So it is a stationary
state, but it's not

434
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,744
proportional with the state Un.

435
00:23:52,744 --> 00:23:53,660
It's an important one.

436
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,130

437
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,020
Questions about that one
before we move on to the next?

438
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,520
AUDIENCE: How did
you tell that it's

439
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,935
proportional to the state Un?

440
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:06,060
PROFESSOR: If it were
proportional to the state Un,

441
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,911
then it would be some
constant times Un.

442
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,910
That's what we mean by
saying it's proportional.

443
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,410
But then if we acted on it
with the energy operator,

444
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,264
what would the eigenvalue be?

445
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,180
Let me say this again.

446
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,972
Suppose I have a
state the Un, which

447
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:20,180
I know that if I act with
the energy operator on it--

448
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,140
or this is sometimes called
h Un is equal to En Un.

449
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,990

450
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,560
If I act with E on alpha Un,
where alpha's a constant,

451
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,620
what is this equal to?

452
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,560
Alpha EnUn.

453
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,100
So the eigenvalue is the same.

454
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,280
It's En, because it can
divide through by [INAUDIBLE].

455
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,240
So if you have the same state--
meaning proportional to it--

456
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,740
then we'll have the
same eigenvalue.

457
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,430
But this manifestly has
a different eigenvalue.

458
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,540
Cool?

459
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,527
Awesome, OK other questions?

460
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,219
Yeah.

461
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,510
AUDIENCE: I must have missed
the-- this is [INAUDIBLE].

462
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,660
What is the [INAUDIBLE].

463
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,930
PROFESSOR: Ah, good.

464
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,350
So H is another name.

465
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,020
So some books use H
and some books use E.

466
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,300
And the reason goes back
to classical mechanics.

467
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,080
There's an object called
the Hamiltonian, which

468
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,890
is sort of like
saying-- I don't know.

469
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,880
It's like saying bread
and [NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

470
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,210
are the same thing.

471
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,620
But they evoke different things.

472
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,354
You say bread and
you think like Dixie.

473
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,020
And you say
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] and you

474
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,060
think, the me of some
gorgeous baguette.

475
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,310
It has a different feel.

476
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,410
It has a different feel.

477
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,870
So this evokes different things.

478
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,120
In particular, to a
classical mechanic

479
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,192
the Hamiltonian is the
generator of time translations.

480
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:40,650
Now, we don't
usually-- that wasn't

481
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,020
the classic way of thinking
about the energy operator

482
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,510
in, say, Newton's time.

483
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,500
But it is how we think
about energy now.

484
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,169
So that's just terminology.

485
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:51,210
For anyone who didn't get
that, sorry about that.

486
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,700
This is something that
we've run across before,

487
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,037
but I should emphasize.

488
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,870
So when you hear people
say the Hamiltonian,

489
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,576
that means the energy operator.

490
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:00,200
The reason I say
energy operator rather

491
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
than saying
Hamiltonian-- which is

492
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,489
the more common thing in
the Lingua Franca of quantum

493
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,738
mechanics-- is because I
want to impress upon you guys

494
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:06,770
that it's just energy.

495
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,810
It is the energy,
it's nothing else.

496
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,520
It's not some strange beast.

497
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,040
It's just energy.

498
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,686
Other questions?

499
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,617
AUDIENCE: Which one's the bread?

500
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,325
PROFESSOR: Bread.

501
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:22,969

502
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:23,635
Other questions?

503
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:27,420

504
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,330
Next question.

505
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,190
Which of these graphs shows the
curvature of the wave function

506
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,230
in a classically allowed region?

507
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:41,390

508
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,630
OK, five seconds left.

509
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,410

510
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,680
All right, fantastic.

511
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,770
And the answer is a,
because the curvature

512
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,110
has to be towards the axis.

513
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,820
In the classically
allowed region,

514
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,980
the wave function is sinusoidal.

515
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,900
it's oscillatory.

516
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,970
All right, and-- whoops.

517
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,670
And the partner of
that question is,

518
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,670
what about in the classically
disallowed region?

519
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:17,940

520
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,596
Five seconds.

521
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:22,680

522
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,970
OK, awesome, and basically
everyone got this.

523
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,501
B, great.

524
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:28,000
Questions?

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,652

526
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,548
Yeah, sorry.

527
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:37,422
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

528
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,477
PROFESSOR: No.

529
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,810
No, that's a very good question.

530
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,185
So C and D, let me be a little
bit more precise about it.

531
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:45,051
It's a very reasonable question,
so let me give you an answer.

532
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:46,550
Suppose you saw a
wave function that

533
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,060
had the curvature
structure of C.

534
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,820
It was curved
oscillatory over there

535
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,670
and curved exponential
over there on the right.

536
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,860
What would you say about
the potential relative

537
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,510
to the energy?

538
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,550

539
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,420
Say again?

540
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,080
Yeah, good.

541
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,720
So on one side we're allowed,
and on the other side

542
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,444
we're disallowed.

543
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,860
So if you saw a
wave function that

544
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,440
had that curvature
structure, you'd

545
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,132
immediately know that it was
an allowed region on the left.

546
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,340
But then on the right, it
was classically disallowed,

547
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,500
because it had curvature
away from the axis.

548
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,196
That cool?

549
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,320
So if you saw a wave
function-- so for example, you

550
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,570
might say look, you never get
a wave function that does this.

551
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,970
And that's not true.

552
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,140

553
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,110
You could do that.

554
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,950
So this would be
classically disallowed,

555
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,214
because it's curvature down.

556
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,630
This would be
classically allowed.

557
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,252
So the potential, for example,
if this is the energy,

558
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:38,210
the potential could be.

559
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,760

560
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,592
So a potential like this could
lead to a function like this.

561
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:49,800
So it's a very good question.

562
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,060
I'm sorry, I should
have seen what

563
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,434
you were asking
more immediately.

564
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:54,909

565
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:56,450
Other questions
following up on that?

566
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,470

567
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,354
No one ever asked
that question before.

568
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:05,770
And I just want to emphasize
that you guys should just ask

569
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,640
questions when you don't--
when you've confused about

570
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,170
something, someone else is
going to be confused about it.

571
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,820
I wouldn't even necessarily
know that the question

572
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,861
is a meaningful question.

573
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:13,760
I get questions I've
never heard before all

574
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,986
the time in this class.

575
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,110
Just don't hesitate to ask.

576
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,370
It's always a good idea.

577
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,840
OK, next one.

578
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,580
Wave function psi
has been expressed

579
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,506
as a sum over energy
eigenfunction Un.

580
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,130
Compared to the
original wave function,

581
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,870
is a function of x a
set of coefficients,

582
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,607
C1 dot dot dot contains more
or less, same information?

583
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:32,690
Or it can't be determined?

584
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,190
Or depends?

585
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,170

586
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,750
Five seconds.

587
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,880

588
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
And the answer is.

589
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,704
AUDIENCE: C.

590
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:44,870
PROFESSOR: Same information.

591
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,495
Good questions.

592
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:49,425

593
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:50,800
Some of these
you've seen before.

594
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,638

595
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:58,010
f and g are wave functions
and c is a constant.

596
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,530
Then the inner product
cf with g is equal to?

597
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,595
Click away, 10 seconds.

598
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:11,150

599
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,680
All right.

600
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,560

601
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,870
OK, you've got
about five seconds.

602
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,840
Still a lot of
fluctuations here.

603
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,770
Wow, I'm surprised by this one.

604
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,404
Yeah, question.

605
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,570
AUDIENCE: Sorry, quick
question on the previous one.

606
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,430
PROFESSOR: Oh, let's come
back to the previous one

607
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,500
after we do this one.

608
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,700
Thanks.

609
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,850
But remind me too
after we move on.

610
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,650
So discuss, because about 1/3
of you got this one wrong.

611
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,175
So discuss.

612
00:30:38,175 --> 00:31:13,280

613
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,871
So go ahead and put
in your answers again.

614
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,370
Good.

615
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:24,137

616
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,470
All right, another five seconds.

617
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,610

618
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,032
OK, and the answer is.

619
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:34,740
Good, get that complex
conjugation right.

620
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Little things like
that can cause

621
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,860
you an infinite
amount of trouble.

622
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,276
Especially as you'll notice
on the problem set when you're

623
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:42,037
computing time dependence
of expectation values,

624
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:43,620
getting that complex
conjugation right

625
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,250
is essential, because you need
to see interference terms.

626
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,380
And without the
complex conjugation

627
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,296
you will not get the
right interference terms.

628
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:51,064

629
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,980
Oh yeah, a question from
the previous problem.

630
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,316
Thank you.

631
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:59,146
AUDIENCE: So since the
summation with the constants,

632
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:01,319
doesn't that
technically give you

633
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,440
the probability of each
individual eigenstate?

634
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,952
PROFESSOR: The norm squared
gives you the probabilities.

635
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:09,410
But if you know
the coefficients---

636
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,380
so this is a good question.

637
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,713
So let me rephrase the question.

638
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:16,230
The question is, in the
previous question we said,

639
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,280
our wave function phi of
x is some function which

640
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,257
we could draw.

641
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:21,840
So I could represent
this in two ways.

642
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,160
I could either draw it,
or I could represent

643
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,635
it as equal the sum
over n of cn phi

644
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:30,620
n where phi n are the
known energy functions.

645
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,109
And the question is, did the cn
contain the same information?

646
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:35,150
So that was the question.

647
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,030
And the point that's
being asked about here

648
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,210
is a very good question.

649
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,720
The question is, look, we
know what these cn's mean.

650
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,940
What the cn's mean
is the probability

651
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,575
that you measure
the energy-- given

652
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:47,950
that the state of psi, the
probability [INAUDIBLE] energy

653
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,920
En is equal to norm cn squared.

654
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,147
And so the cn's tell
you about probabilities.

655
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:55,730
They don't tell you
what the state is.

656
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,860
They just tell you
what a probability

657
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,150
is that you'll measure
a particular energy.

658
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,180
Is that right?

659
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,442
So how can it contain
the same information?

660
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,650
And there are two important
things to say about this.

661
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,190
First off, this
is of course true.

662
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,871
And this does give
you the probability.

663
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:10,870
And the probability comes
from the norm squared.

664
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,430
So the phase of cn doesn't
particularly matter for that.

665
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,800
However the claim that I
can expand this function

666
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,140
in a basis of the
energy eigenfunctions,

667
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,740
in a basis of other
functions, is a statement

668
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,130
that if know these cn's, then
I take c1 multiplied by phi 1,

669
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,810
c2 multiplied by phi 2,
add them all back up,

670
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,490
and I get nothing other
than this original function.

671
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,690
So if I know the
cn's, I can just

672
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,780
construct that original
function explicitly.

673
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,130
So this can't contain
any more or any less

674
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,230
information than the
list of cn's, as long

675
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,690
as I know what basis
I'm talking about.

676
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,750
So here's the disturbing
thing about that.

677
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,960
When we say the wave function
is the state of the system--

678
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,290
it contains all knowledge you
could possibly have access to.

679
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,600
And not just knowledge that
you could have access to,

680
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,877
it contains all of the
information of the state.

681
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,710
And then we look at
this and say, well look,

682
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,970
it doesn't give us
something deterministic.

683
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,270
It gives us something
probabilistic.

684
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,780
It tells us the
probability distribution

685
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,440
for measuring the various
different energies.

686
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,719
What does that
immediately tell you

687
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,260
since they're
equivalent information?

688
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,559
This guy tells you nothing
more than the probabilities.

689
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,600
It doesn't tell you what
energies you'll measure,

690
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,550
it tells you the
probabilities with which

691
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,670
you will measure energies.

692
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,360
So they're the same thing.

693
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,730
It's a very good question.

694
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,034
And I think the way to take
the sort of discomfort--

695
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:27,409
I don't know about
you-- but that

696
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,190
causes me is just to read
that as saying, look,

697
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,579
the wave function is giving
you probabilistic information

698
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,118
about measurements.

699
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:34,114
AUDIENCE: I get that.

700
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,596
It's just that if you have
a wave function written

701
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:42,082
as that or a wave function
written as the [INAUDIBLE],

702
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,440
I just see-- since
it's written that way,

703
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,890
then you know what
all the cn's are

704
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,340
and what all the
possible eigenstates are.

705
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,790
And just [INAUDIBLE].

706
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,240
I understand they both
contain the same information,

707
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,710
but just written as each.

708
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,220
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

709
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,070
So let me turn this around.

710
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,020
Let me phrase this
slightly different.

711
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,895
Tell me if this is
getting at the same point.

712
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:03,043
If I gave you a list
of numbers, 1, 14, 12,

713
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:06,600
does that tell you what
function I'm talking about?

714
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,170
No.

715
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,910
I have to tell you that they're
the expansion coefficients

716
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,800
in, say, sine waves of
a particular wavelength.

717
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,300
Or energy eigenfunctions of
some particular energy operator.

718
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,270
If I just give you
a list of numbers,

719
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,450
it doesn't tell you
what function it is.

720
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,600
I have to give you
a list of numbers,

721
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,100
and I have to tell you what
basis I'm talking about.

722
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,620
If you have the
wave function, you

723
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,745
don't need to know what
basis you're talking about.

724
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:26,620
The wave function is
basis independent.

725
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,780
It's just the function.

726
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,260
In a few minutes, I'm going
to come back and subvert

727
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,809
what I just said.

728
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,100
So the wave function is just
what the wave function is.

729
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,920
And if I give you
a list of numbers,

730
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,740
they're only equivalent when
you also know the wave function.

731
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,150
So in order for these two
things to be equivalent,

732
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,567
it's important that you know
what bases are talking about.

733
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,149
In particular, it's
important that you

734
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,550
know the energy eigenfunctions.

735
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,350
Is that getting at the
distinction you're making?

736
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,350
OK, think more about it.

737
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,094
And when the question
becomes more sharp, ask.

738
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:57,760
Other questions?

739
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,472

740
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,470
AUDIENCE: I think you kind of
covered what my question was.

741
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,700
But for the future, if the
question is phrased such

742
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,130
that if you know the cn's,
you know all the information,

743
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,580
are we supposed to just
infer that if we know the cn,

744
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,060
we also know [INAUDIBLE]?

745
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, usually.

746
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,300
I try on problem sets in exams
to make that distinction clear,

747
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,234
but that will
generally be assumed.

748
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:25,900
Other questions?

749
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,169

750
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:30,460
I'm going to come back to this.

751
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,918
I'm going to come
back to this when

752
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:35,030
we finish the clicker questions.

753
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,284
Next question.

754
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:37,700
In the simple
harmonic oscillator,

755
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,800
the eigenvalues-- as
we've described twice--

756
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,705
our En is h bar omega times
n plus 1/2 for an integer n,

757
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:47,330
and a measurement of
energy will always

758
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,630
observe one of these values.

759
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,890
That's from postulate four.

760
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,280
Three?

761
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,310
What can we say about
the expectation value

762
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,515
of the energy in
some arbitrary state?

763
00:36:56,515 --> 00:37:04,950

764
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,250
This one isn't tricky,
but it's not trivial.

765
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,450
So think carefully about it.

766
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:20,610

767
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,400
You have five seconds.

768
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,820
Enter your best guess.

769
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,690

770
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,840
And you are at complete chance.

771
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,830
I think we've just put you
through a hardness box.

772
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,660
So discuss.

773
00:37:38,660 --> 00:38:46,240

774
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,873
OK go ahead and start putting
in your modified response.

775
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:58,970

776
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,405
You have another
five seconds or so.

777
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:05,310

778
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,190
OK, click.

779
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,520
OK, there's still a lot
of disagreement here.

780
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,410
So let's see.

781
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,333
So who would like
to argue for C?

782
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:22,420

783
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,670
Who would like to argue for D?

784
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,880

785
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,510
Go ahead.

786
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,200
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'm
going to argue for D.

787
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,860
And against C. So C suggests
that we would measure

788
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,680
the value of the [INAUDIBLE]
only for eigenstate that it

789
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,720
addressed.

790
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,940
But even if that changed,
the stationary state

791
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,790
consists of one
and one eigenstate.

792
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,680

793
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,864
So if we were to
find the value, it

794
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:08,950
can still be a combination
of 1 and [INAUDIBLE].

795
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:15,297
And it doesn't have to fall
to a certain eigenvalue.

796
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:16,630
PROFESSOR: Excellent, excellent.

797
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,160
So let me restate that.

798
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,630
So the statement-- if
I'm following your logic.

799
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,290
Thank you.

800
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,820
So at the statement if
I'm following your logic

801
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,861
goes something like this.

802
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:28,620
Look, if we had the
wave function which

803
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,840
was phi sub n times some
phase, some ridiculous phase.

804
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,930
Let's say the phase was 1.

805
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,420
If we had the wave
function as phi sub n,

806
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,740
what will the expectation
value of the energy operator

807
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,900
be in this state?

808
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,770

809
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,450
En, right?

810
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,160
Because it's the energy.

811
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,770
It's a sum of all possible n
of En times the probability

812
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,820
that we measure
En, by definition,

813
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,860
but this is equal to
sum over n of En times

814
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,540
the expansion coefficient of
our wave function in the energy

815
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,270
eigenstate basis cn squared.

816
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,011
Now, what's the
expansion coefficient

817
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,260
in our energy eigenbasis here?

818
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,040
It's 1 for a particular value
of n, and 0 for everything else.

819
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,330
So what will our answer be?

820
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,184
It will be 0 for
everything except 1

821
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:14,350
for a particular value En
corresponding to little m.

822
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,080
I should really call this m, so
that dummy variables that we're

823
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,580
summing over don't matter.

824
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,250
So for this particular case
the expectation value of e

825
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,130
is equal to En.

826
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,130
Everyone cool with that?

827
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,150
So it certainly can be En.

828
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,160
But is this the
only way to get En?

829
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,660
No.

830
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:42,760
So for example, suppose we have
alpha phi 1 plus beta phi 3.

831
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,427
What will the answer be?

832
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:46,510
Now first off, in order
to make this normalizable,

833
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,593
what does beta have to be?

834
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:52,960
It needs to be square of 1
minus alpha norm squared.

835
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,800
Just so that they sum
to 1 when norm squared.

836
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,370
So what I want to plot
now the expectation

837
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:04,420
value of the energy as
a function of alpha.

838
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,140
When alpha is 0, what
is the expectation value

839
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,440
of the energy?

840
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,060
E3.

841
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,700
When alpha is 1-- which it can't
be anything greater than 1--

842
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,150
when alpha is 1, what
is the expectation value

843
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,900
of the energy?

844
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,910
E1.

845
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,050
And how does the expectation
value of the energy

846
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,380
vary between these two
as a function of alpha?

847
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,830
Well, it's smooth.

848
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,700
In particular, it's
quadratic because it

849
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,080
goes like the square
of these coefficients.

850
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,090
So it's something smooth
that does this and has

851
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,680
slope 0 at the end.

852
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,750
And somewhere in
between, it will hit E2.

853
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,070
But not only is this
not equal to E2,

854
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:52,050
it doesn't even contain E2 as
an element of the superposition.

855
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:58,380
So this is a counter-example to
C. This is an important point.

856
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,640
Now if I know that at
some moment in time,

857
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,450
the energy expectation
value is this value,

858
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,610
corresponding let's say
to some particular alpha,

859
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,120
and I let the system
evolve in time,

860
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,960
how does that expectation
value evolve in time?

861
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,390

862
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,530
How does the expectation value
of the energy change over time?

863
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,000
It doesn't.

864
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,177
The expectation value of energy
is always time independent.

865
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:30,740

866
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,880
Does the expectation value
of position change over time?

867
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,250
In general, yes.

868
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,300
When does it not
change over time?

869
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,040
In a stationary state.

870
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,129
So working through
this is what's

871
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:44,670
on your previous
problem set, as well

872
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,292
as on your current problem set.

873
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,250
AUDIENCE: So is this
anything like conservation

874
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,340
of energy, where the
expectation value of energy

875
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,540
needs to stay the same if
there's nothing going on?

876
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,820
PROFESSOR: Excellent, it
sort of sounds like that.

877
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,529
We'll make a sharp
version of that later.

878
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:00,903
So you should have that tinkling
in the back of your head

879
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:03,400
as like, oh look, we have a
time independent potential,

880
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,780
energy is conserved.

881
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,617
That sounds kind of like the
expectation value is constant.

882
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,200
But we need to make
that more precise.

883
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,950
So we'll find a precise
version of that statement later

884
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:11,950
in the semester.

885
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,450
But it's a very good
intuition to have.

886
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,730
Other questions?

887
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,059
OK, so the answer is D.
And you guys were about 4/5

888
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:22,850
on that at the end.

889
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,453

890
00:44:25,453 --> 00:44:27,280
Oops, that was not right.

891
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,860

892
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,940
OK, next one.

893
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,790
This is a three-step question.

894
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,750
We have observable A and B with
eigenstates psi 1 and psi 2,

895
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,700
and phi 1 and phi 2 of
A and B, and eigenvalues

896
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,802
of a1, a2, and b1, b2.

897
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:46,590
And the eigenstate's related
in this linear fashion.

898
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,390
I measure observable A
and get the value of a1.

899
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,257
What's the state immediately
after that measurement?

900
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,340
What is the wave function?

901
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:06,250

902
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:06,835
Five seconds.

903
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:11,980

904
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,270
2-1.

905
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,620
Click away.

906
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,030
So there's pretty strong
agreement among you all

907
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,156
that the answer is A, and
that is indeed the answer.

908
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:22,655
Questions?

909
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:27,550

910
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,614
So a slightly less obvious one.

911
00:45:31,614 --> 00:45:33,280
Immediately after
this measurement of A,

912
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,920
observable B is measured.

913
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,770
What's the probability
the b1 is found?

914
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:54,980

915
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,230
Wow, there's some amazing
initial transience there.

916
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,780

917
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,612
I could use the first
couple of seconds

918
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:04,820
as a random number generator.

919
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,080

920
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,000
OK, that's it.

921
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,110
And there's actually
a third of you

922
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,420
disagree with the
correct answer.

923
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,920
So I'm going to invite you
to chat with each other.

924
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:45,515

925
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:46,890
Go ahead and update
your answers.

926
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:54,620

927
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,786
OK, five more seconds.

928
00:46:55,786 --> 00:46:59,720

929
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,820
One second.

930
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,560
OK, nice.

931
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,060
Excellent.

932
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,630
You guys went from about 65%
to 90%, so that was great.

933
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,530
The answer is E.
It's the norm squared

934
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,250
of the coefficient of
eigenfunction corresponding

935
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,096
to b1 in the original
state, which was psi 1.

936
00:47:17,096 --> 00:47:19,960

937
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,580
Now imagine, on the other hand,
that the grad student doing

938
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,470
the measurement failed
to in fact measure

939
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,230
the observable B-- it was a bad
day-- but instead measured A

940
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:29,790
again.

941
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,590
What's the probability
that the second measurement

942
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,395
will yield a1?

943
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:36,710

944
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,120
Trust me on this one,
there's so many ways.

945
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,508
They read the package wrong,
they did the wrong measurement.

946
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

947
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,680
PROFESSOR: Sorry, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

948
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,530
Very good question.

949
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,670
He accidentally
measured B instead of A.

950
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

951
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,400
PROFESSOR: I mean A instead
of B. A instead of B. See

952
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,200
how easy it is to
make that mistake?

953
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,700
He accidentally
measured A instead of B.

954
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,810
I wish that was intentional.

955
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,950
OK, and so and we got
almost total unanimity.

956
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,584
The answer is B. Yes, question.

957
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:17,857
AUDIENCE: I was just going
to ask how quickly after.

958
00:48:17,857 --> 00:48:18,940
PROFESSOR: Great question.

959
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,481
Let's just assume
it's instantaneous.

960
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,470

961
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,020
Maybe sloppy, but
he's very quick.

962
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,200

963
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,090
OK, next question.

964
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,170
A system is in a state which
is a linear superposition of n

965
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,962
equals 1 and n equals 2
energy eigenstates, blah.

966
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:40,170
What's the probability that
measurement of the energy

967
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,516
will yield the first
energy eigenvalue?

968
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:47,480

969
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,400
Another five seconds, 2-3-4-5.

970
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,160

971
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,290
Great, you guys totally agree
that the answer is C. Great.

972
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:00,094
That's it for the clicker
questions for today.

973
00:49:00,094 --> 00:49:01,760
So here's the thing
I want to emphasize.

974
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,500
The first is that these
were totally conceptual.

975
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,820
They did not involve
any computations.

976
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,550
And yet, they're not trivial.

977
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,200
Some of them got 50%
consistently across the class.

978
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,570
So it's not just the
calculations that are hard.

979
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,710
Just thinking through the basic
premises, the basic postulates,

980
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,252
is really essential
at this point.

981
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,960
It's more important
than the computation.

982
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,812
Yeah.

983
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,678
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to post this?

984
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:29,886
PROFESSOR: I will post these.

985
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,100
I will post these.

986
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,910
Any questions remaining
after this-- oh, shoot!

987
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:37,710

988
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,260
I missed out on a
whole opportunity.

989
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,710
I'll do it next time.

990
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,440
Poo.

991
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,874
Any other questions before
we move on to lecture part?

992
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:46,790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

993
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,400
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
totally have to wait.

994
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah, you totally have to wait.

995
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,010
Any other questions?

996
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,974
Yeah.

997
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:56,015
AUDIENCE: Do you ever have
a [INAUDIBLE] function

998
00:49:56,015 --> 00:49:56,720
that's odd?

999
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,776
Or just continues
down [INAUDIBLE].

1000
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:01,650
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
a very good question.

1001
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,191
So the question is,
can you ever have

1002
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:05,230
a potential function
that is odd?

1003
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,006
So for example-- you're
actually asking two questions,

1004
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,130
so let me disentangle them.

1005
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:14,200
So one question is, can I
have an a potential function

1006
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,760
which is odd and linear?

1007
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,870
So it just ramps
all the way down.

1008
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,230
So does that seem physical?

1009
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,347
Is the energy
bounded from below?

1010
00:50:25,347 --> 00:50:27,180
Well, that's a not a
terribly good criterion

1011
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,580
because it's not bounded
from below for the Coulomb

1012
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,532
potential either.

1013
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,240
But in the case of
the Coulomb potential,

1014
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,510
it's not bounded from below
in a little tiny region.

1015
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,932
Not in a huge swath.

1016
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:42,140
So we're going to need a
better definition than this,

1017
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,060
but the short answer
to this one is no.

1018
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,880
This is not good.

1019
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,330
On the other hand, it's
not the oddness that's bad.

1020
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,230
It's that the
energy is continuing

1021
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,640
to be unbounded from below.

1022
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,590
So let me be more precise
than saying it's not happy.

1023
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,220
What important
for an observable?

1024
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,380
What's important
for the operator

1025
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,840
corresponding to an observable
in quantum mechanics?

1026
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,870
What property must
that operator have?

1027
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,844
It has to be Hermitian.

1028
00:51:10,844 --> 00:51:12,760
And [INAUDIBLE] that
implies real eigenvalues.

1029
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,176
It implies that there's a basis
of its eigenfunctions, all

1030
00:51:15,176 --> 00:51:17,100
these nice things.

1031
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,860
What we will find is that
the Coulomb potential--

1032
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,300
the hydrogen potential-- gives
us a nice Hermitian energy

1033
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,981
operator.

1034
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,480
We'll prove that
the energy operator

1035
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,940
self-adjoint on a problem set.

1036
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,770
However, this guy will not.

1037
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,230
So we're going to have one
that is not bounded from below.

1038
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,730
And so while there's a sense
in which it's Hermitian,

1039
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,300
there's not a good sense.

1040
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,600
It's got problems.

1041
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,340
But that's a more
technical detail.

1042
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,590
However, there's a second
part of your question, which

1043
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,090
is you could have
been asking, look,

1044
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,810
can you have a
potential that's odd

1045
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,280
but let's leave aside the
diverging at infinity.

1046
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,030
So for example, could
you have a potential

1047
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:55,920
that does this so that
it's odd, but it's bounded?

1048
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,960
And that's fine.

1049
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,210
Nothing wrong with that.

1050
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,420
So odd isn't a problem.

1051
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,326
The problem is certain
ways of diverging.

1052
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:05,051

1053
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:06,800
AUDIENCE: So what would
happen in the case

1054
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,841
where you did have some
kind of linear potential?

1055
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:12,724
You had a uniform electric
field and something was moving.

1056
00:52:12,724 --> 00:52:14,640
Is the problem that that
potential technically

1057
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,520
isn't a physical potential
because it doesn't go away?

1058
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,220
PROFESSOR: How would you ever
build a linear potential,

1059
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:20,720
right?

1060
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,397
So the question here
is, look, I know

1061
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:23,730
how to build a linear potential.

1062
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,110
Turn a uniform electric
field, and an electric field

1063
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,100
is the gradient to the
electrostatic potential.

1064
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,400
So that means that the
electrostatic potential

1065
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,334
is linear.

1066
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:32,250
And the potential energy
of a charged particle

1067
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,360
with charge Q in an
electrostatic potential

1068
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,409
is q times the
electrostatic potential.

1069
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:38,450
So the potential energy
for that charged particle

1070
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,609
is a linear function.

1071
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:40,900
So how do I build such a thing?

1072
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,310
Well, I take two
capacitor plates,

1073
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,370
and I dump some
charge on this one,

1074
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,869
and the opposite
charge on this guy,

1075
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,620
and I build up a
linear potential.

1076
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,484
Well yeah, exactly.

1077
00:52:47,484 --> 00:52:48,400
So that's the problem.

1078
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,450
So can I make this linear over
an arbitrarily large domain?

1079
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:51,950
No.

1080
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,900
I need an arbitrarily
large amount of charge,

1081
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,274
and I need to push them apart
from each other arbitrarily

1082
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:59,590
far, which takes an arbitrarily
large amount of work.

1083
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,520
That's not terribly
physical, right?

1084
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,160
Your arms are only so big.

1085
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,406
So at the end and
the day, we're always

1086
00:53:06,406 --> 00:53:08,530
going to discover that the
pathologies that show up

1087
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,696
in a potential like this,
like the Hamiltonian's not

1088
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:12,970
self-adjoint and
compactly supported

1089
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,240
[INAUDIBLE] continuous
functions, then OK.

1090
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,000
That's going to always be
some mathematical version of,

1091
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,190
your arms are only so big.

1092
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,990
You cannot build an infinitely
large apparatus like this.

1093
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,550
So yes, you're exactly right.

1094
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,320
It is not physical.

1095
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,973
Is it a mathematical
problem one could analyze?

1096
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:29,940
Yes.

1097
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,270
One could write a dissertation
on the singularity structure

1098
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,960
of these differential equations.

1099
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,750
But that dissertation would
never be read by a physicist.

1100
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,230

1101
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,392
Other questions?

1102
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:43,356
Yeah.

1103
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:45,647
AUDIENCE: Talking about the
rising and lowering number.

1104
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:48,964
Can you find the raising and
lowering for any [INAUDIBLE]

1105
00:53:48,964 --> 00:53:50,040
potential.

1106
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,290
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

1107
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,250
No.

1108
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,725
So here's what you can do.

1109
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,600
Suppose I have a bunch
of energy eigenstates.

1110
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,740
I have some potential.

1111
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,910
This is the potential.

1112
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,387
It's a crazy potential.

1113
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:01,220
And it has some definite
energy eigenvalues.

1114
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,480
As we've shown in 1D, or as
I've mentioned and proved

1115
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,100
in office hours, we can't
find degenerate eigenfunctions

1116
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,420
in a one-dimensional potential.

1117
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,810
So they're not degenerate.

1118
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,460
They're spaced a
finite distance apart

1119
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,140
for wave functions that
are convergent to 0

1120
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,470
and infinity for bound states.

1121
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,420
So we can always
construct an operator,

1122
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,820
which I will simply
define in this way.

1123
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,679
A, and just for flourish
I will put a dagger on it

1124
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,720
which does the following.

1125
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,240
A dagger is the
defined as the operator

1126
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,320
that maps phi n to
phi m, n plus 1.

1127
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,250
So what's the rule?

1128
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,480
It takes this state
to this state,

1129
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,605
this state to this state,
this state to this state.

1130
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:45,574
And since we can extend--
since these are a basis,

1131
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,990
then that tells us how this
acts on an arbitrary function,

1132
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,000
because it acts on the
superposition as acting

1133
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,610
on each term.

1134
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,310
So we can define it in this
way, but here's the question.

1135
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,900
What does it mean for
the raising operator

1136
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,220
to be the raising operator?

1137
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,530
It wasn't that it lifted
to raise the operator.

1138
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,920
That's not what started
out the whole machinery.

1139
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,220
Where the raising
operator got its juice was

1140
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,356
from this computational
relation, a dagger with E

1141
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:14,310
was equal to h bar
omega a dagger.

1142
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,910
So can we build an
operator a dagger

1143
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,060
that raises states and
commutes with the energy

1144
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,760
operator in this fashion?

1145
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,810
No, that depends on
the energy operator.

1146
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,130
This is not a general property.

1147
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,330
This is not always
something we can do.

1148
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,140
If we could, then
that energy operator

1149
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,630
would have evenly spaced
energy eigenfunctions.

1150
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:39,120
On the other hand, it's
not like it's never useful.

1151
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,770
So consider the
following example.

1152
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,510
And I think this was
on your problem set

1153
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,385
but I don't remember.

1154
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,280
So let me just say it.

1155
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,220
If we write a dagger
a is equal to n,

1156
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,580
then the commutation relation
for this-- so the energy

1157
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,340
operator for the
harmonic oscillator

1158
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,290
was equal to h bar
omega n plus 1/2.

1159
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,610
That's what we
derived last time.

1160
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:05,000
If we define a dagger a
as n, then the commutator

1161
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,280
of n with a dagger is a dagger.

1162
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,970
And the commutator of n
with a is equal to minus a.

1163
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:15,590

1164
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:26,240
Suppose the energy
operator is equal to h

1165
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,030
bar omega n plus n cubed.

1166
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,120

1167
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,270
Does the raising operator
commute with the energy

1168
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,380
operator to give
you a dagger again?

1169
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,930

1170
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,310
No, because it commutes to give
you an a dagger and it commutes

1171
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:49,650
with this guy to give you,
well, a constant times n

1172
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,890
squared a dagger, which is a
slightly funny [INAUDIBLE].

1173
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,140
So this doesn't have the
same computational relations.

1174
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,790
On the other hand, we know how
to build the functions of the n

1175
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,220
operator because they live
in a tower by this algebra.

1176
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,730
By this commutator relation,
they live in a tower.

1177
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,032
So I can build the
eigenfunctions of n.

1178
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:07,240
And then I can take those
eigenfunctions of n and act

1179
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,115
on them with e and
discover that they're also

1180
00:57:09,115 --> 00:57:10,000
eigenfunctions of e.

1181
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,140
Because e acting on them
is just n, and n cubed

1182
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,640
acting on the
eigenfunctions of n.

1183
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,977
So the states with
definite n are still

1184
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,560
eigenfunctions of
the energy operator.

1185
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,854
But they're not evenly spaced.

1186
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,270
Now can every
potential be written

1187
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,660
in terms of this n operator.

1188
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,250
So I leave that
you as an exercise.

1189
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,840
The answer is no.

1190
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,400
Try it.

1191
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1192
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:31,970
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

1193
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,886
So there's always something
you could formally

1194
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:35,040
define in this fashion.

1195
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,373
It's not always useful to
you, because it doesn't always

1196
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:39,362
commute with the energy
operator in a nice way.

1197
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:41,070
So then you can ask,
are there properties

1198
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:41,690
that aren't nice about this?

1199
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:44,023
Well, there's something called
the supersymmetric method

1200
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:46,050
in 1D quantum mechanics.

1201
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,610
But that's sort of
beyond the scope.

1202
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:51,910
Come to my office hours and
ask me this question again.

1203
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:56,740
This is a miracle of
the harmonic oscillator.

1204
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,280
Other questions?

1205
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,310
AUDIENCE: So to
construct the [INAUDIBLE]

1206
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,390
we use a condition
that a phi 0 is 0?

1207
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,460
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1208
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,760
AUDIENCE: So how did
we come up with that?

1209
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,810
Did we demand that on physical
grounds that it had to be 0?

1210
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,768
PROFESSOR: Yes, we did.

1211
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:09,730
So excellent question.

1212
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,140
So the question is this.

1213
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,030
When we constructed
using the operator method

1214
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,488
for the harmonic oscillator,
when we constructed the ground

1215
00:58:17,488 --> 00:58:19,867
state, we said the
ground state, phi 0,

1216
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:21,950
is that state which is
annihilated by the learning

1217
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:22,610
operator.

1218
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,680
A phi 0 is equal to 0.

1219
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,391
So where did that come from?

1220
00:58:25,391 --> 00:58:27,140
Were we forcing that
for physical reasons?

1221
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,181
For mathematical reasons?

1222
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:29,330
What was the reason?

1223
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:34,680
So this was very important,
so let's go through it slowly.

1224
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,270
So remember the step that came
immediately before this step.

1225
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,811
Immediately before
this step we said,

1226
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:41,540
look the expectation
value of energy

1227
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,010
can always be written as
a strictly positive thing.

1228
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,110
It's equal to the
integral and you

1229
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,620
should derive this for yourself.

1230
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,090
I didn't derive it, but
this is a good thing

1231
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,048
to derive for yourself.

1232
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,540
It takes only a couple of steps.

1233
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,420
Integral overall
momentum of psi tilde

1234
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,960
of p-- the Fourier
transformer norm squared.

1235
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,474
This is the probability that
you have given the state psi.

1236
00:58:59,474 --> 00:59:01,140
This is the probability
density that you

1237
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,130
have momentum p, p
squared upon 2 m.

1238
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:09,900
Plus the integral
dx psi of x norm

1239
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:14,285
squared m omega squared
upon 2 x squared.

1240
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,720
This is the probability
that you're at position

1241
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,180
x, given the wave function x.

1242
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,850
And that's the value
of the potential.

1243
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,160
Now this is a strictly
positive quantity, as is this.

1244
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,060
Strictly positive, as is this.

1245
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,980
This is a plus.

1246
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,140
This quantity must always be
greater than or equal to 0.

1247
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,190
Correct?

1248
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,490
However, we derive from
the operator relations

1249
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:38,820
that if we take away
function phi sub e

1250
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,120
and we act on it with
the lowering operator a,

1251
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,230
this defines a new state,
which up to some normalization

1252
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,720
is an eigenfunction of the
energy operator with energy

1253
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,400
e minus h bar omega.

1254
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,950
And we show this by showing that
the energy eigenfunction acting

1255
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:01,654
on this gives exactly this
coefficient times this back.

1256
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:02,570
It's an eigenfunction.

1257
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,420
We just showed explicitly
that it's an eigenfunction.

1258
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,711
So this suggest that if you
have a state with energy e,

1259
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:09,350
you could also build a state
with energy e minus h bar

1260
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,960
omega.

1261
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,330
And thus we can repeat
e minus 2 h bar omega,

1262
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,230
and this turtles
all the way down.

1263
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,630
The problem is, for
any finite value of e,

1264
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,480
eventually this tower
will get negative.

1265
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,040
Here's 0.

1266
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,156
But the energy expectation
value cannot be less than 0.

1267
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,780
It's got to be strictly
greater than 0.

1268
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,730

1269
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:33,260
But if we were in
this energy eigenstate

1270
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,260
and we measured the
expectation value of energy,

1271
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,560
this is the value we would
get, which would be negative.

1272
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,630
Whoops, that's a 2.

1273
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,680
So something is amiss.

1274
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,460
How can this
possibly make sense?

1275
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,600
And the answer up
with was, well look,

1276
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,570
it's inescapable that
acting with A n phi

1277
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:57,140
gives us something that's an
eigenfunction of the energy.

1278
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,320
However, it's possible
that this function

1279
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,330
happens to be the 0 function.

1280
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:07,140
Not 0 energy, just
0, not a function.

1281
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,280
Is zero normalizable?

1282
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,430
No, the integral
of 0 squared is 0.

1283
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:16,000
No coefficient times that
is a finite number, is 1.

1284
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,100
So what must happen is it must
be true that at some point

1285
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,520
we can't lower anymore.

1286
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,940
But we don't always act with
a, so we always try to lower.

1287
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,470
The only out is if when we
lower one particular guy, which

1288
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:32,600
I will call phi 0, the only out
is if we try to lower phi 0,

1289
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,236
we don't get another state--
which we see we did here.

1290
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:36,360
We don't get another state.

1291
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,940
Instead, we just get 0.

1292
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,240
We get no state.

1293
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,120
Not energy 0.

1294
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,060
0, the function is 0,
identically vanishing.

1295
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,585
This does not describe the
configuration of [INAUDIBLE].

1296
01:01:46,585 --> 01:01:49,240
The probability of it
being anywhere is 0.

1297
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,260
That's bad.

1298
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,750
So in order for
the tower to end,

1299
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,180
in order for the energy
to be bounded from below

1300
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,360
as the potential is,
we need that there's

1301
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,860
a lowest state in the tower.

1302
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,200
Does that answer your question?

1303
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1304
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,348
PROFESSOR: Great.

1305
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,571
Question?

1306
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,862
AUDIENCE: Are the energy
eigenfunctions always strictly

1307
01:02:10,862 --> 01:02:12,230
real?

1308
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,480
PROFESSOR: Very good question.

1309
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,710
You're going to show
this on a problem set

1310
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,330
if you haven't already.

1311
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,020
I thought you did,
but maybe not.

1312
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:25,650
The energy eigenfunctions
for potentials

1313
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,230
with only bound
states can always

1314
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,277
be expressed as purely
real or purely imaginary.

1315
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:33,860
You can always
decompose them in terms

1316
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,410
of purely real and
purely imaginary.

1317
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,050
Proving that will be a problem
on one of your problem sets.

1318
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,383
But for the moment, let me
just say, yes, you can always

1319
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,470
show that the energy
eigenfunctions

1320
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:47,974
for 1 D potential can always
be expressed as purely real.

1321
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:49,390
I need that bound
state condition,

1322
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,765
as we'll see later
in the course.

1323
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:51,733
Yes.

1324
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:55,677
AUDIENCE: So we lowered
the energy [INAUDIBLE].

1325
01:02:55,677 --> 01:02:59,621
And the next energy is 0, right?

1326
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:00,607
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1327
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,565
AUDIENCE: Isn't that supposed
to mean that the [INAUDIBLE] is

1328
01:03:03,565 --> 01:03:05,680
h omega, not h omega over 2?

1329
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,690
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

1330
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,430
No, good.

1331
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:11,920
So what this says is given
some state with energy e,

1332
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,697
when we lower it we
get h bar omega less.

1333
01:03:13,697 --> 01:03:15,030
That doesn't tell you what e is.

1334
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,200

1335
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,096
Other questions?

1336
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,470
AUDIENCE: Just to
expand on that.

1337
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:24,080
So if you get the 0 function,
that doesn't actually

1338
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,890
correspond to any energy
eigenvalue, let alone 0, right?

1339
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:28,990
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1340
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,930
The function 0 is
an eigenfunction

1341
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,150
of every operator.

1342
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,460
But it's a stupid eigenfunction
of every operator.

1343
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,030
In particuar, it
has nothing to do

1344
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,529
with the states
we're interested in.

1345
01:03:38,529 --> 01:03:41,679
We are interested in
normalizable states,

1346
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,220
and that is not a
normalizable state.

1347
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,240
You can't multiply it by
any finite coefficient

1348
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,580
and get 1 when you
square integrate it.

1349
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:53,350

1350
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,134
One last question.

1351
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:56,550
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
stupid question.

1352
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,451
But does that mean that the only
particle that can have 0 energy

1353
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:03,530
is the particle
that doesn't exist?

1354
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,704
PROFESSOR: Well, we need
to add more work to that.

1355
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,120
So the question
is, does that mean

1356
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,910
that the only particle that
could really have 0 energy

1357
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:14,560
is some imaginary particle
that doesn't exist.

1358
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,210
First off, imaginary
particles may exist.

1359
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,080
We just haven't seen them.

1360
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] real
particle [INAUDIBLE] 0 energy.

1361
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:22,750
PROFESSOR: Right.

1362
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,640
OK, so I need to say
two things about this.

1363
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,080
So there's a
technical complaint I

1364
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,170
need to make about
your question, which

1365
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:27,990
is a very fair question.

1366
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,310
But I need to make
it all the same.

1367
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,030
And the second is a
more physical answer.

1368
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:35,230
So the technical complaint is,
what do you mean by 0 energy?

1369
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,280
Do you ever measure
energy directly?

1370
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,740
You measure energy differences.

1371
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,791
So relative to what?

1372
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:41,290
We have to decide,
relative to what?

1373
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,880
So for example, in the
harmonic oscillator

1374
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,963
what we mean when we say
the [INAUDIBLE] energy is

1375
01:04:44,963 --> 01:04:47,060
non-zero is if we
draw the potential,

1376
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,250
and we call the minimum
of the potential e is 0,

1377
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,740
classical e is 0,
then what we discover

1378
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,420
is that the energy of the
quantum mechanical ground state

1379
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,480
is 1/2 h bar omega above 0.

1380
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,110

1381
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,270
So is there any state of
the harmonic oscillator

1382
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,108
with energy 0?

1383
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:06,510
No.

1384
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:11,220
If we have a free
particle, is there

1385
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,210
a configuration with energy 0?

1386
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,510
Well, that's an
interesting question.

1387
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,300
So what are the
eigenstates, e to the ikx.

1388
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,860

1389
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:28,370
When the energy is 0-- so the
energy is-- because it's just

1390
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:31,070
p squared upon 2m, which is h
bar squared k squared upon 2m,

1391
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,510
the energy is h bar
squared k squared up

1392
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:36,750
on 2m for a free
particle, no potential.

1393
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,960
And by 0 we mean the
asymptotic energy equals 0.

1394
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,250
Can you have a
state with energy 0?

1395
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,290
This one's a little subtle,
because if we take the energy

1396
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,120
0, what must k be?

1397
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:50,990
0, OK great.

1398
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,180
So what's the wave function?

1399
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,700
Constant.

1400
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,370
Is that normalizable?

1401
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,020
Not so much.

1402
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:08,100
So can you put a single particle
in a state with energy 0?

1403
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,810
No, that would not
seem to be possible,

1404
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,726
because that would be a
non-normalzable state.

1405
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:14,250
Well you say, we deal with
these exponentials all the time.

1406
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,500
We know how to deal with that.

1407
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,830
We don't use a
single wave-- plane

1408
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,470
wave-- we use a wave
packet with some width.

1409
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,170
So I can build a wave packet
with some average width,

1410
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:27,320
but will that average width ever
have an expectation value of k

1411
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,307
equals 0?

1412
01:06:29,307 --> 01:06:31,890
No, because it will always have
contributions from k not equal

1413
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:35,040
0 so that it's
specially localized.

1414
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,000
So can you build a
normalizable state

1415
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,450
with energy 0, which is an
eigenfunction of the energy 0?

1416
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,020
No, not in this case either.

1417
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,500
So there's the
technical complaint

1418
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,550
that you need to talk about
what you mean relative to what.

1419
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,758
That was about your question.

1420
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:48,182
And the second of, can you
ever have an energy eigenstate

1421
01:06:48,182 --> 01:06:49,890
which is at the minimum
of the potential?

1422
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:50,750
And that's also 0.

1423
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,710
That's also no.

1424
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,890
You'll actually prove that
on a later problem set.

1425
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:58,990
So with all that
said, we have a mere--

1426
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,890
that's awesome-- 15 minutes
for a 14-page lecture.

1427
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,090
So can I do this fast?

1428
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,972
No, I'm kidding.

1429
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:06,930
I won't do that to you.

1430
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,140
So I want to just-- instead
of going through it.

1431
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,660
So this was not directly
relevant for the exam.

1432
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:16,820
And this can come
a little bit later.

1433
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:21,510
So let me show you a
couple of quick things.

1434
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,139
So the notes are posted online.

1435
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:23,680
Look at them.

1436
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,560
I'll go over them
again in the future.

1437
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,480
What do I want to do?

1438
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,570
So I want to introduce
to you two ideas.

1439
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,230
One is Dirac notation.

1440
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:37,330
And this is hearkening back
to basics of vector spaces.

1441
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,400
And the second is,
I want to tell you

1442
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,395
something about what
the commutator means.

1443
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:44,270
So first off, let me
ask you guys a question.

1444
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,900

1445
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,608
I have one more clicker
question for you.

1446
01:07:50,608 --> 01:08:11,524

1447
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:13,755
All right, are you all ready?

1448
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:17,300

1449
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,211
Everyone up with the clickers?

1450
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:21,169
Here's is the question.

1451
01:08:21,169 --> 01:08:28,703

1452
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:31,830
[MUSIC PLAYING - JEOPARDY THEME]

1453
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:41,994

1454
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:43,530
OK, go ahead and
start clicking now.

1455
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:50,810

1456
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,810
Sigma's the uncertainty.

1457
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,260
Sorry, sigma is the uncertainty.

1458
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:58,184

1459
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:58,850
This is awesome.

1460
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:03,470
I swear the clicks are going
in beat with the music.

1461
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,200
So let me give you
three more seconds.

1462
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,760
1-2-3.

1463
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,100
This is awesome.

1464
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,960
You guys are totally at chance.

1465
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,370
You have even probability
distribution across the three.

1466
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,203
So this is good, because
we haven't actually

1467
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:18,649
introduced this idea yet in 804.

1468
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:22,100
So let me quickly
talk you through this.

1469
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,479
So I'll leave it off.

1470
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:27,170
So let me quickly
talk you through this.

1471
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,086
And this is important.

1472
01:09:28,086 --> 01:09:31,380
This is going to give you some
intuition for what uncertainty

1473
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:31,880
means.

1474
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,450
And it's also going to give
you some intuition for what

1475
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,627
the commutator means.

1476
01:09:35,627 --> 01:09:37,710
So this is a little more
experience, a little more

1477
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,580
practice with operators.

1478
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,010
And we'll pick up on the
Dirac notation and everything

1479
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:42,510
next time.

1480
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:45,450
Because I just want to
get through this physics.

1481
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:49,200
So consider two operators,
A and B. So A and B

1482
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,810
are my two operators.

1483
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:52,469
They have hats.

1484
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:54,975

1485
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:58,120
He has a top hot.

1486
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,407
So we have-- you've got to
make this stuff a little more

1487
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:01,990
light hearted.

1488
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:07,240
So we have two operators,
A and B. And I want to ask,

1489
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:12,170
is it possible for there to be
a function phi little a little

1490
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:16,240
b which is simultaneously
an eigenfunction of a

1491
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,480
and an eigenfunction of b?

1492
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,310
So now this is a
pure math question.

1493
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:23,500
Given two operators,
a and b, can you

1494
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,250
build a function which
is simultaneously

1495
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,520
an eigenfunction of a and
an eigenfunction of b?

1496
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,370
I will call this phi sub ab.

1497
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:31,870
Why not?

1498
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,800
OK, phi sub ab
has this property.

1499
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,460
And phi ab is equal to little a.

1500
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,460
Why not?

1501
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,020
And b on phi ab is equal
to little b on phi ab.

1502
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,140
You can't stop me, I have
now created this object.

1503
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,150
From the existence
of this state,

1504
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:51,007
what can you deduce about
the operators a and b?

1505
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:53,340
And if you've already seen
this before, that's cheating.

1506
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,260
So don't raise your hand.

1507
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,634
But if you haven't seen it
before, just think through it.

1508
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:59,214
What does this tell you
about the operators a and b?

1509
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:00,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1510
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:04,462

1511
01:11:04,462 --> 01:11:05,170
PROFESSOR: Great.

1512
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:05,730
That's a nice guess.

1513
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:06,710
I like that guess.

1514
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,600
So let's check.

1515
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,970
So what would it mean for the
commutator of a and b to be 0?

1516
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:17,625
So this is equal to ab minus ba.

1517
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,900
And what the commutator does
is it takes two operators

1518
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,280
and it gives you a new
operator called bracket ab.

1519
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:30,050
And sometimes it's useful to
call it c, for commutator.

1520
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,650
So it gives you a new operator.

1521
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,630
Given two operators you
build a new operator.

1522
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,280

1523
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,600
And suppose now that we
have a common eigenfunction

1524
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,270
of a and b.

1525
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,270
What does that tell you?

1526
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:47,920
Well, let's take the
commutator-- a, b--

1527
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,380
and let's take it and
act on phi of sub ab

1528
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,839
on this common eigenstate.

1529
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:52,880
So what is this equal to?

1530
01:11:52,880 --> 01:12:00,060
This is equal to ab
minus ba phi b, which

1531
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:06,550
I can write as ab phi
ab minus ba phi ab

1532
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:11,020
by linearity-- by
addition, really.

1533
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:15,390
But b acting on phi ab gives
me, by hypothesis, little b.

1534
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,630

1535
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,650
And then a acting on a
constant times phi ab

1536
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:26,060
gives me a little a times
that constant minus-- now

1537
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,370
here a acting on phi ab
gives me little a phi ab.

1538
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:34,190
And then b acting on constant
times phi ab gives me little b.

1539
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:35,750
And now I can join
these together.

1540
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:43,030
This is equal to little
ab minus ba phi ab.

1541
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:48,300

1542
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,460
But little a and
little b are numbers.

1543
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,380
If you take 7 times 5 and 5
times 7 and you subtract them,

1544
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,230
what do you get?

1545
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,210
0.

1546
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:03,887
So in order for a and b to share
a single eigenfunction phi ab,

1547
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:05,470
what must be true
of their commutator?

1548
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,390

1549
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,990
It must have an a
non-zero kernel, exactly.

1550
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:15,400
The commutator must annihilate
that particular common

1551
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,940
eigenfunction.

1552
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,380
Does it tell you that
it kills every function?

1553
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,000
No.

1554
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,570
But it must at the very
least annihilate the shared

1555
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:25,375
eigenfunction.

1556
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:25,875
True?

1557
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,920

1558
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:35,490
Consider two operators
of the following form.

1559
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:40,370
Consider two operators
who commutator ab

1560
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,245
is equal to the identity
times a constant.

1561
01:13:43,245 --> 01:13:47,800

1562
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,650
Do these operators share
any common eigenfunctions?

1563
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:56,090
They can't, because the
commutator-- the identity--

1564
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:58,980
doesn't annihilate
any wave functions.

1565
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,130
Any functions.

1566
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:02,510
Nothing is 0 when acted
upon by the identity.

1567
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,490
That's the definition
of the identity.

1568
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:11,290
The identity takes any function,
gives it that function back.

1569
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,920
Cool?

1570
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:16,050
Do a and b share any
common eigenfunctions?

1571
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:22,010
Now let's think about what that
means in terms of observables.

1572
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:25,700
Observables are
represented by operators.

1573
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,614
What is the meaning
of the eigenfunctions

1574
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:29,405
of those operators?

1575
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:34,560

1576
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,510
AUDIENCE: It corresponds
to the [INAUDIBLE].

1577
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:39,070
PROFESSOR: It
corresponds to the state

1578
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:41,580
with a definite value
of that observable.

1579
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:46,040
And the value is the
corresponding eigenvalue.

1580
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,570
So the eigenfunction of
an observable operator

1581
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,882
is a possible state
with a definite value

1582
01:14:51,882 --> 01:14:52,590
of that operator.

1583
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,756
If I tell you that I have
a state which is an energy

1584
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,280
eigenfunction,
then that means it

1585
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,420
is a state with a definite
value of the energy.

1586
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,510
If I measure that energy, I
know exactly what I will get.

1587
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,240
Cool?

1588
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,560
If a and b are two observables
and their commutator

1589
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,510
is proportional to the
identity, is it possible

1590
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,690
that there is a state
with a definite value

1591
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:18,140
of a and a definite value
of b simultaneously?

1592
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,060
No, because a state with
a definite value of a

1593
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,351
would be an eigenfunction of a.

1594
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:22,970
And a state with a
definite value of b

1595
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:24,470
would be an eigenfunction of b.

1596
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:28,410
And there are no common states,
no common eigenfunctions

1597
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:33,590
of a and b because the
commutator never kills a state.

1598
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:34,420
It has no 0's.

1599
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:38,280

1600
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,571
What is the
commutator of x and p?

1601
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:44,500

1602
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,510
Commit this to memory, i h bar.

1603
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,384
Now when we write i h bar,
this is not really an operator.

1604
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:50,050
That's a number.

1605
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,300
What's the operator?

1606
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,410
The identity.

1607
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:56,910
Are there any states which are
simultaneously eigenfunctions

1608
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:00,386
of x-- the operator x--
and eigenfunctions of p?

1609
01:16:00,386 --> 01:16:02,990
Are there any states that
have a definite position

1610
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,370
and a definite momentum
simultaneously?

1611
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,390
Is that because we're ignorant?

1612
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,700
Are we ignorant?

1613
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,660
Yes, OK good.

1614
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,140
So it is because
the kinds of things

1615
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:19,160
that position [INAUDIBLE] r
forbid the existence of a state

1616
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,690
with a definite value of x
and with a definite value of p

1617
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,000
simultaneously.

1618
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,430
It is neither here, nor
there, nor both, nor neither.

1619
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:31,060

1620
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,750
So this tells us
something very lovely.

1621
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,400
This tells us that if we're in
a state with a definite value

1622
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,970
of x, what must be true of our
uncertainty in the value of p?

1623
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:45,887
It can't be 0, because if our
uncertainty in the knowledge p

1624
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:47,970
were 0, that would mean
we were in a p eigenstate.

1625
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,980
We would have
definite value of p.

1626
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,639
So if a delta x is 0, delta
p cannot be 0 for sure.

1627
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:54,930
Now how big does it have to be?

1628
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,416
Could it be arbitrarily small?

1629
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:58,790
So here's a
commutation relation.

1630
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,600
You will prove the
following relation

1631
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,529
later on in the course.

1632
01:17:02,529 --> 01:17:04,070
But I want to tell
you now, because I

1633
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,528
want to give you some intuition
for what the commutator is.

1634
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:07,320
What it means.

1635
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,870
What the physics of it is.

1636
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:13,016
If I take two
operators, a and b,

1637
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:15,140
which have a commutator--
which is a constant times

1638
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:20,320
the identity-- then the
uncertainty in any state

1639
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:29,700
psi of a times the uncertainty
in the same state psi of b

1640
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:36,530
must be greater than or equal
to 1/2 the absolute value

1641
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,210
of the expectation value
of the commutator-- that's

1642
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,600
an amazing set of
symbols-- of a with b.

1643
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:51,990

1644
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,856
Square root.

1645
01:17:52,856 --> 01:17:54,730
AUDIENCE: You've got yo
take the square root.

1646
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,106
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

1647
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:57,860
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was kidding.

1648
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,367
PROFESSOR: So the easier
way to-- let's see a,b.

1649
01:18:00,367 --> 01:18:02,200
Let's just make sure
I'm getting this right.

1650
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,449
I'm the commutator of a and b.

1651
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:06,190

1652
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,690
Oh no, no.

1653
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:07,648
There's no square root.

1654
01:18:07,648 --> 01:18:08,200
Sorry.

1655
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,366
Why are you messing with me?

1656
01:18:09,366 --> 01:18:13,720

1657
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,260
Expectation value of a and b.

1658
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,770
Delta a.

1659
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:18,540
Delta p.

1660
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,890
H bar.

1661
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:21,640
Yes, good.

1662
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,650
So in particular, these
expectation values

1663
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,720
should be taken
with the state psi.

1664
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,084
Sorry, it's late and I'm tired.

1665
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:30,750
And this should be
taken into state psi.

1666
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:35,470

1667
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:37,080
So we compute the commutator.

1668
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,290
We take the expectation
value in our state.

1669
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:42,510
We take the norm,
multiply it by 1/2,

1670
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,960
and this is the bound
This is the claim.

1671
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,310
So let's check this in
the case of x and p.

1672
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:49,940
And do I have this
using just math?

1673
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,810
This will come from
just linear algebra.

1674
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:57,699

1675
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,490
So let's check this in
the case of x and p.

1676
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:02,790
What's the commutator?

1677
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,560
1.

1678
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,160
So what's the expectation
value in a state, psi,

1679
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:13,230
of i h bar times operator 1 psi?

1680
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:15,011
It's i h bar.

1681
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:15,510
Great.

1682
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:16,593
So what happens over here?

1683
01:19:16,593 --> 01:19:20,010
What do we get for delta x
in the state psi times delta

1684
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,350
p in the state psi?

1685
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:24,080

1686
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,470
This must be greater than
or equal to 1/2 times

1687
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,810
the absolute value
of the expectation

1688
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:30,810
value of the commutator.

1689
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,580
But the expectation value of
the commutator is i h bar.

1690
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,960
And the norm of
that is just h bar.

1691
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,150

1692
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,670
This is the
uncertainty relation.

1693
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,464
So given some
uncertainty in delta x,

1694
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:45,880
this tells us how
much delta p is.

1695
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,296
Now, how does this
right hand side

1696
01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:49,970
depend on the wave function psi?

1697
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,810
It turns out it doesn't.

1698
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:54,200
It's explicitly independent
of the particular wave

1699
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,408
function we're interested in.

1700
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:58,642
For any wave
function whatsoever,

1701
01:19:58,642 --> 01:20:00,600
the uncertainty in x
times the uncertainty in p

1702
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,776
must be greater than
or equal to 1/2 h bar.

1703
01:20:03,776 --> 01:20:05,650
And this is a consequence
of the commutation,

1704
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,710
and more importantly,
the failure

1705
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:12,070
of x and p to commute, because
the ability to commute and get

1706
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:16,520
0 is necessary for there
to be common eigenstates.

1707
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,350
Now imagine in this case a and
b are that a and b that in fact

1708
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:22,180
do share a common eigenstate.

1709
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:27,050
So let's compute the uncertainty
of a in the state phi sub

1710
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:37,230
ab, phi sub ab, phi
sub ab, phi sub ab.

1711
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,580
And what is this equal to?

1712
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,490
Well, what's the commutator
acting on the state phi sub ab?

1713
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:43,170
0.

1714
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,790
So this is greater
than or equal to 0.

1715
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:47,834
And in fact, you can
just check by going

1716
01:20:47,834 --> 01:20:50,000
through the proof of this
that it's just equal to 0.

1717
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,020
So what's the uncertainty of a?

1718
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,020
Well, we know it's in the
state with definite value of a.

1719
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,600
0.

1720
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,651
Uncertainty in b in this
state, what's the uncertainty?

1721
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:57,150
0.

1722
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,300
We know that it's in
an eigenstate of b.

1723
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:01,850
So 0 is indeed greater
than or equal to 0,

1724
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:04,810
so it satisfies the
uncertainty relation.

1725
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:08,060
Commuting is telling you about
the possibility of the state

1726
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,400
having definite values of
both operators simultaneously.

1727
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,010
And this is going to turn out
to be enormously valuable when

1728
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:15,551
we talk about angular
momentum, which

1729
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:16,850
is coming in a couple of weeks.

1730
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:20,340
OK, see you guys on Thursday
here for the midterm.

1731
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:31,746
