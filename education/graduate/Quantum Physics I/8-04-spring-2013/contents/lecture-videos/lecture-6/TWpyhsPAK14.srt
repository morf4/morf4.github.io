00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,590

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,720
PROFESSOR: So,
finally, before I get

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,230
started on the new
stuff, questions

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,500
from the previous lectures?

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,820

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,052
No questions?

15
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:37,552
Yeah.

16
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:38,025
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

17
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,483
You might have said
this last time,

18
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:41,069
but when is the first exam?

19
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,110
PROFESSOR: Ah, excellent.

20
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,150
Those will be posted on the
Stellar page later today.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,221
Yeah.

22
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,145
AUDIENCE: OK, so we're
associating operators

23
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,444
with observables, right?

24
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:52,069
PROFESSOR: Yes.

25
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,568
AUDIENCE: And
Professor [? Zugoff ?]

26
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,676
mentioned that whenever
we have done a wave

27
00:00:55,676 --> 00:01:00,082
function with an
operator, it collapses.

28
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:02,040
PROFESSOR: OK, so let me
rephrase the question.

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,640
This is a very valuable
question to talk through.

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,720
So, thanks for asking it.

31
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,486
So, we've previously observed
that observables are associated

32
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,860
with operators--
and we'll review

33
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,930
that in more detail
in a second--

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,100
and the statement was
then made, does that

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,210
mean that acting on a wave
function with an operator

36
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,660
is like measuring
the observable?

37
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,540
And it's absolutely
essential that you understand

38
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,960
that acting on a wave
function with an operator

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,380
has nothing whatsoever to do
with measuring that associated

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,240
observable.

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
Nothing.

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,860
OK?

43
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,895
And we'll talk about
the relationship

44
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:39,160
and what those things mean.

45
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,400
But here's a very
tempting thing to think.

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,540
I have a wave function.

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,890
I want to know the momentum.

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,160
I will thus operate with
the momentum operator.

49
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,400
Completely wrong.

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,430
So, before I even tell you
what the right statement is,

51
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,030
let me just get that
out of your head,

52
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,384
and then we'll talk through
that in much more detail

53
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,300
over the next lecture.

54
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,970
Yeah.

55
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,395
AUDIENCE: Why doesn't it
collapse by special relativity?

56
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:59,770
PROFESSOR: We're
doing everything

57
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,730
non-relativistically.

58
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,620
Quantum Mechanics
for 804 is going

59
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,600
to be a universe in which
there is no relativity.

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,530
If you ask me that more
precisely in my office hours,

61
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,970
I will tell you a
relativistic story.

62
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,130
But it doesn't violate
anything relativistic.

63
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,700
At all.

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,690
We'll talk about that-- just
to be a little more detailed--

65
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,380
that will be a very
important question that we'll

66
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,140
deal with in the last two
lectures of the course,

67
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,894
when we come back to Bell's
inequality and locality.

68
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,560
Other questions?

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,580

70
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,844
OK.

71
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:32,760
So, let's get started.

72
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,010
So, just to review where we are.

73
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,292
In Quantum Mechanics
according to 804,

74
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,500
our first pass at the
definition of quantum mechanics

75
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,290
is that the configuration of
any system-- and in particular,

76
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,206
think about a single
point particle--

77
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,580
the configuration
of our particle

78
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,696
is specified by giving
a wave function, which

79
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,320
is a function which
may depend on time,

80
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,445
but a function of position.

81
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:55,310

82
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,956
Observables-- and this is
a complete specification

83
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,080
of the state of the system.

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,540
If I know the wave
function, I neither

85
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,140
needed nor have access to
any further information

86
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,870
about the system.

87
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,650
All the information specifying
the configuration system

88
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,420
is completely contained
in the wave function.

89
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,090
Secondly, observables
in quantum mechanics

90
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,840
are associated with operators.

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,750
Something you can
build an experiment

92
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,920
to observe or to measure is
associated with an operator.

93
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,990
And by an operator, I
mean a rule or a map,

94
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,170
something that tells you
if you give me a function,

95
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,091
I will give you a
different function back.

96
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:32,590
OK?

97
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,631
An operator is just a
thing which eats a function

98
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,280
and spits out another function.

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
Now, operators-- which I
will denote with a hat,

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,730
as long as I can remember
to do so-- operators

101
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,230
come-- and in particular, the
kinds of operators we're going

102
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,521
to care about, linear operators,
which you talked about

103
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,300
in detail last lecture--
linear operators come endowed

104
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,220
with a natural set
of special functions

105
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,930
called Eigenfunctions with
the following property.

106
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,930
Your operator, acting
on its Eigenfunction,

107
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,030
gives you that same function
back times a constant.

108
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,920

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,395
So, that's a very
special generically.

110
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,270
An operator will take
a function and give you

111
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,630
some other random
function that doesn't

112
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,200
look all like the
original function.

113
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,491
It's a very special thing to
give you the same function

114
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,180
back times a constant.

115
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,070
So, a useful thing
to think about here

116
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,940
is just in the case
of vector spaces.

117
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,730
So, I'm going to consider
the operation corresponding

118
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,210
to rotation around the
z-axis by a small angle.

119
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,130
OK?

120
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,810
So, under rotation around
the z-axis by a small angle,

121
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,287
I take an arbitrary vector
to some other stupid vector.

122
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,370
Which vector is completely
determined by the rule?

123
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,970
I rotate by a small
amount, right?

124
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,110
I take this vector and
it gives me this one.

125
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,750
I take that vector,
it gives me this one.

126
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,970
Everyone agree with that?

127
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,350
What are the Eigenvectors
of the rotation

128
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,006
by a small angle
around the z-axis?

129
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:53,470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

130
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,520
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
got to be a vector that

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
doesn't change its direction.

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
It just changes by magnitude.

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,660
So there's one, right?

134
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,270
I rotate.

135
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,897
And what's its Eigenvalue?

136
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:03,480
AUDIENCE: One.

137
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,490
PROFESSOR: One, because
nothing changed, right?

138
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,480
Now, let's consider the
following operation.

139
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
Rotate by small angle
and double its length.

140
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,020
OK, that's a different operator.

141
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,430
I rotate and I
double the length.

142
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,550
I rotate and I
double the length.

143
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,930
I rotate and I
double the length.

144
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,360
Yeah, so what's the Eigenvalue
under that operator?

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,185
AUDIENCE: Two.

146
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:21,810
PROFESSOR: Two.

147
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,650
Right, exactly.

148
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,482
So these are a very
special set of functions.

149
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,690
This is the same idea, but
instead of having vectors,

150
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,340
we have functions.

151
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,722
Questions?

152
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:32,580
I thought I saw a hand pop up.

153
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,080
No?

154
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,800
OK, cool.

155
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,580
Third, superposition.

156
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,620
Given any two viable
wave functions

157
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,120
that could describe
our system, that

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,620
could specify states or
configurations of our system,

159
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,130
an arbitrary superposition of
them-- arbitrary linear sum--

160
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,900
could also be a valid
physical configuration.

161
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,172
There is also a
state corresponding

162
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,380
to being in an arbitrary sum.

163
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,230
For example, if we know that
the electron could be black

164
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,980
and it could be
white, it could also

165
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,810
be in an arbitrary superposition
of being black and white.

166
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,975
And that is a statement in
which the electron is not black.

167
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,490
The electron is not white.

168
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,530
It is in the
superposition of the two.

169
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,040
It does not have
a definite color.

170
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,680
And that is exactly
the configuration

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,740
we found inside our apparatus
in the first lecture.

172
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah.

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,420
AUDIENCE: Are those Phi-A
arbitrary functions,

174
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,170
or are they supposed
to be Eigenfunctions?

175
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,670
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

176
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,600
So, in general the
superposition thank you.

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,725
It's an excellent question.

178
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,082
The question was are these
Phi-As arbitrary functions,

179
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,540
or are they specific
Eigenfunctions

180
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,704
of some operator?

181
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,370
So, the superposition
principle actually

182
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,453
says a very general thing.

183
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:39,860
It says, given any two
viable wave functions,

184
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,630
an arbitrary sum, an
arbitrary linear combination,

185
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,962
is also a viable wave function.

186
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,170
But here I want to mark
something slightly different.

187
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,220
And this is why I chose
the notation I did.

188
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,310
Given an operator
A, it comes endowed

189
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,870
with a special set of functions,
its Eigenfunctions, right?

190
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,410
We saw the last time.

191
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,480
And I claimed the following.

192
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,050
Beyond just the usual
superposition principle,

193
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,670
the set of Eigenfunctions
of operators

194
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,810
corresponding to physical
observables-- so, pick

195
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,460
your observable, like momentum.

196
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,050
That corresponds to an operator.

197
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,632
Consider the
Eigenfunctions of momentum.

198
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:15,840
Those we know what those are.

199
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,970
They're plane waves with
definite wavelength,

200
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,803
right? u to the ikx.

201
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,678

202
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:25,240
Any function can be
expressed as a superposition

203
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,170
of those Eigenfunctions of
your physical observable.

204
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,280
We'll go over this in
more detail in a minute.

205
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,880
But here I want to emphasize
that the Eigenfunctions have

206
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,461
a special property that-- for
observables, for operators

207
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:40,710
corresponding to observables--
the Eigenfunctions form

208
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,160
a basis.

209
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,320
Any function can be expanded
as some linear combination

210
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,660
of these basis functions,
the classic example

211
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,070
being the Fourier expansion.

212
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,370
Any function, any
periodic function,

213
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,890
can be expanded as a sum
of sines and cosines,

214
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,850
and any function
on the real line

215
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,010
can be expanded as a sum of
exponentials, e to the ikx.

216
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,210
This is the same statement.

217
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,270
The Eigenfunctions
of momentum are what?

218
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,230
e to the ikx.

219
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,320
So, this is the same that
an arbitrary function--

220
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,304
when the observable
is the momentum,

221
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,470
this is the statement that
an arbitrary function can

222
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,550
be expanded as a superposition,
or a sum of exponentials,

223
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,480
and that's the Fourier theorem.

224
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
Cool?

225
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,806
Was there a question?

226
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:22,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

227
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,920
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

228
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,890
Other questions on these points?

229
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,800
So, these should not yet be
trivial and obvious to you.

230
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,690
If they are, then that's
great, but if they're not,

231
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,440
we're going to be
working through examples

232
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,289
for the next several
lectures and problem sets.

233
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,010
The point now is to give you
a grounding on which to stand.

234
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,250
Fourth postulate.

235
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,524
What these expansion
coefficients mean.

236
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:48,940
And this is also
an interpretation

237
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,439
of the meaning of
the wave function.

238
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,050
What these expansion
coefficients mean

239
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,550
is that the probability that
I measure the observable

240
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,810
to be a particular Eigenvalue
is the norm squared

241
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,635
of the expansion coefficient.

242
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:01,910
OK?

243
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,510
So, I tell you that
any function can

244
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,360
be expanded as a superposition
of plane waves-- waves

245
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,082
with definite momentum--
with some coefficients.

246
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,040
And those coefficients
depend on which function

247
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,210
I'm talking about.

248
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,442
What these coefficients
tell me is the probability

249
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,650
that I will measure the
momentum to be the associated

250
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,655
value, the Eigenvalue.

251
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:19,290
OK?

252
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,164
Take that coefficient,
take its norm squared,

253
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,790
that gives me the probability.

254
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,902
How do we compute these
expansion coefficients?

255
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:29,110
I think Barton didn't
introduce to you this notation,

256
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,402
but he certainly told you this.

257
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,943
So let me introduce to you this
notation which I particularly

258
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:33,780
like.

259
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,460
We can extract the
expansion coefficient

260
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,030
if we know the wave function
by taking this integral,

261
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,690
taking the wave
function, multiplying

262
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,859
by the complex conjugate of
the associated Eigenfunction,

263
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:47,650
doing the integral.

264
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,630
And that notation is this
round brackets with Phi A

265
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,880
and Psi is my notation
for this integral.

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,390

267
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,200
And again, we'll still see
this in more detail later on.

268
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,650
And finally we have
collapse, the statement that,

269
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,630
if we go about measuring
some observable A,

270
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,100
then we will always, always
observe precisely one

271
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,140
of the Eigenvalues
of that operator.

272
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,360
We will never measure
anything else.

273
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,110
If the Eigenvalues are one,
two, three, four, and five,

274
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,380
you will never measure
half, 13 halves.

275
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,280
You will always
measure an Eigenvalue.

276
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,060
And upon measuring
that Eigenvalue,

277
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,720
you can be confident that that's
the actual value of the system.

278
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,180
I observe that it's
a white electron,

279
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,950
then it will remain white if I
subsequently measure its color.

280
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,230
What that's telling you is
it's no longer a superposition

281
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,570
of white and black,
but it's wave function

282
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,800
is that corresponding
to a definite value

283
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,790
of the observable.

284
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,090
So, somehow the process
of measurement-- and this

285
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,740
is a disturbing statement, to
which we'll return-- somehow

286
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,780
the process of measuring
the observable changes

287
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,980
the wave function from our
arbitrary superposition

288
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,937
to a specific Eigenfunction,
one particular Eigenfunction

289
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:08,270
of the operator we're measuring.

290
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,972

291
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:13,180
And this is called the
collapse of the wave function.

292
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,060
It collapses from
being a superposition

293
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,050
over possible states to
being in a definite state

294
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,900
upon measurement.

295
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,680
And the definite
state is that state

296
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,020
corresponding to the value
we observed or measured.

297
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,727
Yeah.

298
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,685
AUDIENCE: So, when the
wave function collapses,

299
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,790
does it instantaneously not
become a function of time

300
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,290
anymore?

301
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,510
Because originally
we had Psi of (x,t).

302
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,468
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

303
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:38,234
So I wrote this only
in terms of position,

304
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,650
but I should more
precisely write.

305
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,390
So, the question was, does this
happen instantaneously, or more

306
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,250
precisely, does it cease
to be a function of time?

307
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,750
Thank you.

308
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
It's very good question.

309
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,833
So, no, it doesn't cease
to be a function of time.

310
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,460
It just says that
Psi at x-- what

311
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,960
you know upon doing
this measurement

312
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,360
is that Psi, as a function
of x, at the time which I'll

313
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,460
call T star, at what
you've done the measurement

314
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,067
is equal to this wave function.

315
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,400
And so that leaves us with
the following question, which

316
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,608
is another way of asking
the question you just asked.

317
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:05,810
What happens next?

318
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,550
How does the system
evolve subsequently?

319
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,450
And at the very end
of the last lecture,

320
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,720
we answered that--
or rather, Barton

321
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,850
answered that-- by introducing
the Schrodinger equation.

322
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,760
And the Schrodinger equation,
we don't derive, we just posit.

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,650
Much like Newton
posits f equals ma.

324
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,110
You can motivate it,
but you can't derive it.

325
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,900
It's just what we mean by
the quantum mechanical model.

326
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,550
And Schrodinger's equation
says, given a wave function,

327
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,510
I can determine the time
derivative, the time

328
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,530
rate of changes of
that wave function,

329
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,950
and determine its
time evolution,

330
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,070
and its time derivative,
its slope-- its velocity,

331
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,090
if you will-- is one upon I h
bar, the energy operator acting

332
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,460
on that wave function.

333
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,090
So, suppose we measure
that our observable capital

334
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,580
A takes the value
of little a, one

335
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,870
of the Eigenvalues of
the associated operators.

336
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,550
Suppose we measure
that A equals little a

337
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,602
at some particular
moment T start.

338
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:02,060
Then we know that
the wave function

339
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,735
is Psi of x at that
moment in time.

340
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,360
We can then compute
the time derivative

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,151
of the wave function
at that moment in time

342
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:11,150
by acting on this wave
function with the operator e

343
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,690
hat, the energy operator.

344
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,190
And we can then integrate that
differential equation forward

345
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,100
in time and determine how
the wave function evolves.

346
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,370
The point of today's
lecture is going

347
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,980
to be to study how time
evolution works in quantum

348
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,950
mechanics, and to look
at some basic examples

349
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,060
and basic strategies for
solving the time evolution

350
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,540
problem in quantum mechanics.

351
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,590
One of the great surprises
in quantum mechanics--

352
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,048
hold on just one sec-- one of
the real surprises in quantum

353
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,770
mechanics is that
time evolution is

354
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,070
in a very specific sense
trivial in quantum mechanics.

355
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,680
It's preposterously simple.

356
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,010
In particular, time evolution is
governed by a linear equation.

357
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,760
How many of you have studied
a classical mechanical system

358
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,181
where the time evolution is
governed by a linear equation?

359
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:57,680
Right.

360
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,305
OK, all of you.

361
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,740
The harmonic oscillator.

362
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,600
But otherwise, not at all.

363
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,890
Otherwise, the equations
in classical mechanics

364
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,860
are generically
highly nonlinear.

365
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,762
The time rate of change
of position of a particle

366
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,095
is the gradient of the force,
and the force is generally

367
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,940
some complicated
function of position.

368
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,050
You've got some capacitors
over here, and maybe

369
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,980
some magnetic field.

370
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,062
It's very nonlinear.

371
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,770
Evolution in quantum
mechanics is linear,

372
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,921
and this is going
to be surprising.

373
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:24,170
It's going to lead to some
surprising simplifications.

374
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,350
And we'll turn
back to that, but I

375
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,319
want to put that your
mind like a little hook,

376
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:28,860
that that's something
you should mark

377
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,724
on to as different from
classical mechanics.

378
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:31,890
And we'll come back to that.

379
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,380
Yeah.

380
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,005
AUDIENCE: If a particle
is continuously

381
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,600
observed as a not
evolving particle?

382
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,183
PROFESSOR: That's
an awesome question.

383
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,780
The question is, look,
imagine I observe--

384
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,030
I'm going to paraphrase--
imagine I observe a particle

385
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,320
and I observe that it's here.

386
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,820
OK?

387
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,710
Subsequently, its wave function
will evolve in some way--

388
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,995
and we'll actually study that
later today-- its wave function

389
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,780
will evolve in some
way, and it'll change.

390
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,780
It won't necessarily be
definitely here anymore.

391
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,640
But if I just keep measuring it
over and over and over again,

392
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,348
I just keep measure
it to be right there.

393
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,290
It can't possibly evolve.

394
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,180
And that's actually
true, and it's

395
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,210
called the Quantum Zeno problem.

396
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,660
So, it's the observation
that if you continuously

397
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,480
measure a thing,
you can't possibly

398
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,200
have its wave function
evolve significantly.

399
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,780
And not only is it a cute
idea, but it's something people

400
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,340
do in the laboratory.

401
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,850
So, Martin-- well, OK.

402
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,040
People do it in a
laboratory and it's cool.

403
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
Come ask me and I'll tell
you about the experiments.

404
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,580
Other questions?

405
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,040
There were a bunch.

406
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,450
Yeah.

407
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,334
AUDIENCE: So after you measure,
the Schrodinger equation

408
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:24,540
also gives you the
evolution backwards in time?

409
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,810
PROFESSOR: Oh, crap!

410
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,390
Yes.

411
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,590
That's such a good question.

412
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,160
OK.

413
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,670
I hate it when people
ask that at this point,

414
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,211
because I had to
then say more words.

415
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:32,920
That's a very good question.

416
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,390
So the question goes like this.

417
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,300
So this was going to be a
punchline later on in the

418
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,910
in the lecture but you stole
my thunder, so that's awesome.

419
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,520
So, here's the deal.

420
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,960
We have a rule for time
evolution of a wave function,

421
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,840
and it has some
lovely properties.

422
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,550
In particular-- let me talk
through this-- in particular,

423
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,167
this equation is linear.

424
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,500
So what properties does it have?

425
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,680
Let me just-- I'm
going to come back

426
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
to your question
in just a second,

427
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,280
but first I want to set it up
so we have a little more meat

428
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,460
to answer your
question precisely.

429
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,730
So we note some properties
of this equation, this time

430
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,860
evolution equation.

431
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,330
The first is that it's
a linear equation.

432
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,660
The derivative of
a sum of function

433
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,224
is a sum of the derivatives.

434
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,890
The energy operator's
a linear operator,

435
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,370
meaning the energy operator
acting on a sum of functions

436
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,370
is a sum of the energy operator
acting on each function.

437
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,620
You guys studied linear
operators in your problem set,

438
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,786
right?

439
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:30,660
So, these are linear.

440
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,780
What that tells you
is if Psi 1 of x and t

441
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,580
solves the Schrodinger equation,
and Psi 2 of x and t-- two

442
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,870
different functions of
position in time-- both

443
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,000
solve the Schrodinger equation,
then any combination of them--

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,630
alpha Psi 1 plus Beta Psi 2--
also solves-- which I will call

445
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,130
Psi, and I'll make it
a capital Psi for fun--

446
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,040
solves the Schrodinger
equation automatically.

447
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,329
Given two solutions of
the Schrodinger equation,

448
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,579
a superposition of them--
an arbitrary superposition--

449
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,660
also solves the
Schrodinger equation.

450
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,390
This is linearity.

451
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,500
Cool?

452
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,450
Next property.

453
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,869
It's unitary.

454
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,800
What I mean by unitary is this.

455
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,089
It concerns probability.

456
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,579
And you'll give a
precise derivation

457
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,859
of what I mean by
unitary and you'll

458
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,859
demonstrate that, in fact,
Schrodinger evolution

459
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,075
is unitary on your
next problem set.

460
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,570
It's not on the current one.

461
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,995
But what I mean by unitary is
that conserves probability.

462
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,160
Whoops, that's an o.

463
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,120
Conserves probability.

464
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,180
IE, if there's an
electron here, or if we

465
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,910
have an object, a
piece of chalk-- which

466
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,365
I'm treating as a quantum
mechanical point particle--

467
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,430
it's described by
the wave function.

468
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,530
The integral, the probability
distribution over all the

469
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,550
places it could possibly
be had better be one,

470
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,410
because it had better be
somewhere with probability one.

471
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,230
That had better
not change in time.

472
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,705
If I solve the Schrodinger
equation evolve the system

473
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,007
forward for half an
hour, it had better not

474
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,590
be the case that the
total probability

475
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,610
of finding the
particle is one half.

476
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,570
That means things
disappear in the universe.

477
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,240
And much as my socks
would seem to be

478
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,690
a counter example of that,
things don't disappear, right?

479
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,020
It just doesn't happen.

480
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,180
So, quantum mechanics
is demonstrably-- well,

481
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,330
quantum mechanics
is unitary, and this

482
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,050
is a demonstrably good
description of the real world.

483
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,750
It fits all the observations
we've ever made.

484
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,050
No one's ever discovered
an experimental violation

485
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,850
of unitarity of
quantum mechanics.

486
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,490
I will note that there is
a theoretical violation

487
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,710
of unitarity in quantum
mechanics, which

488
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,750
is dear to my heart.

489
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,670
It's called the Hawking Effect,
and it's an observation that,

490
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,520
due quantum mechanics, black
holes in general relativity--

491
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,520
places from which light
cannot escape-- evaporate.

492
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,500
So you throw stuff and
you form a black hole.

493
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,310
It's got a horizon.

494
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,684
If you fall through
that horizon,

495
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:57,730
we never see you again.

496
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,290
Surprisingly, a black hole's
a hot object like an iron,

497
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,667
and it sends off radiation.

498
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,750
As it sends off radiation,
it's losing its energy.

499
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,760
It's shrinking.

500
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
And eventually it will,
like the classical atom,

501
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,160
collapse to nothing.

502
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,660
There's a quibble
going on right now

503
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,040
over whether it really
collapses to nothing,

504
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,655
or whether there's
a little granule

505
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,577
nugget of quantum goodness.

506
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:16,710
[LAUGHTER]

507
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,220
We argue about this.

508
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,930
We get paid to argue about this.

509
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,430
[LAUGHTER]

510
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,440
So, but here's the funny thing.

511
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,107
If you threw in a dictionary and
then the black hole evaporates,

512
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:28,440
where did the information
about what made the black hole

513
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,660
go if it's just thermal
radiation coming out?

514
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,480
So, this is a
classic calculation,

515
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,350
which to a theorist says, ah ha!

516
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,810
Maybe unitarity isn't conserved.

517
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,960
But, look.

518
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,610
Black holes, theorists.

519
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,680
There's no
experimental violation

520
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,420
of unitarity anywhere.

521
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,390
And if anyone ever did
find such a violation,

522
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,210
it would shatter the basic
tenets of quantum mechanics,

523
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,450
in particular the
Schrodinger equation.

524
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,925
So that's something we would
love to see but never have.

525
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,300
It depends on your
point of view.

526
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,469
You might hate to see it.

527
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,010
And the third-- and
this is, I think,

528
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,904
the most important-- is that
the Schrodinger evolution, this

529
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,730
is a time derivative.

530
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,150
It's a differential equation.

531
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,567
If you know the
initial condition,

532
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,941
and you know the derivative,
you can integrate it forward

533
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:08,470
in time.

534
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,836
And they're existence and
uniqueness theorems for this.

535
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,740
The system is deterministic.

536
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,600
What that means
is that if I have

537
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,795
complete knowledge of the
system at some moment in time,

538
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:25,920
if I know the wave function
at some moment in time,

539
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,720
I can determine
unambiguously the wave

540
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,840
function in all subsequent
moments of time.

541
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Unambiguously.

542
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,870
There's no probability, there's
no likelihood, it's determined.

543
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,150
Completely determined.

544
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,680
Given full knowledge now, I
will have full knowledge later.

545
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,450
Does everyone agree
that this equation

546
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,380
is a deterministic
equation in that sense?

547
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,110
Question.

548
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,193
AUDIENCE: It's also local?

549
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,510
PROFESSOR: It's all-- well, OK.

550
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,350
This one happens
to be-- you need

551
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,250
to give me a better
definition of local.

552
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,926
So give me a definition
of local that you want.

553
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,854
AUDIENCE: The time evolution
of the wave function

554
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:03,270
happens only at a
point that depends only

555
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,055
on the value of the derivatives
of the wave function

556
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,680
and its potential
energy at that point.

557
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,240
PROFESSOR: No.

558
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,420
Unfortunately,
that's not the case.

559
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,050
We'll see counter
examples of that.

560
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,165
The wave function--
the energy operator.

561
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:15,040
So let's think about
what this equation says.

562
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,748
What this says is the
time rate of change

563
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:19,110
of the value of the wave
function at some position

564
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,875
and some moment in time is the
energy operator acting on Psi

565
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,927
at x of t.

566
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,010
But I didn't tell you what
the energy operator is.

567
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,057
The energy operator
just has to be linear.

568
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:31,390
But it doesn't have to be--
it could know about the wave

569
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,223
function everywhere.

570
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:35,850
The energy operator's a map
that takes the wave function

571
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,410
and tells you what
it should be later.

572
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,550
And so, at this level there's
nothing about locality built

573
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,110
in to the energy
operator, and we'll

574
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,530
see just how bad that can be.

575
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,100
So, this is related
to your question

576
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,760
about special relativity, and
so those are deeply intertwined.

577
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,900
We don't have that
property here yet.

578
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,259
But keep that in your
mind, and ask questions

579
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:56,300
when it seems to come up.

580
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,870
Because it's a very,
very, very important

581
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,610
question when we talk
about relativity.

582
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,385
Yeah.

583
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,385
AUDIENCE: Are postulates
six and three redundant

584
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,077
if the Schrodinger equation
has superposition in it?

585
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:05,660
PROFESSOR: No.

586
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,624
Excellent question.

587
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:07,790
That's a very good question.

588
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,849
The question is, look, there's
postulate three, which says,

589
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:12,890
given any two wave functions
that are viable wave

590
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,340
functions of the
system, then there's

591
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,930
another state which
is a viable wave

592
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,570
function at some moment in time,
which is also a viable wave

593
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,120
function.

594
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,711
But number six, the Schrodinger
equation-- or sorry,

595
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,710
really the linearity
property of the Schrodinger

596
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,236
equation-- so it needs to be
the case for the Schrodinger

597
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:33,360
question, but it says
something slightly different.

598
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:42,070
It doesn't just say that any
any plausible or viable wave

599
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,360
function and another
can be superposed.

600
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,210
It says that, specifically,
any solution of the Schrodinger

601
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,150
equation plus any other solution
of the Schrodinger equation

602
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,760
is again the
Schrodinger operation.

603
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,690
So, it's a slightly
more specific thing

604
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,970
than postulate three.

605
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,180
However, your question is
excellent because could it

606
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,230
have been that the
Schrodinger evolution didn't

607
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,680
respect superposition?

608
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,410
Well, you could imagine
something, sure.

609
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,160
We could've done a
differ equation, right?

610
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,110
It might not have been linear.

611
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,068
We could have had that
Schrodinger equation was

612
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:12,970
equal to dt Psi.

613
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,240
So imagine this equation.

614
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,230
How do we have blown linearity
while preserving determinism?

615
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:25,500
So we could have added plus, I
don't know, PSI squared of x.

616
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,250
So that would now be
a nonlinear equation.

617
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,820
It's actually refer to as the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

618
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,425

619
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,050
Well, people mean
many different things

620
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,410
by the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation,

621
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,390
but that's a nonlinear
Schrodinger equation.

622
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,380
So you could certainly
write this down.

623
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,120
It's not linear.

624
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,340
Does it violate
the statement three

625
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,540
that any two states
of the system

626
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,400
could be superposed to
give another viable state

627
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
at a moment in time?

628
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,914
No, right?

629
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:56,080
It doesn't directly violate.

630
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,272
It violates the spirit of it.

631
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,730
And as we'll see
later, it actually

632
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,090
would cause dramatic problems.

633
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,896
It's something we don't
usually emphasize-- something

634
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:05,770
I don't usually emphasize
in lectures of 804,

635
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,410
but I will make
a specific effort

636
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,740
to mark the places where
this would cause disasters.

637
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,090
But, so this is actually
a logically independent,

638
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,400
although morally--
and in some sense

639
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,410
is a technically related point
to the superposition principle

640
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,710
number three.

641
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,896
Yeah.

642
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:28,175
AUDIENCE: For postulate three,
can that sum be infinite sum?

643
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,624
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

644
00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:31,556
AUDIENCE: Can you
do bad things, then,

645
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,488
like creating discontinuous
wave functions?

646
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:34,454
PROFESSOR: Oh yes.

647
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:36,150
Oh, yes you can.

648
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,090
So here's the thing.

649
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,310
Look, if you have two functions
and you add them together--

650
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,950
like two smooth
continuous functions,

651
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,616
you add them together--
what do you get?

652
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,970
You get another smooth
continuous function, right?

653
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,390
Take seven.

654
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,270
You get another.

655
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,960
But if you take an
infinite number-- look,

656
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,230
mathematicians are sneaky.

657
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,170
There's a reason we keep
them down that hall,

658
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,043
far away from us.

659
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:56,850
[LAUGHTER]

660
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,690
They're very sneaky.

661
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,680
And if you give them an infinite
number of continuous functions,

662
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,035
they'll build for you a
discontinuous function, right?

663
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:06,535
Sneaky.

664
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:09,810

665
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:13,170
Does that seem
terribly physical?

666
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,670
No.

667
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,003
It's what happens when you
give a mathematician too much

668
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:19,010
paper and time, right?

669
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,760
So, I mean this less
flippantly than I'm saying it,

670
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,910
but it's worth being a
little flippant here.

671
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,290
In a physical
setting, we will often

672
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,050
find that there are
effectively an infinite number

673
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,010
of possible things
that could happen.

674
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,970
So, for example in this room,
where is this piece of chalk?

675
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,430
It's described by a
continuous variable.

676
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,700
That's an uncountable
infinite number of positions.

677
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,800
Now, in practice,
you can't really

678
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,220
build an experiment
that does that,

679
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,136
but it is in principle
an uncountable infinity

680
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:44,100
of possible positions, right?

681
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,560
You will never get a
discontinuous wave function

682
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,590
for this guy, because
it would correspond

683
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,000
to divergent
amounts of momentum,

684
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,790
as you showed on the
previous problem set.

685
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,000
So, in general, we will often
be in a situation as physicists

686
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,690
where there's the
possibility of using

687
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,640
the machinery-- the
mathematical machinery--

688
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,790
to create pathological examples.

689
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,380
And yes, that is a risk.

690
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,260
But physically it never happens.

691
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,120
Physically it's
extraordinarily rare

692
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,910
that such infinite
divergences could matter.

693
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,080
Now, I'm not saying
that they never do.

694
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,060
But we're going to be very
carefree and casual in 804

695
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,910
and just assume that when
problems can arise from,

696
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,244
say, superposing an infinite
number of smooth functions,

697
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:24,826
leading potentially
to discontinuities

698
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:27,790
or singularities, that they will
either not happen for us-- not

699
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,480
be relevant-- or they will
happen because they're

700
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,310
forced too, so for
physical reasons

701
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,402
we'll be able to identify.

702
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:35,860
So, this is a very
important point.

703
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,526
We're not proving
mathematical theorems.

704
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,060
We're not trying to be rigorous.

705
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,590
To prove a mathematical
theorem you

706
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,530
have to look at all
the exceptional cases

707
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,700
and say, those
exceptional cases,

708
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,600
we can deal with
them mathematically.

709
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,939
To a physicist, exceptional
cases are exceptional.

710
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:49,730
They're irrelevant.

711
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,480
They don't happen.

712
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
It doesn't matter.

713
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,126
OK?

714
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,500
And it doesn't
mean that we don't

715
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,375
care about the mathematical
precision, right?

716
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,290
I mean, I publish
papers in math journals,

717
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,800
so I have a deep love
for these questions.

718
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,780
But they're not salient for
most of the physical questions

719
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,580
we care about.

720
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,440
So, do your best to try not
to let those special cases get

721
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,022
in the way of your understanding
of the general case.

722
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:12,730
I don't want you to
not think about them,

723
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,700
I just want you not
let them stop you, OK?

724
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,561
Yeah.

725
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:19,590
AUDIENCE: So, in
postulate five, you

726
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,256
mentioned that
[? functions ?] in effect

727
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:24,669
was a experiment that
more or less proves

728
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:26,100
this collapse [INAUDIBLE]

729
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,410
But, so I read that it
is not [? complicit. ?]

730
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so as with many
things in quantum mechanics--

731
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,008
that's a fair question.

732
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:37,170
So, let me make a slightly
more general statement

733
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,540
than answering that
question directly.

734
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:50,460
Many things will-- how to
say-- so, we will not prove--

735
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,150
and experimentally you almost
never prove a positive thing.

736
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,504
You can show that a prediction
is violated by experiment.

737
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,420
So there's always going
to be some uncertainty

738
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,166
in your measurements,
there's always

739
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,124
going to be some uncertainty
in your arguments.

740
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:04,070
However, in the absence
of a compelling alternate

741
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,680
theoretical
description, you cling

742
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,930
on to what you've got it as
long as it fits your data,

743
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,790
and this fits the
data like a champ.

744
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,290
Right?

745
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,630
So, does it prove?

746
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,939
No.

747
00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:14,480
It fits pretty well,
and nothing else

748
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,870
comes even within the ballpark.

749
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,260
And there's no
explicit violation

750
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,510
that's better than our
experimental uncertainties.

751
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,590
So, I don't know if
I'd say, well, we

752
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,550
could prove such a
thing, but it fits.

753
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,610
And I'm a physicist.

754
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm looking for things that fit.

755
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm not a metaphysicist.

756
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,320
I'm not trying to give you
some ontological commitment

757
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,800
about what things are true
and exist in the world, right?

758
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,610
That's not my job.

759
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,910

760
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,462
OK.

761
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:43,420
So much for our review.

762
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,010
But let me finally
come back to-- now

763
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,280
that we've observed
that it's determinist,

764
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,821
let me come back to
the question that

765
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,960
was asked a few minutes
ago, which is, look,

766
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,637
suppose we take
our superposition.

767
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,970
We evolve it forward for some
time using the Schrodinger

768
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,180
evolution.

769
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,805
Notice that it's time reversal.

770
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,180
If we know it's
time reverted, we

771
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,430
could run it
backwards just as well

772
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,620
as we could run it
forwards, right?

773
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,780
We could integrate
that in time back,

774
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,280
or we could integrate
that in time forward.

775
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,730
So, if we know the wave
function at some moment in time,

776
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,670
we can integrate it forward,
and we can integrate it back

777
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,490
in time.

778
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,360
But, If at some
point we measure,

779
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,720
then the wave
function collapses.

780
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,900
And subsequently, the
system evolves according

781
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,441
to the Schrodinger
equation, but with

782
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,100
this new initial condition.

783
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,400
So now we seem to
have a problem.

784
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,901
We seem to have--
and I believe this

785
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,233
was the question that was asked.

786
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,570
I don't remember who asked it.

787
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,111
Who asked it?

788
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:31,847

789
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:32,680
So someone asked it.

790
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,990
It was a good question.

791
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,580
We have this problem
that there seem

792
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,300
to be two definitions of time
evolution in quantum mechanics.

793
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,064
One is the Schrodinger
equation, which

794
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:42,480
says that things
deterministically

795
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,970
evolve forward in time.

796
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,530
And the second is collapse,
that if you do a measurement,

797
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,610
things non-deterministically
by probabilities collapse

798
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,020
to some possible state.

799
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,520
Yeah?

800
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,895
And the probability
is determined

801
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:01,190
by which wave function you have.

802
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,010
How can these
things both be true?

803
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,770
How can you have two different
definitions of time evolution?

804
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,700
So, this sort of
frustration lies

805
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,180
at the heart of much
of the sort of spiel

806
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,247
about the interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

807
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,830
On the one hand, we
want to say, well,

808
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,520
the world is inescapably
probabilistic.

809
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,909
Measurement comes with
probabilistic outcomes

810
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:23,700
and leads to collapse
of the wave function.

811
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,491
On the other hand, when
you're not looking,

812
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,340
the system evolves
deterministically.

813
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,167
And this sounds horrible.

814
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,000
It sounds horrible to
a classical physicist.

815
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,830
It sounds horrible to me.

816
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,790
It just sounds awful.

817
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,920
It sounds arbitrary.

818
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,030
Meanwhile, it makes it
sound like the world cares.

819
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,930
It evolves differently depending
on whether you're looking

820
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,700
or not.

821
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,000
And that-- come on.

822
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,560
I mean, I think we can all
agree that that's just crazy.

823
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,920
So what's going on?

824
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,940
So for a long time, physicists
in practice-- and still

825
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,550
in practice-- for a
long time physicists

826
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,490
almost exclusively
looked at this problem

827
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,710
and said, look,
don't worry about.

828
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,970
It fits the data.

829
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,820
It makes good predictions.

830
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,950
Work with me here.

831
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,590
Right?

832
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,210
And it's really hard to
argue against that attitude.

833
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,290
You have a set of rules.

834
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,350
It allows you to compute things.

835
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,058
You compute them.

836
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,300
They fit the data.

837
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,900
Done.

838
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,140
That is triumph.

839
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,870
But it's deeply disconcerting.

840
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,900
So, over the last, I
don't know, in the second

841
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,670
or the last quarter,
roughly, the last third

842
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,080
of the 20th century,
various people

843
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,530
started getting more
upset about this.

844
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,530
So, this notion of just
shut up and calculate,

845
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,870
which has been enshrined
in the physics literature,

846
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,880
goes under the name of the
Copenhagen interpretation,

847
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,540
which roughly says,
look, just do this.

848
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,270
Don't ask.

849
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,100
Compute the numbers,
and get what you will.

850
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:55,200
And people have questioned the
sanity or wisdom of doing that.

851
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,061
And in particular,
there's an idea--

852
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:59,560
so I refer to the Copenhagen
interpretation with my students

853
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,000
as the cop out,
because it's basically

854
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,240
disavowal of responsibility.

855
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,620
Look, it doesn't make
sense, but I'm not

856
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,545
responsible for making sense.

857
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:08,378
I'm just responsible
for making predictions.

858
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:09,050
Come on.

859
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,680
So, more recently has come
the theory of decoherence.

860
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,650
And we're not going to
talk about it in any detail

861
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,530
until the last couple
lectures of 804.

862
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,060
Decoherence.

863
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,310
I can't spell to save my life.

864
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,740
So, the theory of decoherence.

865
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,580
And here's roughly
what the theory says.

866
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,670
The theory says,
look, the reason

867
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,530
you have this problem between
on the one hand, Schrodinger

868
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,850
evolution of a quantum
system, and on the other hand,

869
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,420
measurement leading
to collapse, is

870
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,760
that in the case of measurement
meaning to collapse,

871
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
you're not really studying the
evolution of a quantum system.

872
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
You're studying the evolution
of a quantum system-- ie

873
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,977
a little thing that you're
measuring-- interacting

874
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,060
with your experimental
apparatus, which is made up

875
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,600
of 10 to the 27th particles,
and you made up of 10

876
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
to the 28 particles.

877
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,820
Whatever.

878
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,865
It's a large number.

879
00:32:56,865 --> 00:32:58,750
OK, a lot more than that.

880
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,272
You, a macroscopic object,
where classical dynamics

881
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:05,230
are a good description.

882
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,605
In particular,
what that means is

883
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:08,600
that the quantum effects
are being washed out.

884
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,110
You're washing out
the interference

885
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,400
of fringes, which is why
I can catch this thing

886
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,910
and not have it split into
many different possible wave

887
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,940
functions and where it went.

888
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,694
So, dealing with that is hard,
because now if you really

889
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,860
want to treat the system
with Schrodinger evolution,

890
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,859
you have to study the
trajectory and the motion,

891
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:27,640
the dynamics, of every particle
in the system, every degree

892
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,930
of freedom in the system.

893
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,831
So here's the question that
decoherence is trying to ask.

894
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,080
If you take a system where
you have one little quantum

895
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
subsystem that you're
trying to measure,

896
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,990
and then again a gagillion
other degrees of freedom,

897
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,850
some of which you care
about-- they're made of you--

898
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,880
some of which you don't,
like the particles

899
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,760
of gas in the room,
the environment.

900
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,700
If you take that whole
system, does Schrodinger

901
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,180
evolution in the end
boil down to collapse

902
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,650
for that single
quantum microsystem?

903
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,460
And the answer is yes.

904
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,720
Showing that take
some work, and we'll

905
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,300
touch on it at the end of 804.

906
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,010
But I want to mark
right here that this

907
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,690
is one of the most deeply
unsatisfying points

908
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,070
in the basic story
of quantum mechanics,

909
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,239
and that it's deeply
unsatisfying because of the way

910
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,750
that we're presenting it.

911
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,550
And there's a much
more satisfying--

912
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,540
although still you
never escape the fact

913
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,909
that quantum mechanics
violates your intuition.

914
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:17,889
That's inescapable.

915
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,750
But at least it's not illogical.

916
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,659
it doesn't directly
contradict itself.

917
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,500
So that story is the
story of decoherence.

918
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,139
And if we're very
lucky, I think we'll

919
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,679
try to get one of my friends
who's a quantum computing

920
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,610
guy to talk about it.

921
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,540
Yeah.

922
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Is it possible

923
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,639
that we get two
different results?

924
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,560
PROFESSOR: No.

925
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,060
No.

926
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,560
No.

927
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,889
There's never any ambiguity
about what result you got.

928
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,139
You never end up in a state
of-- and this is also something

929
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,805
that decoherence is
supposed to explain.

930
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:50,850
You never end up in a situation
where you go like, wait, wait.

931
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,710
I don't know.

932
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,293
Maybe it was here,
maybe it was there.

933
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm really confused.

934
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,986
I mean, you can get
up in that situation

935
00:34:55,986 --> 00:34:57,550
because you did a
bad job, but you

936
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,900
don't end up in that
situation because you're

937
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,220
in a superposition state.

938
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,442
You always end up when you're
a classical beast doing

939
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:03,900
a classical
measurement, you always

940
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,070
end up in some definite state.

941
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,060
Now, what wave
function describes

942
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,520
you doesn't
necessarily correspond

943
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,400
to you being in a simple state.

944
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
You might be in a superposition
of thinking this and thinking

945
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,080
that.

946
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,690
But, when you think this,
that's in fact what happened.

947
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,651
And when you think that,
that's in fact what happened.

948
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,150
OK.

949
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,190
So I'm going to leave
this alone for the moment,

950
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,350
but I just wanted to mark
that as an important part

951
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,120
of the quantum mechanical story.

952
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,430
OK.

953
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,771
So let's go on to solving
the Schrodinger equation.

954
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,520
So what I want to do
for the rest of today

955
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,478
is talk about solving
the Schrodinger equation.

956
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:43,740

957
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,115
So when we set about solving
the Schrodinger equation,

958
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:47,490
the first thing
we should realize

959
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,490
is that at the end of the
day, the Schrodinger equation

960
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,890
is just some
differential equation.

961
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,390
And in fact, it's a particularly
easy differential equation.

962
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,460
It's a first order linear
differential equation.

963
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,960
Right?

964
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,750
We know how to solve those.

965
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,104
But, while it's
first order in time,

966
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,270
we have to think about what
this energy operator is.

967
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,370
So, just like the Newton
equation f equals ma,

968
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,995
we have to specify
the energy operative

969
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:10,330
before we can actually solve
the dynamics of the system.

970
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,788
In f equals ma, we
have to tell you

971
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:14,280
what the force is before
we can solve for p,

972
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,554
from p is equal to f.

973
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,220
So, for example.

974
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,880

975
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,930
So one strategy to solve
the Schrodinger equation

976
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,605
is to say, look, it's just
a differential equation,

977
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:28,480
and I'll solve it using
differential equation

978
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,510
techniques.

979
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,690
So let me specify, for
example, the energy operator.

980
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,190
What's an easy energy operator?

981
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,230
Well, imagine you had a harmonic
oscillator, which, you know,

982
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,930
physicists, that's your go-to.

983
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,380
So, harmonic
oscillator has energy p

984
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,840
squared over 2m plus M Omega
squared upon 2x squared.

985
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,480
But we're going
quantum mechanics,

986
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,882
so we replace these
guys by operators.

987
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:55,090
So that's an energy operator.

988
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,520
It's a perfectly
viable operator.

989
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,240
And what is the differential
equation that this leads to?

990
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,050
What's the Schrodinger
equation leads to?

991
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,216
Well, I'm going to put the
ih bar on the other side.

992
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:10,300
ih bar derivative with respect
to time of Psi of x and t

993
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,210
is equal to p squared.

994
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,200
Well, we remember that
p is equal to h bar

995
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,160
upon i, derivative
with respect to x.

996
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,120
So p squared is minus h bar
squared derivative with respect

997
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,270
to x squared upon 2m, or
minus h bar squared upon 2m.

998
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,042

999
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,425
Psi prime prime.

1000
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:31,200
Let me write this as dx squared.

1001
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,570
Two spatial derivatives acting
on Psi of x and t plus m

1002
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:44,720
omega squared upon 2x
squared Psi of x and t.

1003
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,160
So here's a
differential equation.

1004
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,241
And if we want to know how
does a system evolve in time,

1005
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,240
ie given some initial
wave function, how does it

1006
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,531
evolve in time, we just take
this differential equation

1007
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:56,280
and we solve it.

1008
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,540
And there are many tools to
solve this partial differential

1009
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,040
equation.

1010
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,300
For example, you could
put it on Mathematica

1011
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,175
and just use NDSolve, right?

1012
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:04,550
This wasn't
available, of course,

1013
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,480
to the physicists at
the turn of the century,

1014
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,467
but they were less timid
about differential equations

1015
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,550
than we are, because they
didn't have Mathematica.

1016
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,130
So, this is a very
straightforward differential

1017
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,950
equation to solve,
and we're going

1018
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,510
to solve it in a
couple of lectures.

1019
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,801
We're going to study the
harmonic oscillator in detail.

1020
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:20,430
What I want to emphasize for
you is that any system has have

1021
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,540
some specified energy operator,
just like any classical system,

1022
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,980
has some definite
force function.

1023
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,780
And given that energy
operator, that's

1024
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,100
going to lead to a
differential equation.

1025
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,975
So one way to solve the
differential equation

1026
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:35,040
is just to go ahead and
brute force solve it.

1027
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,770
But, at the end of
the day, solving

1028
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,520
the Schrodinger equation
is always, always

1029
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,180
going to boil down
to some version

1030
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,900
morally of solve this
differential equation.

1031
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,119
Questions about that?

1032
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,900
OK.

1033
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,129
But when we actually look
at a differential equation

1034
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,420
like this-- so, say we have
this differential equation.

1035
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,211
It's got a derivative
with respect to time,

1036
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:57,210
so we have to specify
some initial condition.

1037
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,010
There are many ways to solve it.

1038
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:06,250
So given E, given
some specific E,

1039
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,190
given some specific
energy operator,

1040
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,420
there are many ways to solve.

1041
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,570

1042
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,444
The resulting
differential equation.

1043
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:18,485
And I'm just going to mark
that, in general, it's

1044
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:20,100
a PDE, because it's got
derivatives with respect

1045
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,016
to time and derivatives
with respect to space.

1046
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:25,810

1047
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,950
And roughly speaking,
all these techniques

1048
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,300
fall into three camps.

1049
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,700
The first is just brute force.

1050
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,440

1051
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,230
That means some analog of
throw it on Mathematica,

1052
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,262
go to the closet and pull
out your mathematician

1053
00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:41,560
and tie them to the
chalkboard until they're done,

1054
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,520
and then put them back.

1055
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,600
But some version of a
brute force, which is just

1056
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,700
use, by hook or by
crook, some technique

1057
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,710
that allows you to solve
the differential equation.

1058
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,500
OK.

1059
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,810
The second is
extreme cleverness.

1060
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,990
And you'd be amazed how
often this comes in handy.

1061
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,490
So, extreme
cleverness-- which we'll

1062
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,610
see both of these
techniques used

1063
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,860
for the harmonic oscillator.

1064
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,200
That's what we'll do next week.

1065
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,790
First, the brute
force, and secondly,

1066
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,909
the clever way of solving
the harmonic oscillator.

1067
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,950
When I say extreme
cleverness, what I really mean

1068
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,310
is a more elegant use
of your mathematician.

1069
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,890
You know something
about the structure,

1070
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,430
the mathematical structure of
your differential equation.

1071
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,690
And you're going to
use that structure

1072
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,240
to figure out a good way to
organize the differential

1073
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,500
equation, the good way
to organize the problem.

1074
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,977
And that will teach you physics.

1075
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:33,310
And the reason I distinguish
brute force from cleverness

1076
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,850
in this sense is
that brute force,

1077
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,890
you just get a list of numbers.

1078
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,764
Cleverness, you learn
something about the way

1079
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,750
the physics of the
system operates.

1080
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,264
We'll see this at work
in the next two lectures.

1081
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,555
And see, I really should
separate this out numerically.

1082
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:48,760

1083
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,100
And here I don't just mean
sticking it into MATLAB.

1084
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,850
Numerically, it can
be enormously valuable

1085
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,690
for a bunch of reasons.

1086
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,130
First off, there
are often situations

1087
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,330
where no classic technique
in differential equations

1088
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,760
or no simple mathematical
structure that would just

1089
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,780
leap to the imagination
comes to use.

1090
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
And you have some horrible
differential you just

1091
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,100
have to solve, and you
can solve it numerically.

1092
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,220
Very useful lesson, and
a reason to not even--

1093
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,720
how many of y'all are thinking
about being theorists of some

1094
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,540
stripe or other?

1095
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,040
OK.

1096
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,080
And how many of y'all
are thinking about being

1097
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,260
experimentalists of
some stripe or another?

1098
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,990
OK, cool.

1099
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,380
So, look, there's this
deep, deep prejudice

1100
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,030
in theory against numerical
solutions of problems.

1101
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,640
It's myopia.

1102
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,140
It's a terrible attitude,
and here's the reason.

1103
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,220
Computers are stupid.

1104
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,050
Computers are
breathtakingly dumb.

1105
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,800
They will do whatever
you tell them to do,

1106
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,091
but they will not tell you
that was a dumb thing to do.

1107
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:40,940
They have no idea.

1108
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,830
So, in order to solve an
interesting physical problem,

1109
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,480
you have to first
extract all the physics

1110
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,770
and organize the
problem in such a way

1111
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,510
that a stupid computer
can do the solution.

1112
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,430
As a consequence, you learn
the physics about the problem.

1113
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,019
It's extremely valuable to
learn how to solve problems

1114
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,310
numerically, and we're going
to have problem sets later

1115
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,100
in the course in
which you're going

1116
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,010
to be required to
numerically solve

1117
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,020
some of these
differential equations.

1118
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,340
But it's useful because
you get numbers,

1119
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,810
and you can check
against data, but also it

1120
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,640
lets you in the process
of understanding

1121
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,681
how to solve the problem.

1122
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:17,360
You learn things
about the problem.

1123
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,640
So I want to mark that as a
separate logical way to do it.

1124
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,690
So today, I want to
start our analysis

1125
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,070
by looking at a
couple of examples

1126
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,430
of solving the
Schrodinger equation.

1127
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:38,740
And I want to start by looking
at energy Eigenfunctions.

1128
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,540

1129
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:54,780
And then once we understand how
a single energy Eigenfunction

1130
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,975
evolves in time, once we
understand that solution

1131
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,570
to the Schrodinger
equation, we're

1132
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,660
going to use the linearity
of the Schrodinger equation

1133
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,380
to write down a general solution
of the Schrodinger equation.

1134
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,940
OK.

1135
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,840
So, first.

1136
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,090
What happens if we have a
single energy Eigenfunction?

1137
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,820
So, suppose our wave function
as a function of x at time t

1138
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,570
equals zero is in a known
configuration, which

1139
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,480
is an energy Eigenfunction
Phi sub E of x.

1140
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,270
What I mean by Phi sub E of x is
if I take the energy operator,

1141
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,050
and I act on Phi sub E
of x, this gives me back

1142
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,620
the number E Phi sub E of x.

1143
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,994

1144
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:38,920
OK?

1145
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,830
So it's an Eigenfunction of the
energy operator, the Eigenvalue

1146
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,460
E.

1147
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,560
So, suppose our
initial condition is

1148
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,090
that our system
began life at time t

1149
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:51,306
equals zero in this state with
definite energy E. Everyone

1150
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:52,360
cool with that?

1151
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,810
First off, question.

1152
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,400
Suppose I immediately
at time zero

1153
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,210
measure the energy
of this system.

1154
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,310
What will I get?

1155
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,726
AUDIENCE: E.

1156
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,100
PROFESSOR: With
what probability?

1157
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,000
AUDIENCE: 100%

1158
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,920
PROFESSOR: 100%, because this
is, in fact, of this form,

1159
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,890
it's a superposition
of energy Eigenstates,

1160
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,350
except there's only one term.

1161
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,850
And the coefficient
of that one term

1162
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,170
is one, and the probability
that I measure the energy

1163
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,170
to be equal to that value is
the coefficient norm squared,

1164
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,040
and that's one norm squared.

1165
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,499
Everyone cool with that?

1166
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:25,040
Consider on the other hand, if
I had taken this wave function

1167
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,390
and I had multiplied it
by phase E to the i Alpha.

1168
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,370
What now is the probability
where alpha is just a number?

1169
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,380
What now is the probability
that I measured the state

1170
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,710
to have energy E?

1171
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,455
AUDIENCE: One.

1172
00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:38,580
PROFESSOR: It's still one,
because the norm squared

1173
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,430
of a phase is one.

1174
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,266
Right?

1175
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:42,180
OK.

1176
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,530
The overall phase
does not matter.

1177
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,540
So, suppose I have this
as my initial condition.

1178
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,630
Let's take away
the overall phase

1179
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,921
because my life will be easier.

1180
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,094

1181
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:54,260
So here's the wave function.

1182
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,635
What is the
Schrodinger equation?

1183
00:44:55,635 --> 00:44:57,330
Well, the Schrodinger
equation says

1184
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,550
that ih bar time
derivative of Psi

1185
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,409
is equal to the energy
operator acting on Psi.

1186
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,450
And I should be specific.

1187
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:11,740
This is Psi at x at time t,
Eigenvalued at this time zero

1188
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,610
is equal to the energy operator
acting on this wave function.

1189
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,880
But what's the energy operator
acting on this wave function?

1190
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,380
AUDIENCE: E.

1191
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,420
PROFESSOR: E. E on
Psi is equal to E

1192
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,750
on Phi sub E, which
is just E the number.

1193
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,720
This is the number E,
the Eigenvalue E times

1194
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,867
Psi at x zero.

1195
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:34,200
And now, instead of having
an operator on the right hand

1196
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,814
side, we just have a number.

1197
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:38,230
So, I'm going to write this
differential equation slightly

1198
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,470
differently, ie time
derivative of Psi

1199
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:54,450
is equal to E upon ih bar,
or minus ie over h bar Psi.

1200
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,941

1201
00:45:58,941 --> 00:45:59,440
Yeah?

1202
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,439
Everyone cool with that?

1203
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:04,050
This is the easiest differential
equation in the world to solve.

1204
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,700
So, the time derivative
is a constant.

1205
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,090
Well, times itself.

1206
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:13,660
That means that
therefore Psi at x and t

1207
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:23,329
is equal to E to the minus i
ET over h bar Psi at x zero.

1208
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:25,620
Where I've imposed the initial
condition that at time t

1209
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,310
equals zero, the
wave function is

1210
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,980
just equal to Psi of x at zero.

1211
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,340

1212
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,250
And in particular, I know
what Psi of x and zero is.

1213
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,360
It's Phi E of x.

1214
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,836
So I can simply write
this as Phi E of x.

1215
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:44,970

1216
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,850
Are we cool with that?

1217
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,420
So, what this tells me is
that under time evolution,

1218
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,284
a state which is initially
in an energy Eigenstate

1219
00:46:55,284 --> 00:46:57,450
remains in an energy
Eigenstate with the same energy

1220
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:57,975
Eigenvalue.

1221
00:46:57,975 --> 00:47:00,100
The only thing that changes
about the wave function

1222
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,320
is that its phase
changes, and its phase

1223
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,300
changes by rotating with
a constant velocity.

1224
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,270
E to the minus i, the
energy Eigenvalue,

1225
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,674
times time upon h bar.

1226
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:12,840
Now, first off, before we
do anything else as usual,

1227
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,923
we should first check the
dimensions of our result

1228
00:47:14,923 --> 00:47:16,680
to make sure we
didn't make a goof.

1229
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,860
So, does this make
sense dimensionally?

1230
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,806
Let's quickly check.

1231
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,449
Yeah, it does.

1232
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:24,490
Let's just quickly check.

1233
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:30,791
So we have that the exponent
there is Et over h bar.

1234
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:31,290
OK?

1235
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,650
And this should have dimensions
of what in order to make sense?

1236
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,630
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

1237
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,220
PROFESSOR: Nothing, exactly.

1238
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,410
It should be dimensionless.

1239
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,554
So what are the
dimensions of h bar?

1240
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:39,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1241
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,800
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, the
dimensions, guys, not

1242
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,240
the units.

1243
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,239
What are the dimensions?

1244
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:44,205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1245
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:46,330
PROFESSOR: It's an action,
which is energy of time.

1246
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,146
So the units of
the dimensions of h

1247
00:47:49,146 --> 00:47:51,480
are an energy times
a time, also known

1248
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,651
as a momentum times a position.

1249
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:55,150
OK?

1250
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:03,350

1251
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,280
So, this has dimensions of
action or energy times time,

1252
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,780
and then upstairs
we have dimensions

1253
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,590
of energy times time.

1254
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,510
So that's consistent.

1255
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,510
So this in fact is dimensionally
sensible, which is good.

1256
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,310
Now, this tells you a
very important thing.

1257
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,590
In fact, we just
answered this equation.

1258
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,100
At time t equals
zero, what will we

1259
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,290
get if we measure the energy?

1260
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,480
E. At time t prime-- some
subsequent time-- what energy

1261
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,180
will we measure?

1262
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:27,874
AUDIENCE: E.

1263
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:28,540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1264
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,810
Does the energy
change over time?

1265
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,440
No.

1266
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,530
When I say that, what I
mean is, does the energy

1267
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,410
that you expect to
measure change over time?

1268
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:36,730
No.

1269
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,645
Does the probability that
you measure energy E change?

1270
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:41,228
No, because it's just a phase,
and the norm squared of a phase

1271
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,400
is one.

1272
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,440
Yeah?

1273
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,160
Everyone cool with that?

1274
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,109
Questions at this point.

1275
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:49,650
This is very simple
example, but it's

1276
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,270
going to have a lot of power.

1277
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,061
Oh, yeah, question.

1278
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:51,850
Thank you.

1279
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,224
AUDIENCE: Are we going to deal
with energy operators that

1280
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,100
change over time?

1281
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,350
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

1282
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,470
We will later, but not in 804.

1283
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,020
In 805, you'll discuss
it in more detail.

1284
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,650
Nothing dramatic
happens, but you just

1285
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,405
have to add more symbols.

1286
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:07,700
There's nothing deep about it.

1287
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,370
It's a very good question.

1288
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,953
The question was,
are we going to deal

1289
00:49:09,953 --> 00:49:12,877
with energy operators
that change in time?

1290
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:14,960
My answer was no, not in
804, but you will in 805.

1291
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,550
And what you'll find is
that it's not a big deal.

1292
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,200
Nothing particularly
dramatic happens.

1293
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,530
We will deal with systems where
the energy operator changes

1294
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,455
instantaneously.

1295
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:26,080
So not a continuous
function, but we're

1296
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,830
at some of them you turn
on the electric field,

1297
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,890
or something like that.

1298
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,719
So we'll deal with
that later on.

1299
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,760
But we won't develop a
theory of energy operators

1300
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,490
that depend on time.

1301
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,110
But you could do it,
and you will do in 805.

1302
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,610
There's nothing
mysterious about it.

1303
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,400
Other questions?

1304
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,760
OK.

1305
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,770
So, these states-- a
state Psi of x and t,

1306
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,690
which is of the form e
to the minus i Omega t,

1307
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,117
where Omega is equal
to E over h bar.

1308
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:57,200
This should look familiar.

1309
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,770
It's the de Broglie relation,
[INAUDIBLE] relation, whatever.

1310
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,370
Times some Phi E
of x, where this

1311
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,290
is an energy Eigenfunction.

1312
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,390
These states are called
stationary states.

1313
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:19,459

1314
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:20,750
And what's the reason for that?

1315
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,333
Why are they called
stationary states?

1316
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,160
I'm going to erase this.

1317
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,990
Well, suppose this is my wave
function as a function of time.

1318
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,030
What is the probability
that at time t

1319
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,080
I will measure the particle
to be at position x,

1320
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,205
or the probability density?

1321
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:36,980

1322
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,580
Well, the probability density
we know from our postulates,

1323
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,580
it's just the norm squared
of the wave function.

1324
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,090
This is Psi at x t norm squared.

1325
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,500
But this is equal to
the norm squared of e

1326
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,024
to the minus Psi Omega t Phi
E by the Schrodinger equation.

1327
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:54,440
But when we take
the norm squared,

1328
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,720
this phase cancels
out, as we already saw.

1329
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,600
So this is just equal to
Phi E of x norm squared,

1330
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,820
the energy Eigenfunction norm
squared independent of time.

1331
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:11,700

1332
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,100
So, if we happen to know that
our state is in an energy

1333
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,100
Eigenfunction, then
the probability density

1334
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,180
for finding the particle
at any given position

1335
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,550
does not change in time.

1336
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,520
It remains invariant.

1337
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,620
The wave function rotates
by an overall phase,

1338
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,620
but the probability density
is the norm squared.

1339
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,070
It's insensitive to
that overall phase,

1340
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,650
and so the probability
density just

1341
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,358
remains constant in
whatever shape it is.

1342
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,439

1343
00:51:33,439 --> 00:51:34,980
Hence it's called
a stationary state.

1344
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,470
Notice its consequence.

1345
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,440
What can you say about
the expectation value

1346
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,030
of the position as
a function of time?

1347
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,090

1348
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,360
Well, this is equal
to the integral dx

1349
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,702
in the state Psi of x and t.

1350
00:51:50,702 --> 00:51:52,740
And I'll call this Psi
sub E just to emphasize.

1351
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,990
It's the integral of the x,
integral over all possible

1352
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,520
positions of the
probability distribution,

1353
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,570
probability of x
at time t times x.

1354
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,610
But this is equal
to the integral dx

1355
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:08,760
of Phi E of x squared x.

1356
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,680
But that's equal to expectation
value of x at any time,

1357
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,640
or time zero. t equals zero.

1358
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,030
And maybe the best way to write
this is as a function of time.

1359
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,940
So, the expectation value
of x doesn't change.

1360
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,010
In a stationary state,
expected positions,

1361
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,840
energy-- these
things don't change.

1362
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,430
Everyone cool with that?

1363
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,240
And it's because
of this basic fact

1364
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,260
that the wave
function only rotates

1365
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,512
by a phase under
time evolution when

1366
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,970
the system is an
energy Eigenstate.

1367
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,010

1368
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,320
Questions?

1369
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,200
OK.

1370
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,960
So, here's a couple of
questions for you guys.

1371
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,320

1372
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,740
Are all systems always
in energy Eigenstates?

1373
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,950

1374
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,320
Am I in an energy Eigenstate?

1375
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,530

1376
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,490
AUDIENCE: No.

1377
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,690
PROFESSOR: No, right?

1378
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,950
OK, expected position of my
hand is changing in time.

1379
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:14,240
I am not in-- so obviously,
things change in time.

1380
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,267
Energies change in time.

1381
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:18,600
Positions-- expected typical
positions-- change in time.

1382
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,740
We are not in
energy Eigenstates.

1383
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,590
That's a highly
non-generic state.

1384
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,160
So here's another question.

1385
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,790
Are any states ever truly
in energy Eigenstates?

1386
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:32,670

1387
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,790
Can you imagine an
object in the world

1388
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,680
that is truly
described precisely

1389
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,717
by an energy Eigenstate
in the real world?

1390
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:42,258
AUDIENCE: No.

1391
00:53:42,258 --> 00:53:44,962

1392
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:46,670
PROFESSOR: Ok, there
have been a few nos.

1393
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,410
Why?

1394
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,050
Why not?

1395
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:53,360
Does anything really
remain invariant in time?

1396
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,370
No, right?

1397
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,060
Everything is getting
buffeted around

1398
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,480
by the rest of the universe.

1399
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,030
So, not only are these
not typical states,

1400
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,050
not only are stationary
states not typical,

1401
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,970
but they actually never
exist in the real world.

1402
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,930
So why am I talking
about them at all?

1403
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:11,030

1404
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,600
So here's why.

1405
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,350
And actually I'm
going to do this here.

1406
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:16,950
So here's why.

1407
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,810
The reason is this guy, the
superposition principle,

1408
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:25,940
which tells me that if
I have possible states,

1409
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,557
I can build
superpositions of them.

1410
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:29,182
And this statement--
and in particular,

1411
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,180
linearity-- which says
that given any two

1412
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,250
solutions of the
Schrodinger equation,

1413
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,210
I can take a
superposition and build

1414
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,170
a new solution of the
Schrodinger equation.

1415
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,220
So, let me build it.

1416
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,720
So, in particular,
I want to exploit

1417
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,770
the linearity of the Schrodinger
equation to do the following.

1418
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,470

1419
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,850
Suppose Psi.

1420
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,400
And I'm going to
label these by n.

1421
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:02,590
Psi n of x and t is equal
to e to the minus i Omega nt

1422
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:09,632
Phi sub En of x, where En
is equal to h bar Omega n.

1423
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:11,840
n labels the various different
energy Eigenfunctions.

1424
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,290
So, consider all the energy
Eigenfunctions Phi sub En.

1425
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,690
n is a number which labels them.

1426
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,540
And this is the solution to
the Schrodinger equation, which

1427
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,310
at time zero is just
equal to the energy

1428
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:25,440
Eigenfunction of interest.

1429
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,345
Cool?

1430
00:55:26,345 --> 00:55:30,060
So, consider these guys.

1431
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,280
So, suppose we have
these guys such that they

1432
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:40,160
solve the Schrodinger equation.

1433
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,127
Solve the Schrodinger equation.

1434
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:44,210
Suppose these guys solve
the Schrodinger equation.

1435
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,790
Then, by linearity, we
can take Psi of x and t

1436
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:54,950
to be an arbitrary superposition
sum over n, c sub n, Psi sub

1437
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,480
n of x and t.

1438
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,460
And this will automatically
solve the Schrodinger equation

1439
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,660
by linearity of the
Schrodinger equation.

1440
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,194
Yeah.

1441
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,569
AUDIENCE: But
can't we just get n

1442
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:07,902
as the sum of the
energy Eigenstate

1443
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:10,840
by just applying that and
by just measuring that?

1444
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,080
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

1445
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,080
So, here's the question.

1446
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,660
The question is,
look, a minute ago

1447
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,010
you said no system is truly in
an energy Eigenstate, right?

1448
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,435
But can't we put a system
in an energy Eigenstate

1449
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:26,630
by just measuring the energy?

1450
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,130
Right?

1451
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,720
Isn't that exactly what the
collapse postulate says?

1452
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,806
So here's my question.

1453
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,430
How confident are
you that you actually

1454
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,370
measure the energy precisely?

1455
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,930
With what accuracy can
we measure the energy?

1456
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,430
So here's the unfortunate
truth, the unfortunate practical

1457
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,585
truth.

1458
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:42,610
And I'm not talking about
in principle things.

1459
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,151
I'm talking about it in practice
things in the real universe.

1460
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,840
When you measure the energy of
something, you've got a box,

1461
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,430
and the box has a dial,
and the dial has a needle,

1462
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,570
it has a finite width,
and your current meter

1463
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,800
has a finite sensitivity
to the current.

1464
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,040
So you never truly measure
the energy exactly.

1465
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,440
You measure it to
within some tolerance.

1466
00:56:59,440 --> 00:56:59,940
And

1467
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,180
In fact, there's a
fundamental bound--

1468
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,140
there's a fundamental bound on
the accuracy with which you can

1469
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,425
make a measurement, which
is just the following.

1470
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,550
And this is the analog of
the uncertainty equation.

1471
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,760
We'll talk about
this more later,

1472
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,470
but let me just jump
ahead a little bit.

1473
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,600
Suppose I want to
measure frequency.

1474
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,180
So I have some
signal, and I look

1475
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,610
at that signal for 10 minutes.

1476
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,200
OK?

1477
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,480
Can I be absolutely confident
that this signal is in fact

1478
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,210
a plane wave with the given
frequency that I just did?

1479
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,390
No, because it could
change outside that.

1480
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,806
But more to the
point, there might

1481
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:33,300
have been small
variations inside.

1482
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,510
There could've been
a wavelength that

1483
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:38,140
could change on a time
scale longer than the time

1484
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,900
that I measured.

1485
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,180
So, to know that the
system doesn't change

1486
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,930
on a arbitrary-- that
it's strictly fixed Omega,

1487
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,640
I have to wait a very long time.

1488
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,470
And in particular, how confident
you can be of the frequency

1489
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:55,430
is bounded by the time over
which-- so your confidence,

1490
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,290
your uncertainty
in the frequency,

1491
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,460
is bounded in the
following fashion.

1492
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,180
Delta Omega, Delta t is always
greater than or equal to one,

1493
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,904
approximately.

1494
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:07,320
What this says is
that if you want

1495
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,440
to be absolute confident
of the frequency,

1496
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,817
you have to wait an
arbitrarily long time.

1497
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:13,650
Now if I multiply this
whole thing by h bar,

1498
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:14,640
I get the following.

1499
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,010
Delta E-- so this is
a classic equation

1500
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,480
that signals analysis--
Delta E, Delta t

1501
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,817
is greater than or
approximately equal to h bar.

1502
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:25,025
This is a hallowed time-
energy uncertainty relation,

1503
00:58:25,025 --> 00:58:27,580
which we haven't talked about.

1504
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,400
So, in fact, it is
possible to make

1505
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,510
an arbitrarily precise
measurement of the energy.

1506
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,240
What do I have to do?

1507
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,070
I have to wait forever.

1508
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,450
How patient are you, right?

1509
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,400
So, that's the issue.

1510
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,630
In the real world, we can't make
arbitrarily long measurements,

1511
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,800
and we can't isolate systems
for an arbitrarily long amount

1512
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,379
of time.

1513
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:46,670
So, we can't put things in
a definite energy Eigenstate

1514
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,017
by measurement.

1515
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:49,100
That answer your question?

1516
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,683
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1517
00:58:49,683 --> 00:58:50,815
PROFESSOR: Great.

1518
00:58:50,815 --> 00:58:52,190
How many people
have seen signals

1519
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,520
in this expression, the
bound on the frequency?

1520
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,150
Oh, good.

1521
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,240
So we'll talk about that
later in the course.

1522
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,030
OK, so coming back to this.

1523
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,120
So, we have our solutions
of the Schrodinger equation

1524
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,786
that are initially
energy Eigenstates.

1525
00:59:07,786 --> 00:59:10,035
I claim I can take an arbitrary
superposition of them,

1526
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:14,705
and by linearity derive
that this is also

1527
00:59:14,705 --> 00:59:16,330
a solution to the
Schrodinger equation.

1528
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,840

1529
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:29,300
And in particular, what
that tells me is-- well,

1530
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,000
another way to say
this is that if I

1531
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,660
know that Psi of x times zero
is equal to sum over n-- so

1532
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,706
if sum Psi of x--
if the wave function

1533
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,080
at some particular
moment in time

1534
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:50,064
can be expanded as sum over
n Cn Phi E of x, if this is

1535
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:51,980
my initial condition,
my initial wave function

1536
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,007
is some superposition, then I
know what the wave function is

1537
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:56,840
at subsequent times.

1538
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,530
The wave function by
superposition Psi of x and t

1539
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:05,400
is equal to sum over
n Cn e to the minus i

1540
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,830
Omega nt Phi n-- sorry, this
should've been Phi sub n-- Phi

1541
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,750
n of x.

1542
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:21,109

1543
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:22,900
And I know this has to
be true because this

1544
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,710
is a solution to the Schrodinger
equation by construction,

1545
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,475
and at time t equals
zero, it reduces to this.

1546
01:00:28,475 --> 01:00:30,600
So, this is a solution to
the Schrodinger equation,

1547
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,950
satisfying this condition at
the initial time t equals zero.

1548
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,520
Don't even have to
do a calculation.

1549
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,646
So, having solved the
Schrodinger equation once

1550
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:40,020
for energy,
Eigenstates allows me

1551
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,860
to solve it for
general superposition.

1552
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,950
However, what I just
said isn't quite enough.

1553
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,120
I need one more argument.

1554
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:52,260
And that one more argument is
really the stronger version

1555
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,600
of three that we talked
about before, which

1556
01:00:54,600 --> 01:01:05,090
is that, given an
energy operator E,

1557
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,720
we find the set of
wave functions Phi sub

1558
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,610
E, the Eigenfunctions
of the energy operator,

1559
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,680
with Eigenvalue E.

1560
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,620
So, given the energy operator,
we find its Eigenfunctions.

1561
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,300
Any wave function Psi at
x-- we'll say at time zero--

1562
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,930
any function of x can
be expanded as a sum.

1563
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:34,530
Specific superposition sum
over n Cn Phi E sub n of x.

1564
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:38,010

1565
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,860
And if any function
can be expanded

1566
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,140
as a superposition of
energy Eigenfunctions,

1567
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,985
and we know how to
take a superposition,

1568
01:01:43,985 --> 01:01:45,620
an arbitrary
superposition of energy

1569
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,974
Eigenfunctions, and find
the corresponding solution

1570
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:49,140
to the Schrodinger equation.

1571
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,540
What this means is, we can take
an arbitrary initial condition

1572
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,990
and compute the full solution
of the Schrodinger equation.

1573
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:00,770
All we have to do is figure out
what these coefficients Cn are.

1574
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,300
Everyone cool with that?

1575
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,950
So, we have thus, using
superposition and energy

1576
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,280
Eigenvalues, totally solved
the Schrodinger equation,

1577
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,860
and reduced it to the problem
of finding these expansion

1578
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,530
coefficients.

1579
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,850
Meanwhile, these expansion
coefficients have a meaning.

1580
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,510
They correspond
to the probability

1581
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,240
that we measure the
energy to be equal

1582
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,740
to the corresponding
energy E sub n.

1583
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,960
And it's just the norm
squared of that coefficient.

1584
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,380
So those coefficients
mean something.

1585
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,790
And they allow us to
solve the problem.

1586
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:32,850
Cool?

1587
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,940
So this is fairly abstract.

1588
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,540
So let's make it concrete
by looking at some examples.

1589
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,660
So, just as a quick aside.

1590
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,400
This should sound an awful
lot like the Fourier theorem.

1591
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,750
And let me comment on that.

1592
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,245
This statement originally was
about a general observable

1593
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:48,120
and general operator.

1594
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,700
Here I'm talking
about the energy.

1595
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,559
But let's think about a
slightly more special example,

1596
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,600
or more familiar example.

1597
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,766
Let's consider the momentum.

1598
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:57,390
Given the momentum, we can
find a set of Eigenstates.

1599
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,510
What are the set of
good, properly normalized

1600
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,750
Eigenfunctions of momentum?

1601
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,382

1602
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:05,590
What are the Eigenfunctions
of the momentum operator?

1603
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,841
AUDIENCE: E to the ikx.

1604
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:07,930
PROFESSOR: E to the ikx.

1605
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,430
Exactly.

1606
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,940
In particular, one
over 2 pi e to the ikx.

1607
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,160

1608
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,160
So I claim that, for every
different value of k,

1609
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,650
I get a different value of p,
and the Eigenvalue associated

1610
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,450
to this guy is p is
equal to h bar k.

1611
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,477
That's the Eigenvalue.

1612
01:03:25,477 --> 01:03:27,560
And we get that by acting
with the momentum, which

1613
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,600
is h bar upon i, h bar times
derivative with respect to x.

1614
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,225
Derivative with
respect to x pulls down

1615
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:35,230
an ik times the same thing.

1616
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:38,200
H bar multiplies the
k over i, kills the i,

1617
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,470
and leaves us with an overall
coefficient of h bar k.

1618
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,330
This is an Eigenfunction
of the momentum

1619
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:45,740
operator with
Eigenvalue h bar k.

1620
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,600
And that statement
three is the statement

1621
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,000
that an arbitrary
function f of x

1622
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,940
can be expanded
as a superposition

1623
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,790
of all possible
energy Eigenvalues.

1624
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,200
But k is continuously
valued and the momentum,

1625
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,850
so that's an integral
dk one over 2 pi,

1626
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,150
e to the ikx times
some coefficients.

1627
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,042
And those coefficients
are labeled by k,

1628
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:10,500
but since k is continuous, I'm
going to call it a function.

1629
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,791
And just to give it a name,
instead of calling C sub k,

1630
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:15,530
I'll call it f tilde of k.

1631
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,180
This is of exactly
the same form.

1632
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:22,110
Here is the expansion--
there's the Eigenfunction, here

1633
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,940
is the Eigenfunction, here
is the expansion coefficient,

1634
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,250
here is expansion coefficient.

1635
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,490
And this has a familiar name.

1636
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,280
It's the Fourier theorem.

1637
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,740
So, we see that
the Fourier theorem

1638
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,948
is this statement, statement
three, the superposition

1639
01:04:33,948 --> 01:04:37,700
principal, for the
momentum operator.

1640
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,502
We also see that it's true
for the energy operator.

1641
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,210
And what we're claiming
here is that it's

1642
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,320
true for any observable.

1643
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,260
Given any observable, you
can find its Eigenfunctions,

1644
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,410
and they form a basis on the
space of all good functions,

1645
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,310
and an arbitrary function can
be expanded in that basis.

1646
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:58,785
So, as a last example,
consider the following.

1647
01:04:58,785 --> 01:04:59,535
We've done energy.

1648
01:04:59,535 --> 01:05:00,368
We've done momentum.

1649
01:05:00,368 --> 01:05:02,240
What's another
operator we care about?

1650
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,620
What about position?

1651
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,661
What are the
Eigenfunctions of position?

1652
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:12,640
Well, x hat on
Delta of x minus y

1653
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:18,547
is equal to y Delta x minus y.

1654
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,880
So, these are the states with
definite value of position

1655
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,600
x is equal to y.

1656
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,020
And the reason this is true
is that when x is equal to y,

1657
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,320
x is the operator that
multiplies by the variable x.

1658
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,610
But it's zero, except
at x is equal to y,

1659
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:35,100
so we might as well
replace x by y.

1660
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,500
So, there are the
Eigenfunctions.

1661
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,000
And this statement
is a statement

1662
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,875
that we can represent
an arbitrary function f

1663
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:43,515
of x in a superposition of
these states of definite x.

1664
01:05:43,515 --> 01:05:47,170
f of x is equal to the integral
over all possible expansion

1665
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:51,920
coefficients dy delta x
minus y times some expansion

1666
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,420
coefficient.

1667
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,069
And what's the
expansion coefficient?

1668
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:56,360
It's got to be a function of y.

1669
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,870
And what function
of y must it be?

1670
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,430

1671
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,000
Just f of y.

1672
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,240
Because this integral
against this delta function

1673
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,537
had better give me f of x.

1674
01:06:06,537 --> 01:06:08,411
And that will only be
true if this is f of x.

1675
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:11,060

1676
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,994
So here we see, in some
sense, the definition

1677
01:06:12,994 --> 01:06:13,910
of the delta function.

1678
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,702
But really, this is a statement
of the superposition principle,

1679
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:18,660
the statement that any
function can be expanded

1680
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,210
as a superposition of
Eigenfunctions of the position

1681
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,300
operator.

1682
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,620
Any function can be
expanded as a superposition

1683
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,830
of Eigenfunctions of momentum.

1684
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,630
Any function can be
expanded as a superposition

1685
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,780
of Eigenfunctions of energy.

1686
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,910
Any function can be
expanded as a superposition

1687
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:40,110
of Eigenfunctions of any
operator of your choice.

1688
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:40,950
OK?

1689
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,650
The special cases-- the Fourier
theorem, the general cases,

1690
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,170
the superposition postulate.

1691
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,660
Cool?

1692
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,930
Powerful tool.

1693
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,640
And we've used
this powerful tool

1694
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,550
to write down a general
expression for a solution

1695
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,050
to the Schrodinger equation.

1696
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,060
That's good.

1697
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,156
That's progress.

1698
01:06:58,156 --> 01:06:59,780
So let's look at some
examples of this.

1699
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,957

1700
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:03,790
I can leave this up.

1701
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:07,900
So, our first example is going
to be for the free particle.

1702
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,720
So, a particle whose
energy operator

1703
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,870
has no potential whatsoever.

1704
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:16,960
So the energy operator
is going to be

1705
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,340
just equal to p squared upon 2m.

1706
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,060

1707
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,880
Kinetic energy.

1708
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,100
Yeah.

1709
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,030
AUDIENCE: When you say
any wave function can

1710
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:29,925
be expanded in terms of--

1711
01:07:29,925 --> 01:07:31,300
PROFESSOR: Energy
Eigenfunctions,

1712
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,430
position Eigenfunctions,
momentum Eigenfunctions--

1713
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,350
AUDIENCE: Eigenbasis,
does the Eigenbasis

1714
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:38,565
have to come from an operator
corresponding to an observable?

1715
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:39,190
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1716
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,690
Absolutely.

1717
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,106
I'm starting with
that assumption.

1718
01:07:41,106 --> 01:07:42,420
AUDIENCE: OK.

1719
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,590
PROFESSOR: So, again,
this is a first pass

1720
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,720
of the axioms of
quantum mechanics.

1721
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,492
We'll make this more precise,
and we'll make it more general,

1722
01:07:50,492 --> 01:07:52,950
later on in the course, as we
go through a second iteration

1723
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,660
of this.

1724
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,280
And there we'll talk about
exactly what we need,

1725
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,160
and what operators are
appropriate operators.

1726
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,201
But for the moment, the
sufficient and physically

1727
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:00,850
correct answer is,
operators correspond

1728
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,070
to each observable values.

1729
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:02,569
Yeah.

1730
01:08:02,569 --> 01:08:05,150
AUDIENCE: So are the set of
all reasonable wave functions

1731
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:07,320
in the vector space
that is the same

1732
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,674
as the one with
the Eigenfunctions?

1733
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,340
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent question.

1734
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,322
In general, no.

1735
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,280
So here's the question.

1736
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,470
The question is,
look, if this is true,

1737
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,100
shouldn't it be that the
Eigenfunctions, since they're

1738
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,660
our basis for the
good functions,

1739
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,430
are inside the space of
reasonable functions,

1740
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,430
they should also be
reasonable functions, right?

1741
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,710
Because if you're going
to expand-- for example,

1742
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:29,819
consider two dimensional
vector space.

1743
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,235
And you want to
say any vector can

1744
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:34,990
be expanded in a basis of pairs
of vectors in two dimensions,

1745
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,176
like x and y.

1746
01:08:36,176 --> 01:08:38,300
You really want to make
sure that those vectors are

1747
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,341
inside your vector space.

1748
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:41,250
But if you say this
vector in this space

1749
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,580
can be expanded in terms
of two vectors, this vector

1750
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,400
and that vector, you're
in trouble, right?

1751
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,774
That's not going
to work so well.

1752
01:08:47,774 --> 01:08:50,024
So you want to make sure
that your vectors, your basis

1753
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,819
vectors, are in the space.

1754
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:55,069
For position, the basis
vector's a delta function.

1755
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:58,130
Is that a smooth, continuous
normalizable function?

1756
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,930
No.

1757
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,029
For momentum, the
basis functions

1758
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:03,200
are plane waves that
extend off to infinity

1759
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,399
and have support everywhere.

1760
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:08,020
Is that a normalizable
reasonable function?

1761
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,520
No.

1762
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,634
So, both of these
sets are really bad.

1763
01:09:10,634 --> 01:09:13,300
So, at that point you might say,
look, this is clearly nonsense.

1764
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,550
But here's an important thing.

1765
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,029

1766
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:18,695
So this is a totally
mathematical aside,

1767
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:19,840
and for those of you who
don't care about the math,

1768
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,689
don't worry about it.

1769
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,050
Well, these guys
don't technically

1770
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,841
live in the space of
non-stupid functions--

1771
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:27,800
reasonable, smooth,
normalizable functions.

1772
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,050
What you can show is that
they exist in the closure,

1773
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:33,700
in the completion of that space.

1774
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,550
OK?

1775
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:38,439
So, you can find a
sequence of wave functions

1776
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,970
that are good wave functions,
an infinite sequence,

1777
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,238
that eventually that
infinite sequence converges

1778
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:45,029
to these guys, even
though these are silly.

1779
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:47,090
So, for example, for the
position Eigenstates,

1780
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:50,398
the delta function is not a
continuous smooth function.

1781
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:51,439
It's not even a function.

1782
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,540
Really, it's some god- awful
thing called a distribution.

1783
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,360
It's some horrible thing.

1784
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,485
It's the thing that tells
you, give it an integral,

1785
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:57,800
it'll give you a number.

1786
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,722
Or a function.

1787
01:09:59,722 --> 01:10:01,180
But how do we build
this as a limit

1788
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,513
of totally reasonable functions?

1789
01:10:02,513 --> 01:10:03,960
We've already done that.

1790
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,670
Take this function with
area one, and if you want,

1791
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,230
you can round this out by
making it hyperbolic tangents.

1792
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,190
OK?

1793
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,360
We did it on one of
the problem sets.

1794
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,360
And then just make it
more narrow and more tall.

1795
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,901
And keep making it more narrow
and more tall, and more narrow

1796
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:19,930
and more tall, keeping
its area to be one.

1797
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:24,190
And I claim that eventually
that series, that sequence

1798
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,340
of functions, converges
to the delta function.

1799
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,430
So, while this function is
not technically in our space,

1800
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,600
it's in the completion
of our space,

1801
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,290
in the sense that we take a
series and they converge to it.

1802
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,715
And that's what you need for
this theorem to work out.

1803
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:38,590
That's what you need
for the Fourier theorem.

1804
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,470
And in some sense,
that observation

1805
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,070
was really the
genius of Fourier,

1806
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,571
understanding that
that could be done.

1807
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:46,070
That was totally
mathematical aside.

1808
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,180
But that answer your question?

1809
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:47,480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1810
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,330
PROFESSOR: OK.

1811
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:49,891
Every once in a
while I can't resist

1812
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:51,390
talking about these
sort of details,

1813
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,515
because I really like them.

1814
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:56,350
But it's good to know that
stupid things like this

1815
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,930
can't matter for
us, and they don't.

1816
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:01,820
But it's a very good question.

1817
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,920
If you're confused about
some mathematical detail,

1818
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,970
no matter how elementary, ask.

1819
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,410
If you're confused, someone
else the room is also confused.

1820
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,350
So please don't hesitate.

1821
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,990
OK, so our first example's
going to be the free particle.

1822
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:17,820
And this operator can be
written in a nice way.

1823
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,980
We can write it as minus--
so p is h bar upon iddx,

1824
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,550
so this line is
minus h bar squared

1825
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:27,434
upon 2m to the derivative
with respect to x.

1826
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:28,600
There's the energy operator.

1827
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,550

1828
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,750
So, we want to solve
for the wave functions.

1829
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,670
So let's solve it
using an expansion

1830
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,660
in terms of energy
Eigenfunctions.

1831
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,243
So what are the
energy Eigenfunctions?

1832
01:11:40,243 --> 01:11:45,280
We want to find the
functions E on Phi sub E

1833
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,007
such that this is
equal to-- whoops.

1834
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:47,840
That's not a vector.

1835
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:54,510
That's a hat-- such as this is
equal to a number E Phi sub E.

1836
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,290
But given this
energy operator, this

1837
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:00,950
says that minus h bar squared
over 2m-- whoops, that's a 2.

1838
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:10,060
2m-- Phi prime prime of
x is equal to E Phi of x.

1839
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:18,240
Or equivalently, Phi prime
prime of x plus 2me over h bar

1840
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,720
squared Phi of x
is equal to zero.

1841
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:27,140

1842
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:30,280
So I'm just going to
call 2me-- because it's

1843
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,030
annoying to write it
over and over again--

1844
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,460
over h bar squared.

1845
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,170
Well, first off,
what are its units?

1846
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,810
What are the units
of this coefficient?

1847
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:36,770
Well, you could do it two ways.

1848
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,770
You could either do dimensional
analysis of each thing here,

1849
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:41,228
or you could just know that we
started with a dimensionally

1850
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:42,910
sensible equation,
and this has units

1851
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:46,160
of this divided by length twice.

1852
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,182
So this must have to
whatever length squared.

1853
01:12:48,182 --> 01:12:49,640
So I'm going to
call this something

1854
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,130
like k squared,
something that has

1855
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,504
units of one over
length squared.

1856
01:12:52,504 --> 01:12:54,940

1857
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,410
And the general
solution of this is

1858
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:02,750
that phi E E of x-- well, this
is a second order differential

1859
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,240
equation that will have two
solutions with two expansion

1860
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:15,960
coefficients-- A e to the ikx
plus B e to the minus iks.

1861
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,070
A state with definite momentum
and definite negative momentum

1862
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:26,736
where such that E is equal to h
bar squared k squared upon 2m.

1863
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:30,720
And we get that just from this.

1864
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:36,386
So, this is the solution of the
energy Eigenfunction equation.

1865
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:37,510
Just a note of terminology.

1866
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,950
People sometimes
call the equation

1867
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,984
determining an energy
Eigenfunction-- the energy

1868
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,400
Eigenfunction
equation-- sometimes

1869
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,110
that's refer to as the
Schrodinger equation.

1870
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:48,060
That's a sort of cruel
thing to do to language,

1871
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,380
because the Schrodinger's
equation is about time

1872
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:54,500
evolution, and this equation
is about energy Eigenfunctions.

1873
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,670
Now, it's true that energy
Eigenfunctions evolve

1874
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:00,151
in a particularly simple
way under time evolution,

1875
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:01,400
but it's a different equation.

1876
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,890
This is telling you about
energy Eigenstates, OK?

1877
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:07,370

1878
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,170
And then more
discussion of this is

1879
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:12,100
done in the notes, which I will
leave aside for the moment.

1880
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,250
But I want to do one more
example before we take off.

1881
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,384
Wow.

1882
01:14:16,384 --> 01:14:18,300
We got through a lot
less than expected today.

1883
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,410

1884
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,190
And the one last example
is the following.

1885
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,085
It's a particle
in a box And this

1886
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,500
is going to be important
for your problem sets,

1887
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,833
so I'm going to go ahead and
get this one out of the way

1888
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,620
as quickly as possible.

1889
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,680
So, example two.

1890
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,130

1891
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,290
Particle in a box.

1892
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:40,979

1893
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:42,520
So, what I mean by
particle in a box.

1894
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,551
I'm going to take a system
that has a deep well.

1895
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,550
So what I'm drawing here
is the potential energy

1896
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:55,130
U of x, where this is
some energy E naught,

1897
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,270
and this is the
energy zero, and this

1898
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,330
is the position x
equals zero, and this

1899
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,724
is position x equals l.

1900
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,640
And I'm going to idealize
this by saying look,

1901
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,300
I'm going to be interested
in low energy physics,

1902
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,030
so I'm going to just treat
this as infinitely deep.

1903
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,770
And meanwhile, my
life is easier if I

1904
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,180
don't think about curvy
bottoms but I just

1905
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,730
think about things
as being constant.

1906
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:16,460
So, my idealization
is going to be

1907
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:22,030
that the well is
infinitely high and square.

1908
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:27,630
So out here the
potential is infinite,

1909
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:29,205
and in here the
potential is zero.

1910
01:15:29,205 --> 01:15:32,630
U equals inside, between
zero and l for x.

1911
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:36,270

1912
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,310
So that's my system
particle in a box.

1913
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,987
So, let's find the
energy Eigenfunctions.

1914
01:15:40,987 --> 01:15:42,945
And again, it's the same
differential equations

1915
01:15:42,945 --> 01:15:43,444
as before.

1916
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:47,264

1917
01:15:47,264 --> 01:15:49,430
So, first off, before we
even solve anything, what's

1918
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:51,820
the probability that I
find x less than zero,

1919
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:58,822
or find the particle
at x greater than l?

1920
01:15:58,822 --> 01:15:59,735
AUDIENCE: Zero.

1921
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:01,360
PROFESSOR: Right,
because the potential

1922
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,770
is infinitely large out there.

1923
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,650
It's just not going to happen.

1924
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:04,810
If you found it there,
that would correspond

1925
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,590
to a particle of
infinite energy,

1926
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,180
and that's not going to happen.

1927
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,770
So, our this tells
us effectively

1928
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:12,530
the boundary
condition Psi of x is

1929
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,200
equal to zero outside the box.

1930
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,984

1931
01:16:16,984 --> 01:16:18,400
So all we have to
do is figure out

1932
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,077
what the wave function is inside
the box between zero and l.

1933
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,910
And meanwhile, what
must be true of the wave

1934
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,934
function at zero and at l?

1935
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:27,850
It's got to actually
vanish at the boundaries.

1936
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,830
So this gives us boundary
conditions outside the box

1937
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:35,914
and at the boundaries x
equals zero, x equals l.

1938
01:16:35,914 --> 01:16:40,570

1939
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:43,310
But, what's our differential
equation inside the box?

1940
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,470
Inside the box, well,
the potential is zero.

1941
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,410
So the equation is the
same as the equation

1942
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,950
for a free particle.

1943
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:51,540
It's just this guy.

1944
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,900
And we know what
the solutions are.

1945
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,150
So the solutions can be
written in the following form.

1946
01:16:56,150 --> 01:17:01,780
Therefore inside the
wave function-- whoops.

1947
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,490
Let me write this as
Phi sub E-- Phi sub

1948
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,390
E is a superposition of two.

1949
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,220
And instead of writing
it as exponentials,

1950
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,800
I'm going to write it
as sines and cosines,

1951
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,190
because you can express
them in terms of each other.

1952
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:23,030
Alpha cosine of kx
plus Beta sine of kx,

1953
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:27,950
where again Alpha and Beta
are general complex numbers.

1954
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:33,210
But, we must satisfy the
boundary conditions imposed

1955
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,830
by our potential at x
equals zero and x equals l.

1956
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:38,989
So from x equals
zero, we find that Phi

1957
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:40,280
must vanish when x equals zero.

1958
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,238
When x equals zero, this
is automatically zero.

1959
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:43,520
Sine of zero is zero.

1960
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,820
Cosine of zero is one.

1961
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,630
So that tells us that
Alpha is equal to zero.

1962
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:53,490
Meanwhile, the condition that at
x equals l-- the wave function

1963
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:57,355
must also vanish-- tells us
that-- so this term is gone,

1964
01:17:57,355 --> 01:17:59,700
set off with zero-- this
term, when x is equal to l,

1965
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,580
had better also be zero.

1966
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,630
We can solve that by
setting Beta equal to zero,

1967
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,690
but then our wave
function is just zero.

1968
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,790
And that's a really
stupid wave function.

1969
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,360
So we don't want to do that.

1970
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,776
We don't want to
set Beta to zero.

1971
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:12,840
Instead, what must we do?

1972
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,566
Well, we've got a sine,
and depending on what k is,

1973
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,440
it starts at zero and
it ends somewhere else.

1974
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,810
But we need it hit zero.

1975
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,960
So only for a very
special value of k will

1976
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,400
it actually hit zero
at the end of l.

1977
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,600
We need kl equals zero.

1978
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,170

1979
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,560
Or really, kl is
a multiple of pi.

1980
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,980
Kl is equal-- and we
want it to not be zero,

1981
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:37,880
so I'll call it n plus
1, an integer, times pi.

1982
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,940
Or equivalently, k is equal
to sub n is equal to n plus 1,

1983
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,540
where n goes from zero to any
large positive integer, pi

1984
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:49,500
over l.

1985
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,210
So the energy
Eigenfunction's here.

1986
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:54,711

1987
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:56,710
The energy Eigenfunction
is some normalization--

1988
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:05,940
whoops-- a sub n
sine of k and x.

1989
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:14,470

1990
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,720
And where kn is equal to
this-- and as a consequence,

1991
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,820
E is equal to h bar squared
kn can squared E sub

1992
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:27,160
n is h bar squared kn squared
over 2m, which is equal to h

1993
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:32,860
bar squared-- just plugging
in-- pi squared n plus 1 squared

1994
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,260
over 2ml squared.

1995
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,180

1996
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,860
And what we found is
something really interesting.

1997
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,810
What we found is, first
off, that the wave functions

1998
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:45,170
look like-- well,
the ground state,

1999
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:48,350
the lowest possible energy
there is n equals zero.

2000
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,510
For n equals zero, this is
just a single half a sine wave.

2001
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:52,260
It does this.

2002
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,200
This is the n equals zero state.

2003
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,330
And it has some energy,
which is E zero.

2004
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,820
And in particular, E zero
is not equal to zero.

2005
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:03,905
E zero is equal to h bar squared
pi squared over 2ml squared.

2006
01:20:03,905 --> 01:20:08,784

2007
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:10,450
It is impossible for
a particle in a box

2008
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:14,800
to have an energy lower
than some minimal value E

2009
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,260
naught, which is not zero.

2010
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:21,060
You cannot have less
energy than this.

2011
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,620
Everyone agree with that?

2012
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,990
There is no such Eigenstate
with energy less than this.

2013
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,510
Meanwhile, it's worse.

2014
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:28,540
The next energy is
when n is equal to 1,

2015
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:32,730
because if we decrease
the wavelength or increase

2016
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,010
k a little bit, we get
something that looks like this,

2017
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,810
and that doesn't satisfy
our boundary condition.

2018
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,630
In order to satisfy
our boundary condition,

2019
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,055
we're going to have to
eventually have it cross over

2020
01:20:40,055 --> 01:20:41,640
and get to zero again.

2021
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:47,390
And if I could only draw--
I'll draw it up here--

2022
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:48,480
it looks like this.

2023
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,080
And this has an
energy E one, which

2024
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,750
you can get by
plugging one in here.

2025
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,160
And that differs by one,
two, four, a factor of four

2026
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,230
from this guy.

2027
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:59,110
E one is four E zero.

2028
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,330
And so on and so forth.

2029
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:03,180
The energies are gaped.

2030
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,770
They're spread away
from each other.

2031
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,872
The energies are discrete.

2032
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:09,080
And they get further and
further away from each other

2033
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,640
as we go to higher
and higher energies.

2034
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,180
So this is already
a peculiar fact,

2035
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,087
and we'll explore some of
its consequences later on.

2036
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:19,920
But here's that I want
to emphasize for you.

2037
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,630
Already in the first
most trivial example

2038
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:25,460
of solving a
Schrodinger equation,

2039
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,850
or actually even before
that, just finding the energy

2040
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:31,090
Eigenvalues and the energy of
Eigenfunctions of the simplest

2041
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,575
system you possibly could,
either a free particular,

2042
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,950
or a particle in
a box, a particle

2043
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:38,800
trapped inside a potential
well, what we discovered

2044
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,220
is that the energy
Eigenvalues, the allowed values

2045
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:46,520
of the energy, are discrete, and
that they're greater than zero.

2046
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,522
You can never have zero energy.

2047
01:21:48,522 --> 01:21:49,980
And if that doesn't
sound familiar,

2048
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,340
let me remind you of something.

2049
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:55,380
The spectrum of light coming
off of a gas of hot hydrogen

2050
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,420
is discrete.

2051
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,870
And no one's ever
found a zero energy

2052
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,440
beam of light coming out of it.

2053
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,550
And we're going to make contact
with that experimental data.

2054
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:07,550
That's going to be part
of the job for the rest.

2055
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:08,300
See you next time.

2056
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,270

2057
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:15,220
[APPLAUSE]

2058
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:18,302
