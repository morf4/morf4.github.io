00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,200

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,000
PROFESSOR: OK, so,
we're going to pick up

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,564
on our study of
periodic potentials

12
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:29,980
and our search for
the explanation

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,280
of the physics of solids.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,950
And I want to quickly
remind you of the logic

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,390
we went through last time.

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,470
This is one of the more subtle
bits of logic in the semester,

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,884
so I'm gonna do it
again, a little faster.

18
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:45,050
I'm mostly gonna do it in
a slightly different form.

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,504
I want to think for a moment
about just a free particle,

20
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:49,920
but I want to use
all the language

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,710
and formalism we used for the
periodic potential last time--

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,430
translation operators, the
block wave functions-- I want

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,360
to use all of that for
just a free particle.

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,901
So, first let's just
remind ourselves

25
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,280
how the free
particle story goes.

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,490
So, for a free
particle, by which

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,440
I mean the energy
operator is p squared

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,690
upon 2m, and no
potential, plus 0.

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,977
We have a very important
consequence of being free--

30
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,310
that the energy can be written
as just p squared-- which

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,680
is that the energy commutes
with the momentum operator.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,440
And what this
tells us is that we

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,050
can find a basis of
eigenfunctions which

34
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,580
are common eigenfunctions
of E and p, right?

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,330
We can expand
every wave function

36
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,980
at any arbitrary-- fantastic.

37
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,690
Thank you, sir.

38
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,822

39
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:40,470
Oh!

40
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,170
Brilliant!

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,551
GUEST: Plan A, Plan B.

42
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,550
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

43
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,760
That's an awful huge straw.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,450

45
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,760
Pay no attention to the
device beneath the table.

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,660
So, 'cause you know, it's
quantum mechanics, right?

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,220
Bowl of water--

48
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,780
So, the energy and
momentum commute.

49
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,450
And as a consequence, we can
find a basis of eigenfunctions

50
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,460
exists which are common
eigenfunction of E, E on phi E,

51
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,840
and I'll label k, by
the eigenvalue of k,

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,490
is equal to E phi Ek.

53
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:28,527
And p on phi Ek is
equal to h bar k phi Ek.

54
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,485
You'll notice, of course,
that I don't label it

55
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:31,510
by the eigenvalue,
but I label it

56
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,700
by something that's determined
by the label, the eigenvalue's

57
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,160
determined by the
labels, h bar k.

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,150
Now, here's the thing,
can we allow E and k

59
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,100
to be any values we
want independently?

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,290
Can I make E, 3, and k, 47?

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,650
No.

62
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,280
There's a consistency
relation, which

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,451
involves satisfying the
energy eigenvalue equation.

64
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:52,700
We actually have to find
solutions of these equations.

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,120
And once we find the
solutions are those equations,

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,270
we'll find relations
between k and E.

67
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,000
And in particular,
for a free particle,

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,210
we find that the relation that
we need is E is equal to--

69
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,200
and I will write E sub k--
is equal to h bar squared

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
k squared upon 2m.

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,040
This is also known as
omega is equal to h

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,500
bar k squared upon 2m.

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,630
Just to remind you,
the [INAUDIBLE] E

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,660
is h bar omega, omega sub k.

75
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,680
That's not the thing
I wanted to look at.

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,630
This is.

77
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,340
And when we work
this way, we find

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,470
that the energy eigenvalues,
E, as a function of k,

79
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,650
take a determined form.

80
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,066
And that determined form is
quite simple, it's a parabola.

81
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,630

82
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,750
Everyone cool with that?

83
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,370
So, if you know k, you
know E. But if you know E,

84
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,260
it turns out it's
doubly degenerate.

85
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,520
So, if you know E,
you're one of two k's.

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,170
You could be either
the ikx-- oh, sorry,

87
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,720
and I needed to say-- that
the function, so, from solving

88
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,520
the equation, gave us that
the energy eigenfunctions,

89
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,600
phi Ek are equal to some
normalization 1 over 2

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,165
pi as conventional,
e to the ikx.

91
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,880

92
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,760
OK.

93
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
So, if I tell you
the energy, you

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,004
don't know which momentum
state I'm talking about.

95
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:22,170
But if I tell you the
momentum, you know the energy.

96
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,503
So, there's a little degeneracy.

97
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:26,240
That degeneracy is coming
from the parity symmetry,

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,580
the system, right?

99
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,080
And note that what
we've done here,

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
did we have to write the
wave functions in terms

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,140
of these, the ikxes.

102
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,677
Is there another
basis we could've

103
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,010
used for the energy eigenstates?

104
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,911

105
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:40,410
Yeah.

106
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,600
Because these are
degenerate, we could've

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,724
taken any linear combinations
of E to the ikx and E

108
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,280
to the minus ikx,
and we could have

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,005
got, for example,
sine and cosine.

110
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,380
That would have
had the advantage

111
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,390
that the energy eigenfunctions
would have been pure real,

112
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,889
which is one we
proved was possible.

113
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,580
You can always choose pure
real energy eigenfunctions.

114
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,480
However, it would have had the
disadvantage that these states

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,021
would not-- sine
and cosine-- are not

116
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,330
eigenstates of momentum, right?

117
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,940
It's convenient to work with
common eigenstates of momentum

118
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,140
and energy, so we give up on
having a real wave function

119
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,350
and that's the cost of finding
shared eigenfunctions of energy

120
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,375
and momentum.

121
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,830
Everyone cool?

122
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,791
Any questions?

123
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,290
OK.

124
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,062
So, this is the usual story
for the free particle.

125
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,270
But we learn a couple of
things about it immediately.

126
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,310
Just by eyeballing
the wave function

127
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,310
we see some things to note.

128
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,760
Note, all states-- all
eigenfunctions-- phi sub

129
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,914
E, which are of the
form E to the ikxx--

130
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:37,830
and I'm gonna add the
time dependence in now--

131
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,935
minus omega sum
kt, are extended.

132
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:46,240

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,652
They have equal probability
density everywhere,

134
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,360
and the probability
distribution does not

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,324
fall off to 0 as we go far away.

136
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:53,990
And so, what this
tells us we have to do

137
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,620
is we have to build-- if we
want to study real localized

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,760
states that are normalizable--
we have to build

139
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:09,610
wave packets of the form psi
is equal to integral dk sum

140
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:18,110
overall momentum modes f of k E
to the ikx minus omega t sub k.

141
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,630
Where this f we will generally
take-- although we don't have

142
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,680
to take, to be a real function--
but, is peaked at some k0.

143
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,955

144
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,580
So, this is what we did when we
studied the evolution of a wave

145
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,120
packet of this form.

146
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,875
But in particular,
such wave packets

147
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,250
have a couple of
nice properties.

148
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,849
The first property
we've studied.

149
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,390
And if you're not
totally comfortable

150
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,610
with the idea of group
velocity, you really

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,545
need to go over it again.

152
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:45,711
It's be an excellent thing
to show up in recitation,

153
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,080
for example, stationary phase.

154
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,090
So, the group velocity
of such a wave packet--

155
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,080
as long as it's of this form and
peaked around a single momentum

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,970
value, k0-- the group velocity
is d omega dk evaluated at k0,

157
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,830
at the peak value
of the distribution.

158
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,750
And note, I wanna
just quickly note

159
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,960
that this is equal
for the free particle.

160
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,976
Omega is h bar k
squared upon 2m,

161
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:13,100
take a derivative with
respect to k, the 2 cancels.

162
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,465
We get h bar k upon m.

163
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:18,280

164
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,500
Which notably, is equal
to the expectation

165
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,730
value of the momentum
over the mass.

166
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,860
Everyone cool with that?

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,770
So, this gives us a
nice way to, by the way,

168
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,370
if you didn't know the mass, but
you could measure the system,

169
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,950
for example, you can compute
on average the momentum,

170
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,616
and you could compute
the group velocity

171
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,170
by watching wave
packets move, this

172
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,020
is a nifty way to
compute the mass.

173
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,610
The mass can be given by,
well, put the mass up here,

174
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,090
and divide by the
group velocity.

175
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,390
Measure the momentum and
divide by the group velocity.

176
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,970
OK, so, I can take
this, and notice,

177
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,950
that this just exactly
gives me the mass.

178
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,780
So, this is a way
to, given a system

179
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,760
with a momentum and
a group velocity,

180
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,750
I can compute an effective mass.

181
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,761
Which for the free
particle, is just the mass.

182
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,260
Cool?

183
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,922
Just a side observation.

184
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:04,630
But this is all a
consequence of the fact

185
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,240
that we have wave
packets of this form.

186
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,150
Their plane waves, or
at least things that

187
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,090
have a phase, times what could
be a real-- though it could

188
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,790
but an overall phase on the
whole thing-- a real function,

189
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,370
which is peaked at a
particular value of k0.

190
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,170
Usual wave packet story.

191
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,651
Any questions?

192
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:23,150
Good.

193
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,270
So, this should all
be pretty familiar.

194
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,824
Now, here's the
thing, when we talk

195
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,240
about a periodic
potential, what I

196
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,656
want to do next
is, I want to talk

197
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,800
about a periodic potential.

198
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,190
So, now, we have a system
that has maybe steps,

199
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,304
and it's periodic,
with period l, OK?

200
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:38,970
And then, ditto.

201
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,030

202
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,987
It's gonna be periodic.

203
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,820
And I want to run through
the same analysis.

204
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,528
I want to find the
energy eigenfunctions.

205
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,721
I want to organize
them in a nice way.

206
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,720
And in particular, I want
to know the following,

207
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,320
if this is equal to
v of x, and v of x,

208
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,670
and I call the
energy operator E sub

209
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,570
g is equal to p squared upon
2m plus a coefficient, g,

210
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,482
times-- let me call
it g sub 0, just

211
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,090
to make it unambiguous--
times v of x.

212
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,130
Notice that when g0 is 0, this
is just the free particle.

213
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,860
I added a periodic
potential times 0.

214
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,330
That is stupid, but doable.

215
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,570
But as I slowly turn on
g0, what's going to happen?

216
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,900
The energy eigenfunctions
are going to slowly change.

217
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,280
And the energy eigenvalues
are going to slowly change.

218
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,821
And the actual system we care
about has some actual value of,

219
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,380
you know, like 7,
or e, or whatever.

220
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,680
But this is a way to
connect the free particle

221
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,194
to the particle in a
periodic potential.

222
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,610
You know, and if you just turn
on a little weak potential,

223
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,609
you don't expect the
system to radically change.

224
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:46,292
So, one way to organize the
question of periodic potentials

225
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,750
is, what happens
as you slowly turn

226
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,170
on this periodic potential?

227
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,290
But here's the first
thing I want to notice,

228
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,748
the first thing I
want to notice is

229
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,620
that it's no longer true
that the energy commutes

230
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,370
with the momentum.

231
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,910

232
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,050
So, it would be silly to
try to organize our wave

233
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,620
functions in terms of energy
eigenfunctions, which are also

234
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,840
momentum eigenfunctions.

235
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,589
Because that will only
be a sensible thing

236
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,400
to do when this
interaction term--

237
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,490
when this potential--
is 0, right?

238
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,940
So, instead, I want
to organize them

239
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,110
in terms of energy eigenvalues
and any other operator that

240
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,560
commutes with the
energy eigenfunction.

241
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,420
In particular, this
is not invariant

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,090
under arbitrarily
translations, which

243
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,320
it would have to be to be
invariant to conserve momentum.

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
But it is invariant
under translations by L.

245
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,970
And as a consequence, we
have that the energy operator

246
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,130
commutes with translations by
L. Where translations by L.

247
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,890
Takes a function and
shifts it over by L.

248
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,401
And so, because translations
by L as we showed in a problem

249
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,817
set long ago commutes with p
squared, because this is just

250
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:50,720
an exponential of Lp, with
coefficients, with an i

251
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,580
and an h bar.

252
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,940
And because the potential is
invariant under shifting by l,

253
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,170
and so it commutes
with TL, this is 0.

254
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,180
So, what this tells us is we
can find common eigenfunctions.

255
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,920

256
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,760
In fact, a common
eigenbasis of E and TL.

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,640
And here's the thing
that's nice about this,

258
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,015
I could've made this argument
whether the potential was 0

259
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:18,830
or not.

260
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,480
For the free particle,
it's also true

261
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,270
that the system commutes
with translations by l.

262
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,651
It's free, there
is no potential.

263
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,150
It sort of silly,
because I could've

264
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,340
just used the momentum.

265
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,180
But let's see what
happens if we use

266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,400
the translate by l operator.

267
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,821
Everyone cool with that?

268
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,570
So, we want to find
common eigenfunctions.

269
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,570

270
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,570
So, as you guys showed
on a problem set,

271
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,760
the eigenfunctions of TL--
so, in order to do this,

272
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,260
what are the
eigenfunctions of TL?--

273
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,420
you showed that the
eigenfunctions of TL must take

274
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:54,760
the form-- sorry-- phi sub q
of x is equal to E to the iqx

275
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,800
times u of x, for some
q where q is-- where u--

276
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,982
is a real periodic-- I
don't really need the real,

277
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,440
but it's going to
simplify my life,

278
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,190
so I'll take it to be
real-- periodic function.

279
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,297

280
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:14,880
Well, let's just
drop real altogether,

281
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
because we don't need that.

282
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,440
We'll use a periodic function,
and phi of q is this phase.

283
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,890
It times the periodic function.

284
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,780
So in particular,
phi is not periodic.

285
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,890
And as a consequence, TL
on phi q is equal to E

286
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,480
to the iqL phi q,
because this guy shifts,

287
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,569
and this is invariant periodic.

288
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,110
So, this is the
form-- general form--

289
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,776
of the eigenfunctions
of translate by l.

290
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:44,650

291
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,462
And periodic means that u of
x plus l is equal to u of x,

292
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:51,330
just be to explicit.

293
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,050
OK.

294
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,810
So, what this tells us is that
the energy eigenfunctions can

295
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:11,130
be put in a form-- can be
organized-- as phi sub Eq,

296
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,240
such that E acting on phi sub
Eq is equal to E phi sub Eq.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,290

298
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,150
Just like this line, phi sub Eq.

299
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:31,585
And TL phi Eq is equal
to E to the iqL phi Eq.

300
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:32,960
And it's just
saying then we have

301
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,180
common eigenfunctions,
yeah, with energy E

302
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,632
and TL eigenvalue, q.

303
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:37,548
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

304
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:41,380

305
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,020
PROFESSOR: No, because
under translation by l,

306
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,590
this x goes to x plus l.

307
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,325
Oh, I've slightly
changed notation

308
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,450
from earlier in the course.

309
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:48,991
You're right.

310
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:49,960
I've slightly switched.

311
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,370
So, ah!

312
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:51,870
Good.

313
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,790
So, yes.

314
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,130
So, thank you.

315
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,490
So, let's fix notation.

316
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,040
TL takes f of x
to f of x minus l,

317
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,630
is what we've used
previously, right?

318
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,880
But I'm going to just switch
notation, and call this x

319
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,420
plus l.

320
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,860
So, for all the
notes in here, this

321
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,959
is x plus L. Yeah, it doesn't
really make a difference,

322
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,250
you just have to be consistent.

323
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,420
And you're right, I
switched between lecture--

324
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,990
what was it?--
eight, and this one.

325
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,050
Sorry about that.

326
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,870
Yeah, good catch.

327
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,240
Thank you for pointing that out.

328
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,000
So, in which case, this
shifts by x to x plus l.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,370
And we get E to the iqL.

330
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:27,910
Good catch.

331
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,870

332
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,920
Good.

333
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,670
So, again, we have
this property that we

334
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,961
can find common eigenfunctions.

335
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:39,350
However, can E and q be
specified independently?

336
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,350
We know on general
grounds that it's

337
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,900
possible to find
eigenfunctions which

338
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,377
are common eigenfunctions,
because these guys commute--

339
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:47,710
E and TL commute-- so we can
find common eigenfunctions.

340
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,270
And here they are.

341
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,811
And, meanwhile, we know that
the form of these eigenfunctions

342
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:51,830
is of this form.

343
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,430
Because any
eigenfunction of TL is of

344
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,047
this form, a phase times
a periodic functions.

345
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:58,880
Does that, by itself,
tell us a relationship

346
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,600
between the eigenvalues E and q?

347
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,600

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,420
No, right?

349
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,190
Just like E and k
were independent,

350
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,240
until we solved the actual
eigenvalue equations, right?

351
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,580
And it required things
like regularity,

352
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,540
and no similarities.

353
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,570
So, what we have to
do at this point,

354
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,580
is solve the differential
equations for continuity,

355
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,087
periodicity, and solving the
energy eigenvalue equations.

356
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:28,670
And when we solve
the equations, we'll

357
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:36,650
get a relationship
between E and q.

358
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,960

359
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,810
And in particular,
if we do that,

360
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:52,420
here-- do I want
to do it this way?

361
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,830
Yes.

362
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,290
So, in particular for--
write this in the following

363
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:08,390
way-- for g equals 0-- g0 equls
0, which is a free particle--

364
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:16,230
we find E is equal
to h bar squared

365
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,270
q squared E sub q is equal to h
bar squared q squared upon 2m.

366
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,880
And yeah, and the wave
functions are of the form phi

367
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,880
sub qE are equal to some
normalization, 1 over 2 pi,

368
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,400
times E to the iqx.

369
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,940
And the coefficient
function, u, is

370
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,400
just constant, which is nice.

371
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,210
So, times constant.

372
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,180

373
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,810
And so, this is reassuring
because it's exactly

374
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,550
the same form of
the wave functions,

375
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,602
with exactly the same
form of the energy.

376
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,310
But where here, the
label-- the value-- q

377
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:03,620
is representing the
possible value of-- it's

378
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,880
controlling the
eigenvalue of TL.

379
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,547
So, there was a question?

380
00:17:07,547 --> 00:17:08,130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

381
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,079
PROFESSOR: Yes?

382
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,452
AUDIENCE: So, for the
translation operator--

383
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:13,416
PROFESSOR: Yes?

384
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,826
AUDIENCE: --that
E iqx equal to x

385
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:20,342
will work for any complex q in
any u with period [INAUDIBLE]?

386
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:21,800
Or any periodic u
with [INAUDIBLE]?

387
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,970
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
although, if q is complex,

388
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,619
then this is badly
non-normalizable.

389
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,792
Because if q has
an imaginary part,

390
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,250
then that function
is gonna diverge

391
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,500
in one direction or the other.

392
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,090
So, q had better be real.

393
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,370
But, that's correct.

394
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,160
This works for--
this expression--

395
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,070
A function of this form, a
periodic function-- periodic,

396
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,660
with period L-- times
an E to the iqx,

397
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,420
for any real value q,
and any periodic u,

398
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,898
will be an eigenfunction
of TL, translation.

399
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,007
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

400
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:50,590
PROFESSOR: No.

401
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,560
It's not just non-hermitian.

402
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,200
It's, in fact, unitary.

403
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,950
I mean, what exactly
is your question?

404
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,116
Sorry, I'm misunderstanding.

405
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:00,366
AUDIENCE: So, I mean, just
the translation operator

406
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:05,400
has a really, really large
number of eigenfunctions?

407
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,010
PROFESSOR: Indeed, it does.

408
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,370
And that number is
the same as the number

409
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,420
of momentum eigenfunctions.

410
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,160
Because they can be
both used as a basis.

411
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,290
They're both operators whose
eigenfunctions form a basis.

412
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,024
That's exactly right.

413
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,440
So, I think the
difficult thing is

414
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,030
to think that--
we have a tendency

415
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,192
to think that there
aren't very many momentum

416
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,150
functions, for example.

417
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,900
But there's enough
momentum eigenfunctions

418
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,950
to be complete basis.

419
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:39,424
So, if this seems like a
vastly larger set, then yeah.

420
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:40,420
Indeed.

421
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,040
OK.

422
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,821
So, when we do our analysis for
the free particle of this form,

423
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,070
we get exactly the same story.

424
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,486
And I want to point out a
couple of consequences for this.

425
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:52,090
Working with this TL
operation-- or working with TL

426
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,880
eigenfunctions--- we have
exactly the same properties.

427
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,670
Our eigenfunctions
are, again, extended.

428
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,917
We have to use wave packets.

429
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,000
And those wave packets
move with a group velocity,

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,970
which is given by d omega dk.

431
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,890
On the other hand, here, when
we write super positions,

432
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,223
our general wave function--
our general wave pack, which

433
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm gonna write
here-- psi, is gonna

434
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,834
be of the form integral
dq of E to the iqx

435
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:26,751
u of x times some f of x--
or sorry, f of q-- u sub q.

436
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,580

437
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,250
So, as long as this is a
periodic function, then

438
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,742
the-- oh, and I should
say minus omega sub qt,

439
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,950
to get the time dependence
in there-- as long as this

440
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,110
is a nice periodic function,
especially for this case

441
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,568
was, when it's real, and this
is a sharply peaked function,

442
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,960
which is sharply
peaked around some q0,

443
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:55,230
then we will find that the group
velocity is, again, the omega,

444
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,149
now dq, evaluated at
the peak value, q0.

445
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,690
And that's just a
general consequence

446
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,880
of this form of our wave packet.

447
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,120
As I encourage the
recitation searchers

448
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,290
to review by stationary
phase in recitation.

449
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,000
And secondly, again, we
can find this nice notion

450
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,230
of a mass, which
is the expectation

451
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,922
value of the momentum divided
by the group velocity.

452
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,880
And, again, this, for
our simple free particle,

453
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,796
this is just a nice way
of measuring the mass,

454
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:35,350
if you happen to want to do
so for your free particle.

455
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,860
No one told you the mass.

456
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,660
Everyone cool with that?

457
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,860
OK.

458
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,952
Questions?

459
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:42,452
Yeah?

460
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:46,120
AUDIENCE: Is that still the
momentum when we have g0

461
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,060
is not equal to 0?

462
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,310
PROFESSOR: Excellent question!

463
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,071
So, now, let's study the
case with g0 not equal to 0.

464
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,570
OK?

465
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,105
So, so far we looked at for g0
no equal to-- or g not equal

466
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,820
to 0-- that was just this line.

467
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,990
But everything else,
was for general case

468
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,020
of studying common
eigenfunctions of E and TL.

469
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,210
So, now, let's
study the case for

470
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,890
an actual periodic potential.

471
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:11,440
So, in particular, repeat
for g0 not equal to 0.

472
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,420
And this is the analysis
we did last time.

473
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,059
We did exactly this analysis.

474
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,850
And we looked for the
common eigenfunctions

475
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,679
of E and translate by L, right?

476
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,470
And we found that the
common eigenfunctions

477
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:28,580
took the form Eq is
equal to E to the iq of x

478
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,330
times some u of x.

479
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,180

480
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,596
And now, we need to find what's
the relationship between E

481
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:36,096
and q?

482
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,739
Are any E and any q allowed?

483
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,280
And do those give
you eigenfunctions?

484
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,752
From the free
particle, we expect

485
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:42,210
that that's certainly
not the case.

486
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,130
On the other hand,
we have a guess

487
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,710
as to what it should look like.

488
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,620
The energy eigenfunction
for-- let me, actually,

489
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:56,650
write this here-- the energy
eigenfunctions and energy

490
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:02,520
eigenvalues, more importantly,
of the free particle organized

491
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,880
in terms of q, we
just immediately

492
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,310
see the energy is just h bar
squared q squared upon 2m.

493
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,644
So, the potential-- or sorry,
the energy as a function of q--

494
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:14,560
is, again, a parabola.

495
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,900

496
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,200
OK, so, here's q, and
here's the energy.

497
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,540
And this is for a
free particle, right?

498
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,320
Free particle.

499
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,877
E equals h bar squared
q squared upon 2m.

500
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:29,710
Now, I want to ask what
happens as we slowly

501
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,160
turn on the potential?

502
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,280
As we take g0 not equal 0.

503
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,836
So, we did this last time.

504
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:36,960
We turned on the potential.

505
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,110
We turned on the
a potential, which

506
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,519
is, in fact, delta functions.

507
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,810
So, now , in order to solve
the differential equations,

508
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,875
we have to actually know
what the potential is.

509
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,340
There's no getting around it.

510
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,090
And so, we took a bunch
of delta functions

511
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,030
with dimensionless strength
g0, and spaced by L.

512
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,460
And what we found was
an equation relating

513
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,920
E and L, which
took the following

514
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,550
form-- and for simplicity, I'm
gonna write E is equal to, this

515
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,780
has nothing to do with
momentum, although it looks

516
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,821
like momentum, I'm just
going to write E formally

517
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:10,430
as h bar squared Scripty
k squared upon 2m-- so, k,

518
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,442
here, should just be
understood as root 2m

519
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:14,900
over h bar squared, which I
hate writing out over, and over

520
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,460
again.

521
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,940
So, let me, actually, write
that the other way around.

522
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,260
Scripty k is equal to the square
root of 2mE upon h bar squared.

523
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:32,270
So, when you see k think E.
When you see lions, think lions.

524
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,090
OK.

525
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,625
So, we found that
the condition--

526
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,750
in order that we solve the
differential equations--

527
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,520
the condition, in order that E
and q label energy eigenstates

528
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,270
which actually are
energy eigenfunctions--

529
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,367
common energy
eigenfunctions-- of the energy

530
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,700
and the translation by operator,
we found that there was

531
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,450
a relation, which
was cosine of qL--

532
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,520
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZE}

533
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,230
PROFESSOR: --is equal to--
Bless you-- cosine of kL plus g0

534
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:05,070
upon 2kL sine kL, right?

535
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,830
So, first off, let's
make sure that this

536
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,077
agrees with what we found
when g0 was equal to 0.

537
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:11,660
When g0 was equal
to 0 we found that E

538
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,801
was equal to h bar squared
q squared for any q.

539
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,050
And, well, when g0 is equal
to 0, this term goes away.

540
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,580
And we get cosine of qL
is equal to cosine of kL.

541
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,060
And an example of a solution
for that is qL is equal to kL.

542
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,700
Or q is equal to k.

543
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,380
In which case, E is equal to h
bar squared k squared upon 2m,

544
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,150
by plugging in that expression.

545
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,690
Cool?

546
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,559
So, this reproduces the
free particle result

547
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,350
when we need it to.

548
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,920

549
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,240
But in general,
it's not the same.

550
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,510
So, what does it look like?

551
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,620
So, let's take a look at that.

552
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:53,250
So, here, first off,
what I'm plotting here

553
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,650
is the plot that we
draw on the board

554
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,900
last time, only here I'm
plotting it here horizontally

555
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,400
is the energy, E, and
vertically is cosine of qL.

556
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,210
Now, for q a real
number, cosine of qL

557
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,620
goes between 1 and negative 1.

558
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,870
And so, any value
in here corresponds

559
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,385
to a valid value of
cosine-- or of q-- sorry.

560
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,890
So, any value, any point,
between 1 and minus 1

561
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,820
is an allowable value of q.

562
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,380
So, for example, this
point, right here,

563
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,940
corresponds to this
value is q, OK?

564
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,880
Just horizontal lines.

565
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,780
Meanwhile, this curve
is the right hand side

566
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,800
of that expression.

567
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,360
It's cosine of kL plus--
or sorry-- in this case,

568
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,730
it's cosine of root
2mE upon h bar squared

569
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,630
L. This right-hand
side plugged in here,

570
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,480
and I'm plotting it as
a function of energy.

571
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,690
Just to be explicit, so this is
energy-- or energy-- and the q.

572
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,070
And here's that curve.

573
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,350
So, for g equals 0-- which is
what I've set it to here-- g

574
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,490
is equal to 0--
that didn't work,

575
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,110
there we go-- when
g is equal to 0,

576
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,490
we see that it goes
between 0, and this is just

577
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,629
cosine of root E. And
there's cosine of root E.

578
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,670
It gets spread out because
it's square root of E,

579
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,040
rather than E. Everyone
cool with that?

580
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,328
And so, here's my question,
what pairs of E and q

581
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,161
correspond to allowed
energy eigenfunctions?

582
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:15,501

583
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,250
How do you look at
this diagram and decide

584
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,220
which values of E and q are
good energy eigenfunctions?

585
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,428
AUDIENCE: Well, the fact
that the boundary conditions

586
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:28,170
of the q is such that cosine of
qL is between negative 1 and 1?

587
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,080
PROFESSOR: Good

588
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
AUDIENCE: Or all
values are allowed?

589
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,240
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

590
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,010
So, let me be explicit.

591
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,540
So, how would I find?

592
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,155
That's exactly right.

593
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:35,280
Let me rephrase that and
be a little more explicit.

594
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,514
So, what we need is we need
a solution of cosine qL

595
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,430
is equal to the right
hand side, in this case,

596
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,592
cosine of root
energy, L. So, that

597
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:45,800
means we need to find a
horizontal line corresponding

598
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,883
to a particular value of
q-- or a particular value

599
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,680
of cosine qL-- and a
point on the curve, cosine

600
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
of root EL, which is this guy.

601
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,160
So, at any point where
we are inside these two

602
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,760
extreme values, and this
E, will give us a value.

603
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,720
So, for example,
for this point-- ah,

604
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,000
I wish I could draw-- for
this point, that corresponds

605
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,110
to a particular
value of q, right?

606
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,360
Where the cosine of q is
equal to that vertical value.

607
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,060
And it corresponds to a
particular value of E.

608
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,785
So, each point, here,
corresponds to a value of E--

609
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,890
an allowed value of
E-- on the horizontal,

610
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,005
and an allowed value of
q, such that cosine qL

611
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,120
is the vertical value.

612
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,280
Everyone cool with that?

613
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,215
So, what val-- Yeah?

614
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:31,015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] p
degeneracy for values of q.

615
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,677
Like for a specific
q, we're going

616
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:36,215
to find a lot of [INAUDIBLE]?

617
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:38,781
PROFESSOR: For specific
values of q, why does it--

618
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,689
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
horizontal line.

619
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,572
You'll have a lot of
intersections, right?

620
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:44,030
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's, excellent.

621
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,240
OK.

622
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,940
So, good.

623
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,144
So, there are two ways
of answering that.

624
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,310
That's a very good question.

625
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,770
So, the question
is, look, this is

626
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,160
slightly funny state of affairs.

627
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,880
If we plot-- if we take a
horizontal line-- corresponding

628
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,540
to a particular value q, it
hits at various different values

629
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,900
of the energy.

630
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,817
Excellent observation.

631
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:00,400
So, let me make two
points about that.

632
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,970
The first point is that when we
defined q, how did we define q?

633
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:11,920
We said the translate be
L on phi Eq was equal to E

634
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,690
to the iqL phi eq.

635
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:23,160
But now, suppose we take q
to q plus 2pi upon L, OK?

636
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,710
OK, so if we take q
to q plus 2pi upon L,

637
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,980
we don't do anything
to the eigenvalue.

638
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
So, that's not enough
to specify which

639
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,714
function we're talking about.

640
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:33,130
Because we changed
the value of q,

641
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,900
and it doesn't change
the eigenvalue.

642
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,691
So, you can't just
focus on the eigenvalue.

643
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:38,240
There are two ways of
thinking about that.

644
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,470
One is, look, since q
and q plus 2 pi upon L

645
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,420
give you the same
eigenvalue of TL,

646
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,250
we should just think
of them as equivalent.

647
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,480
So, one, we should just--
look, any time you have q,

648
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,449
and you add plus 2pi upon L,
you just think of this as q.

649
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:57,240
It's not different.

650
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,230
There's just, you know,
q now is valued periodic.

651
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,090
If you shift q by 2 pi,
you're actually back

652
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,839
at the same point.

653
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,650
So, q is now a
periodic variable.

654
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,395
And but, that's not enough.

655
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,520
Different values of these
q correspond to different

656
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,580
values-- the same eigenvalue.

657
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,890
So, you're getting multiple
solutions as a consequence.

658
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,590
But there's another way
to think about this.

659
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,990
Which is just in
terms of this graph.

660
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:25,560
In terms of this graph,
if what we're specifying

661
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,490
is cosine of qL, but we're not
specifying the value for q,

662
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,140
yeah?

663
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:42,300
So, if we instead plotted
this as a function of q,

664
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:50,610
without assuming q is
equivalent to 2pi q plus 2pi

665
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,210
upon L-- which we can do,
we're perfectly entitled

666
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,490
to do that-- what do we get?

667
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,720

668
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,960
What do you think you get?

669
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,000
For the free particle,
we know exactly what

670
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,320
we get for the free particle.

671
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,900
The parabola.

672
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,275
And if you just take this,
and I'm going to give you guys

673
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,066
the Mathematica files
for all these things.

674
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,310
Yeah, if you just take
this, and open it up,

675
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,310
instead of plotting it
in terms of cosine of qL,

676
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,150
plot it in terms of q,
that's exactly where you get.

677
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,144
The satisfying thing.

678
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:24,310
And I'm going to come back
to that in just a minute,

679
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,685
but it was a really
good question

680
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:27,870
and we'll come back to it.

681
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,050
Other questions?

682
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,380
OK, now, let's ask what
happens as we turn on g0.

683
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,730
As we turn on g0, the
solutions to this equation

684
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,355
are going to be
different, because it's

685
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:40,830
going to be a
difference equation.

686
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,410
So, let's do it.

687
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,035
So, here it is.

688
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,930
We have g0, we can tune it.

689
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,380
And I'm going to
slowly turn on g0.

690
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,020
And watch what happens
to these curves.

691
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,914

692
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:52,330
So, now we see
that the right hand

693
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,480
side of the yellowish curve
is now exceeding 1 and minus 1

694
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,040
in various places, right?

695
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,530
And why is it doing that?

696
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,476
Let's get some
reasonable down here.

697
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:06,600
So, why is it doing that's?

698
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,300
It's doing that because this
can now be greater than 1.

699
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,840
Cosine is bounded between 1
and minus 1, but this is not.

700
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,680

701
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,180
And so, we overshoot
in some places.

702
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,480
And what does this tell us?

703
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,620
What does this
really telling us?

704
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,470
What its really telling
us is that-- there we

705
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,536
go-- how do we find
allowed values of E and q

706
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,660
such that we have a good
energy eigenfunction which

707
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,830
is simultaneously and
eigenfunction of E and of TL?

708
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,880
We need to find points where
a horizontal line between 1

709
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,010
and minus 1 intersects
the right hand side curve.

710
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,320
But for the energies
between here--

711
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,700
this value of the energy, and
this value of the energy---

712
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,390
there is no such point.

713
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,802
The energies in
here-- any energy

714
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:51,010
in here-- in order for those
lines to intersect, line

715
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,350
must be greater than 1, or
less than minus 1 down here,

716
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,480
or here.

717
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,404
So, there's no
allowed value of q,

718
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:01,820
such that there's a solution
with energy between these two

719
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,220
points.

720
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,310
Everyone cool with that?

721
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:11,290
So, that's telling us that
there are values of energy where

722
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,850
there are no energy eigenvalues
with that corresponding energy.

723
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,450
Because there simply
aren't solutions

724
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,440
of this equation for any
value of q with that energy.

725
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,350
On the other hand, when
the right hand side

726
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,430
is between 1 and minus 1, we
have allowed values of energy.

727
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,327
We have a value of
q, and a value of E

728
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:31,410
that correspond to each
other, and they correspond

729
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,860
to a solution of the energy
eigenvalue equation and the TL

730
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,340
eigenvalue equation.

731
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,436
So, let's see what that looks
like in this presentation.

732
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:47,500
Oh, before I do, I want to say
one other thing about this.

733
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,150
Let's take this plot, and
let's use this periodicity.

734
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,970
So, this periodicity is going
to say that-- So, here's

735
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,475
pi upon L, here's minus pi
upon L-- let's see, yeah,

736
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:06,450
good-- there's minus pi
upon L, there's 2pi upon L,

737
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,060
and 2pi upon L. If
these guys are periodic,

738
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,180
than I could've just said,
look, at this point--

739
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,832
this is pi upon L,
and minus pi upon L--

740
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:17,040
I could've said this point
is the same as this point.

741
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,081
So, I could've taken this
whole bit of the curve,

742
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,290
and I could've
moved it over here.

743
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,520
Everyone cool with that?

744
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,100
Because this value of q, is
the same as this value, q.

745
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,329
This value of q, is the same
as this value of q, right?

746
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:30,870
So, I could have written this,
and if we just take this over,

747
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,030
you can see it's,
you know, symmetric.

748
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:41,850
As a consequence,
we get-- And so, we

749
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,610
can write-- we can draw--
this entire parabola folded up

750
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,640
into one region, using the
periodicity with q as 2pi

751
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,020
upon L. And when you fold
it up into one region,

752
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,122
just using q as periodic
with period 2pi over L,

753
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:57,080
and now noting that there
are several solutions

754
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,860
for every value q--
corresponding to how far out

755
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,374
on the parabola
you went-- now we

756
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,790
have a much simpler way of
presenting this, where we don't

757
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,400
need to see the whole parabola.

758
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,980
This is a real advantage.

759
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,310
When we plot things in
this way, the structure

760
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,530
of the energy bands
and energy gaps

761
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,100
becomes considerably
more simple.

762
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,420
So, let me do that.

763
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,600
First let me set the g to 0.

764
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,493
OK, so, here is
our free particle.

765
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,659
And let's look at that plot.

766
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,659
So, here's the plot that
I was just describing.

767
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,120
What you see here,
is the parabola.

768
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,310
And I've use a
periodicity to box it up

769
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,280
into one fundamental period
between pi and minus pi

770
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,020
upon L, OK?

771
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,980
And so, the blue
line corresponds

772
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,155
to the energy as
a function of q--

773
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:43,780
the allowed energy
as a function of q--

774
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,540
and what the green
background represents

775
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,880
is I'm going to put the
horizontal section in green

776
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,139
anytime there's an
allowed energy with that.

777
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,954
So, energy, here,
is vertical, and q

778
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:54,370
is on the horizontal, going
between minus pi over L and pi

779
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,294
over L. Yeah?

780
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,679
AUDIENCE: I might be
getting this just out,

781
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,950
but is there a reason that as
the energy increases the bands

782
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,270
get broader and broader?

783
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,425
Is that just an
artifact of the math,

784
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,900
or is there a good
physical reason for that?

785
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,191
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there're both.

786
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:15,700
So, one way to think about it,
so just purely mathematically,

787
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,510
this is saying that cosine
of qL is cosine of root EL.

788
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,270
So, as we make the energy
larger, and larger,

789
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,780
some small variation
in q is going

790
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,550
to correspond to a
quadratic variation in E.

791
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,330
And that's what's
making it stretched out.

792
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,560
If we plotted this as a
function of kL, instead of E,

793
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,390
then it would have looked
much more constant period, OK?

794
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,120
So, that's the
mathematical answer.

795
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,487
The physical answer is this,
if we have some potential,

796
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,570
if I put you in a finite
well-- So, there you are.

797
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,234
You're in a finite well.

798
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:45,317
And you look at the ceiling,
you're like, damn it!

799
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,130
And so, that's
frustrating, right?

800
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,350
And it's deeply frustrating
if it's a deep well,

801
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,724
but if it's a shallow well,
it's not all that big a deal,

802
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:53,560
you climb out.

803
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,170
Being in a deep potential--
being at low energy,

804
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,000
compared to the
potential-- means

805
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,640
that you're tightly
bound, right?

806
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,350
Takes a huge amount
of energy to get out.

807
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,810
And as a consequence, what
you saw in your problem

808
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,396
set is that the
bands are quite thin.

809
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,270
But as you get closer,
and closer to the top,

810
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,650
or as you go to higher energy,
the thickness of that band

811
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,710
grows as a measure of
the fact that you're

812
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,920
less tightly constrained
by the potential.

813
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,340
OK?

814
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:15,840
Good.

815
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,256
So, that's the
physical intuition.

816
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,490
Did that make sense?

817
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,460
Good.

818
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,010
OK, so, yeah?

819
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
g0 different from 0,

820
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,912
do you ever get to the point
where the solution is always

821
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:30,804
inside the [INAUDIBLE].

822
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:32,732
So, like the bumps [INAUDIBLE].

823
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:38,516

824
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,470
PROFESSOR: Ah!

825
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:39,970
Good.

826
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:40,470
Let's look.

827
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,760
Let's look.

828
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,190
So, let's answer
that by looking.

829
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,961
So, the question is, basically,
look, as you crank up g0,

830
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:47,460
do you ever lose
the bands entirely,

831
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,940
or do the bands just disappear?

832
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,114
Is that the question?

833
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,780
AUDIENCE: As you get
to higher energies.

834
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, as you
go to higher energies.

835
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,570
Good.

836
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,760
So, we can answer that.

837
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,142
Let me do that in two ways.

838
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:57,600
So, the first thing
I want to do is

839
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,760
I want to ask the first
of that question, which

840
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,594
is what happens as we
turn on the potential?

841
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,093
Here we have the free particle,
let's turn on the potential.

842
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:05,529
We know what
happens down here, I

843
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:08,070
want to ask what happens to the
picture of the allowed values

844
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,650
of q and the allowed
value-- sorry,

845
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,191
the allowed values of energy--
and their corresponding values

846
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:12,720
of q.

847
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,553
So, here, it's easy.

848
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:15,180
This particular point
on the blue line

849
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,602
corresponds to a value of
the energy, and a value of q.

850
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,060
What happens to
those allowed pairs

851
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,375
as we increase the potential?

852
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,750
And as we increase
the potential,

853
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,580
you can see on the left
that the right hand

854
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,340
side is exceeding 1 and minus 1.

855
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,810
And correspondingly,
on the right,

856
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,630
here the red dot is what was
the free particle-- parabola--

857
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,890
and the blue line is
the actual solutions.

858
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,360
What you find is when you
turn on the potential,

859
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,900
the actual solution moves
away from the free particle

860
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,500
line in a very particular way.

861
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,980
In particular, for this value
of energy-- around 100--

862
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,192
there are absolutely no
allowed energy eigenstates.

863
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:53,150
There are no solutions.

864
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,524
And so as correspondingly,
that area is not shaded green.

865
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:58,720
There are only solutions
where you have this blue line.

866
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,150
Everyone see that?

867
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,190
So, we get these gaps.

868
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,860
And we get bands of
continuously allowed energies.

869
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,630
And then gaps between
those allowed bands.

870
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,930
And I'm going to post this-- the
guy-- to play with on Stellar.

871
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,940
So, now, let's go up to
very, very large values

872
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,902
of the interaction.

873
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,360
OK, and let's see
what happens when

874
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,437
you go to large of interaction.

875
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:21,770
Well, one thing that happens
it that Mathematica sort of

876
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,000
panics down here, so it
lost an entire band, which

877
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,034
shouldn't happen.

878
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:26,200
Let's try this, there we go.

879
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,670
That's better There's
a wonderful book

880
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,580
on spectral methods in
solving differential equations

881
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,980
by a guy named Boyd.

882
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,450
And he's pithy, if
somewhat degenerate,

883
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,520
and he says at one point,
the definition of an idiot

884
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,570
is-- or he says,
idiot definition,

885
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,470
someone who doesn't reproduce
their numerics twice

886
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,910
with different parameter values.

887
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,560
And so, we could have just lost
this band and written a paper,

888
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,490
oh, band's disappear!

889
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,747
This is great!

890
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:59,830
Never believe Mathematica
until you've checked it.

891
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,407
So, anyway, here you see a band,
and another band, and another.

892
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,490
But what's happened is the
bands become very thin.

893
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,060
But that makes sense from
the earlier intuition.

894
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,768
We're making the
potential much stronger.

895
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:11,430
We're more tightly binding
particles into wells.

896
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,085
And as a consequence, the bands
are very tightly restricted.

897
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,460
And that fits very
much with what

898
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,589
we saw on your phet simulations.

899
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,380
OK, but-- hold on for
one sec-- coming back

900
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,916
to the question over
here-- yours-- coming back

901
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,540
to that question, if you look at
higher and higher energy, what

902
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,390
you're going to find is that
the bands get wider and wider,

903
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,367
and the gaps get
thinner and thinner,

904
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,700
as you go to high-- well,
it's a little more complicated

905
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,825
than that, it depends on
exactly what you're doing,

906
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:37,130
but-- the bands get
wider, the gaps get wider,

907
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,299
but both of them don't get
wider at the same rate.

908
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,840
So, this is actually
something you'll

909
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,070
look at on your problem set.

910
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,550
But the important
thing you will find

911
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,950
is that the bands
never disappear.

912
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,400
Like a band in 1D doesn't just
close and disappear altogether,

913
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,201
and the bands don't overlap.

914
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:55,700
And here's an easy
way to understand

915
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,640
why the bands don't overlap.

916
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,994
Let's look at what
these states are.

917
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,910
So in particular, I want
to look at the states

918
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,830
at the bottom of each
loud energy band.

919
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,890
So, let's go back down
to small value of g0.

920
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,930
So, we have these
big thick bands

921
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,447
with a weak little potential.

922
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:13,280
We have big, thick
bands, little, tiny gaps,

923
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,696
and I want to look at the
states at the bottom of the gap.

924
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,830
Let's make it maybe
a little bit bigger.

925
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,080
So, we'll look at the states
at the bottom of the gap.

926
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,204
And there's an optional
problem in your problem set

927
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:23,960
that works through
the mechanics of this.

928
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,340
But I want to look
through it in some detail.

929
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:34,345
So, what we're plotting
here-- Did that work?

930
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:41,021

931
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:41,520
Crap.

932
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,170

933
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,230
Unfortunately,
this is-- OK, good.

934
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,610
So, here what we have
is the ground state

935
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,240
of the lowest band
at zero interaction.

936
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,100
So, here, is g0.

937
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,750
And it's 0.001,
it's basically 0.

938
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,900
As I turn on the delta
function potentials,

939
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,233
what's going to happen to the
lowest energy state, which

940
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,400
is just the constant,
has momentum 0.

941
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,140
What's going to
happen to this guy?

942
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,830
Well, we saw from this guy,
that the lowest energy state

943
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,925
got a little bit of a gap there.

944
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,730
There is no state
at 0 energy anymore.

945
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,296
There's now a state only at
slightly positive energy.

946
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:23,920
A wave from what would have been
the zero energy, zero momentum

947
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,820
state.

948
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,147
Everyone see that?

949
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:28,230
There's this little gap
between 0, and the bottom.

950
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,816
And if we make the
interaction bigger,

951
00:41:29,816 --> 00:41:31,440
we'll see that a
little more obviously.

952
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,670
Here's the red is
the zero energy,

953
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,220
and it goes up to finite energy.

954
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,470
But has that lowest state
developed any nodes?

955
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,050

956
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,150
Does the lowest state in
a 1D potential have nodes?

957
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,659
No, right?

958
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:49,450
There's nodes here.

959
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,940
0 nodes, then one, then two.

960
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,350
And do they ever switch orders?

961
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,080
Does it ever go zero, two, one?

962
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,580
No.

963
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,180
There's the node theory.

964
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,400
So, what happens to
these wave functions

965
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,983
is all the wave
functions continuously

966
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,550
change as we turn
on the potential,

967
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,800
but they don't switch order.

968
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,900
Their ordering is completely
fixed by the number of nodes.

969
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,679
So, let's watch what happens
to the actual wave functions.

970
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,220
So, here's that
lowest state, and I'm

971
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,030
going to turn on the potential.

972
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,320
What's going to happen?

973
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,750
Well, we're going to see the
effect of the delta function.

974
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,910
And there, you see the effect of
the delta function turning on.

975
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,224
And as we crank
up the potential,

976
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:19,890
you see that the wave
function generates

977
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,340
a kink where there
is a delta function.

978
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,800
And that state has zero nodes.

979
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,930
That's the ground state.

980
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,530
Everyone cool with that?

981
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,200
OK.

982
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,770
Similarly, let's go to 0.

983
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,910
Whoops.

984
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,790
Oh, shoot.

985
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,020
Don't give me
infinite expressions.

986
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,520
You're not allowed
to divide by 0.

987
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,190
Oh, shoot!

988
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,800

989
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,274
OK, here's the second
excited state, this guy.

990
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,690
And let's look at what happens
as we turn up the potential

991
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,192
now.

992
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,150
Exactly the same thing.

993
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,025
We see a little kink.

994
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:53,850
We don't get new nodes.

995
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,860
But what we do get are
kinks at the potential.

996
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,401
This is for the special case of
the delta function potential,

997
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,720
but it's illustrative
of everything else.

998
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,075
So, going back to the
bands, what's going on here

999
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:04,950
is that these states
are getting compressed--

1000
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,450
they're getting
pushed up together--

1001
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,850
but they're not getting
swapped in their order.

1002
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,066
OK?

1003
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:12,440
And this was in the service
of a question that was asked.

1004
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,564
What was the last question?

1005
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:17,560

1006
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1007
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,160
PROFESSOR: OK, I
don't remember exactly

1008
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,201
which questions I was
answering, I'm sorry, but--

1009
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1010
00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:24,880
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

1011
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,621
AUDIENCE: I think it was
if you lose the bands.

1012
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:27,040
PROFESSOR: Ah, yeah.

1013
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,550
If you lose the bands.

1014
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,050
So, you know by the node theorem
that you never lose states.

1015
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,326
States with three
nodes can't disappear.

1016
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:33,700
That same with
three nodes always

1017
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,760
has to be between
the state with two--

1018
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,634
thank you-- between the
state with two nodes,

1019
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:37,970
and the state with four nodes.

1020
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,059
And they can't just disappear.

1021
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:41,350
So, those gaps never disappear.

1022
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,670
And they never overlap,
because they never

1023
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,600
cross each other, again,
by the node theorem.

1024
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,080
All you get is things
separating into bands

1025
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,910
and squishing together,
or spreading back apart

1026
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,215
and becoming the free particle.

1027
00:43:49,215 --> 00:43:51,394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1028
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:52,060
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

1029
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] strange
periodic potential and you'll

1030
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:57,410
get the [INAUDIBLE].

1031
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,160
PROFESSOR: Indeed.

1032
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,660
Indeed.

1033
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,910
So, that's exactly right.

1034
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,210
So, the observation is, look,
this was for the delta function

1035
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,010
potential, but we didn't have
to use delta function barriers.

1036
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,210
We could have use
little square barriers,

1037
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,790
I could have used little, you
know, goat-shaped barriers.

1038
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,914
I could have used whatever.

1039
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,502
And there's going
to be some answer.

1040
00:44:09,502 --> 00:44:10,710
And how's it going to change?

1041
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,760
Well, the way it's going to
change is where the bands are,

1042
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,511
how wide they are, and
how wide the gaps are.

1043
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,010
But the rest of the story goes
over in exactly the same way.

1044
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,718
The energy eigenfunctions
take the form E

1045
00:44:21,718 --> 00:44:24,240
to the iqx times the
periodic function.

1046
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,744
Cool?

1047
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:26,160
OK, and on your
problem set, where

1048
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,860
you're gonna show-- one of
the things you're gonna show--

1049
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,939
and I love this result,
because it encapsulates

1050
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:31,480
so much physics,
you're going to show

1051
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,650
that if you have a potential--
a single potential barrier--

1052
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,414
and you know the
reflection amplitude,

1053
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:38,580
and the transmission
amplitude-- or really, you just

1054
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,530
need to know one-- if
you know the reflection

1055
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,740
amplitude-- if it's
parity symmetric-- then

1056
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,290
you can write down the
band structure entirely

1057
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,340
in terms of-- you can
write down an equation

1058
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,890
for the allowed energies
as a function of q--

1059
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,350
entirely in terms
of the reflection

1060
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,690
amplitude and the phase shift.

1061
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,920
Which is an amazing fact.

1062
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,240
So, you know about reflection
off of one barrier,

1063
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,790
you make an infinite
lattice of those barriers,

1064
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,345
and you deduce the structure
of the allowed energy bands

1065
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:03,141
and gaps, which is cool.

1066
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,390
So, the scattering information--
as I kept promising--

1067
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,135
contains a huge amount of
the physics of your system.

1068
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:11,100
So, we saw that it
contains bound energies,

1069
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,370
but it also contains
these band gaps.

1070
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:15,170
OK, questions.

1071
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,919
Yeah?

1072
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:19,202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] If we
make the g0 go to infinity,

1073
00:45:19,202 --> 00:45:22,020
would that approach
a single [INAUDIBLE]?

1074
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

1075
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,660
Excellent.

1076
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:29,334

1077
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,750
So, the question was, what
happens as g0 goes to infinity,

1078
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,200
is it like getting single wells?

1079
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,820
So, let's look at that.

1080
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,750
It's a very good observation.

1081
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,060
So, here's a band
between-- I really

1082
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,420
should put a line
here-- but between here,

1083
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,850
and here, we have this band.

1084
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,580
And that corresponds to
between here, and here.

1085
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,022
As we make g0 stronger, the
derivation from simple cosine

1086
00:45:47,022 --> 00:45:47,980
gets larger and larger.

1087
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,521
The amplitude gets
larger and larger,

1088
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,800
and those bands get steeper,
and steeper, and steeper.

1089
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,940
And the allowed energy bands
get thinner, and thinner,

1090
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,400
and thinner.

1091
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
And, in fact, they get
so thin, that Mathematica

1092
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,390
loses track of some of them,
which is the annoyance.

1093
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,750
So, here we have
very, very thin bands.

1094
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,340
What happens is we take
g0 very, very large.

1095
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,310
So, let's make it 400.

1096
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,310
And, you can see, Mathematica
doesn't like that.

1097
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,434
It's totally lost the band.

1098
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,970
So, let's try something
a little less extreme.

1099
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,910
Oh, no, still too
big for Mathematica.

1100
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,715
Eight, you can do
it, little buddy.

1101
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:17,570
Ah, there we go!

1102
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:18,700
We can keep tack of one.

1103
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,960
So, what's happening
is these bands

1104
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,900
are getting extremely thin.

1105
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,540
And what's happening,
you're erecting

1106
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,040
infinitely high barriers between
each period in the lattice.

1107
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,105
And if you have
infinitely high barriers,

1108
00:46:28,105 --> 00:46:29,480
what are the
allowed eigenvalues?

1109
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,050

1110
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,390
It's the same as the energy
eigenvalues of the infinite

1111
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,680
well, because it has to be 0 at
those infinite barriers, right?

1112
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,200
So, all of those states-- all
of the states in the band--

1113
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,491
become degenerate, and have
the same energy, the energy

1114
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:44,990
of the periodic well,
or of the infinite well.

1115
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,360
Very good question.

1116
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,090
OK.

1117
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,630
So, let's let Mathematica
relax a little bit again.

1118
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,160
Well done.

1119
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,360
OK.

1120
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,240
And so, I want to
quickly ask why do we

1121
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,540
have bands in the first place?

1122
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,807
Why do we have gaps?

1123
00:46:59,807 --> 00:47:00,640
So, what's going on?

1124
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,264
Why do we have gaps
in the first place?

1125
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:07,088

1126
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,050
AUDIENCE: Because our
math told us we had to?

1127
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,660
PROFESSOR: OK.

1128
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,159
Good.

1129
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,060
This is an excellent answer.

1130
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,310
Not the one I was looking for.

1131
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,726
The answer is a good answer
because we did the calculation

1132
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:18,020
and that's what the
calculation tells us.

1133
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,900
And that is a completely valid
answer for a theorist, right?

1134
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,005
At this stage of writing
down what your theory is

1135
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:24,710
and making a prediction.

1136
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,300
But before you can write that
paper, publish it, and say,

1137
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,800
aha!

1138
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,890
I've discovered bands!

1139
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,485
You must have an explanation
to the following question, why?

1140
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,360
How do you know your
calculation was correct,

1141
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,430
before you've done
the experiment?

1142
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:35,850
So, one answer is, of course,
you do the experiment,

1143
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,510
and it fits like a champ.

1144
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,385
But that's not a very
illuminating experiment

1145
00:47:38,385 --> 00:47:41,104
as you know you're going to find
departures from your theory,

1146
00:47:41,104 --> 00:47:42,520
you want to improve
the situation.

1147
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,330
You want some intuition
about why this works.

1148
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,880
And you actually all know
the physics behind this.

1149
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,680
And we did it on the
first problem set.

1150
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,170
Remember the experiment that
we studied on a problem set,

1151
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,270
the Davis and Germer Experiment,
where you send plane waves

1152
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,430
onto a crystal, and due
to interference effects,

1153
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,120
the transmission amplitude
changes-- the transition

1154
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,250
probability changes-- as
a function of the angle.

1155
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,750
And the reason it changes as a
function of the angle was you

1156
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,990
had a crystal plane, right?

1157
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,860
So, atom, atom, atom, atom,
atom, atom, atom, atom,

1158
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,100
and a plane wave sent
in could scatter off

1159
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,730
of any of these
scatterers, right?

1160
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,240
Or it could transmit and
scatter off a further one down.

1161
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,530
And if you look
at the scattering

1162
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,550
off different scatterers, if the
effect of those scatterings--

1163
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,570
so one down, and then one
much deeper down-- if those

1164
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,530
interfere destructively,
then that's

1165
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,260
going to suppress
the reflection.

1166
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,130
And if they interfere
constructively,

1167
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,381
it's gonna enhance
the reflection.

1168
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:45,880
So, usually we think about that
Davis and Germer Experiment,

1169
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,296
we think about it as a function
of the angle of incidence,

1170
00:48:48,296 --> 00:48:50,545
either straight at, or
as a function of angle.

1171
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:53,250
And we ask, how does
the transmission

1172
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,040
depend on those angles?

1173
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,650
But there's another
way to phrase

1174
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,940
that question, you can
ask, look, on average,

1175
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,740
how deep does that wave go?

1176
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,600
Does the wave propagate
through the crystal?

1177
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,640
Or if it doesn't propagate
through the crystal,

1178
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,080
it's gonna exponentially
decay with some wavelength,

1179
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,830
with some decay-length.

1180
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:18,612
And what you find is that
whether the wave propagates in,

1181
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:20,070
or whether it decays
exponentially,

1182
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,990
depends on the energy
and the lattice

1183
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,870
spacing of that crystal.

1184
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:26,720
And this is exactly
the same thing,

1185
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,534
only we have a crystal
in both directions.

1186
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:30,950
We don't have empty air and
we're sending in a plane wave.

1187
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,224
Now we have a plane wave,
can it propagate through?

1188
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:34,890
Well, for some energies,
it'll propagate

1189
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,411
with continuous energy, or
it'll propagate continuously.

1190
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:39,660
And for some energies, it
will damp out exponentially.

1191
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,700
But if it damps
out exponentially,

1192
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,840
and it damps out exponentially
in the other direction too,

1193
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,464
then you don't get
any solution at all.

1194
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:45,940
It just completely dies.

1195
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,340
So, what's really
going on here is

1196
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,940
the fact that all of these
scatterers in this lattice

1197
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,554
are scattering centers.

1198
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,970
And if you send a little wave
packet in-- which you should

1199
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,380
think of as a superposition
of energy eigenstates--

1200
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,131
if you send a wave
packet in, the probably

1201
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:03,546
to get-- the
probability amplitude

1202
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:05,970
to get from here to here--
is the probability amplitude

1203
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,350
to go from here to here,
plus to scatter through--

1204
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,200
to transmit through and reflect
back-- plus to transmit,

1205
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,890
transmit, reflect, reflect--
or sorry, transmit, transmit,

1206
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,840
reflect, transmit-- plus all
the other crazy things you

1207
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,340
could do.

1208
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,334
And you have to sum up
over all those terms.

1209
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:25,000
You have to sum the
effect of how do you

1210
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,042
get from here to here?

1211
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,500
Every possible way
to get from here

1212
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,250
to there, a la the
two slit experiment.

1213
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,935
Sum of over all
possible paths where

1214
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:32,730
you bounce around scattering
off each of these scattering

1215
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,360
centers.

1216
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,220
And that's why the
band structure's

1217
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,179
encoded in the
reflection amplitudes

1218
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:39,720
from an individual
scattering center.

1219
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,210
Because now, it's just a
common [INAUDIBLE] problems

1220
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,418
of how many different paths,
and summing up the phase

1221
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:44,570
that you get.

1222
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,070
OK?

1223
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,370
So, it's just about coherent
and incoherent scattering.

1224
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:52,588
Yeah?

1225
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:54,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] crystal
and I have an electron.

1226
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:54,564
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1227
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:56,144
AUDIENCE: If I sent the electron
through the crystal in just

1228
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:57,894
the right way, with
just the right energy,

1229
00:50:57,894 --> 00:51:00,690
won't it just go through in
some states, without seeing it?

1230
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,160
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

1231
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,660
Excellent.

1232
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,952
So, the question is under
what conditions can you

1233
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:05,910
send an electron and
it'll just cruise right on

1234
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,180
through the potential?

1235
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,520
So, let's answer that question.

1236
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,260
That's exactly the
right question.

1237
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,140
So, let's pick up from here.

1238
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,300
And I want to ask,
what have we learned?

1239
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,490
So, what are the lessons
for g0 equal to 0?

1240
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,420

1241
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,410
So, the first lesson is
that the energy eigenvalues,

1242
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:41,440
E eigenvalues, are
restricted to lie

1243
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,500
within a band-- this
bands-- and the bands

1244
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,460
are separated by gaps.

1245
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,220

1246
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,550
Two, the energy
eigenstates-- so this

1247
00:51:53,550 --> 00:52:01,720
was eigenvalues-- the energy
eigenstates are all extended.

1248
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,290

1249
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:09,120
And we didn't even need
to find the full solution

1250
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,370
of this equation to know that.

1251
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,150
All we needed to know is
that it was a solution.

1252
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,460
That the energy eigenfunction
are eigenfunctions

1253
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,822
of the translation
operator as well.

1254
00:52:17,822 --> 00:52:19,780
And that tells us the
probability of that form.

1255
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,670
And that tells us what the
probability distribution is,

1256
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,750
which is the norm squared
of that guy, is independent,

1257
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,333
it's periodic.

1258
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,180
And if it's periodic,
it can't fall off

1259
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,794
exponentially one
direction or the other.

1260
00:52:28,794 --> 00:52:30,710
So, we've seen that the
eigenfunctions are all

1261
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,450
extended, and so
as a consequence,

1262
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,580
we have to build wave packets.

1263
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,785
So, therefore, we must
build wave packets.

1264
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:43,410

1265
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,960
And, again, the form of
the wave packets, psi

1266
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,120
is equal to the integral
dq f of q-- sorry,

1267
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,440
I'll say fq0-- sharply peaked
around the point q0 of q.

1268
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,420
And then the wave
function's E to the iqz

1269
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:08,680
minus omega t times
ru of x sub q.

1270
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,640
OK.

1271
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,170
So, we have to
build wave packets.

1272
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,450
So, three, this tells us
that those wave packets

1273
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,720
move with group velocity,
by the same logic

1274
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,510
as for the free
particle, V group is

1275
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:24,247
equal to d omega dk--
or dq-- evaluated at q0.

1276
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:26,580
OK, where q0 is where our
wave packet is sharply peaked.

1277
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,220

1278
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,850
So, that's already telling
you something really cool.

1279
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,880
Look at this lowest band.

1280
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,920
Let's make this a
little more reasonable.

1281
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,456
So, let's look at
this lowest band.

1282
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:46,596
And in particular, I'm
going to make this big.

1283
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:48,470
So, focus in on the
lowest energy band, here.

1284
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,710
So, there's the
lowest energy band.

1285
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,420
It goes from the top of the
band to the bottom of the band.

1286
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,180
It's just a little bit away
from the free particle,

1287
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,721
because we're looking
at a relatively

1288
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:57,070
weakly, perturbed system.

1289
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,442
I chose a small value of q0.

1290
00:53:58,442 --> 00:54:00,525
Actually, let's make it a
little more exaggerated.

1291
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:08,800

1292
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,040
OK, so there's the free
particle curve, the red one,

1293
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,540
and the blue one
is our actual band.

1294
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,991
So, that's the energy
as a function of q.

1295
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:18,587
And let's make it even bigger.

1296
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:19,420
This one goes to 11.

1297
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,576

1298
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:23,290
Let's see.

1299
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,820

1300
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,350
OK.

1301
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,980
And so what you can see is
the following, it looks,

1302
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,313
again, it's looks sort of
like a parabola at the bottom.

1303
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:32,360
And at the top, it curves
over, and, actually,

1304
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,170
goes to zero derivative.

1305
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,128
And it has to, because
it's got to be periodic.

1306
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:38,119
Because q is periodic with
period 2pi over L. So,

1307
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:39,910
what does that tell
you about the velocity?

1308
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,380
Well, let's look
at the velocity.

1309
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,610
V group velocity, of wave
packet with-- whoops,

1310
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:55,220
say, here's 0-- as a function
of q between minus 2pi over L,

1311
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,275
and 2pi over L.

1312
00:54:58,275 --> 00:54:59,400
What is the group velocity?

1313
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,358
And here's what I mean.

1314
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:02,730
What I mean is let's
build a wave packet which

1315
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,930
has a reasonably
well-localized momentum,

1316
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:05,930
say, at this value of q.

1317
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:09,260
So, I built a little wave
packet it has a peak here,

1318
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,500
and what does that
wave function do?

1319
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,850
Well, it has a group velocity.

1320
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,550
And the group velocity
is given by d omega dq.

1321
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,010
And now, we can't solve
that equation analytically,

1322
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,051
because it's [INAUDIBLE].

1323
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,400
But we can see, just by
eyeball, what this does.

1324
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,225
When q is equal to 0,
what's the group velocity?

1325
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:30,371

1326
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:30,870
Yeah.

1327
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,085
It's the slope, right?

1328
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:32,640
D omega dq.

1329
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,090
So, what's d omega
dq at the origin?

1330
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,890
0, right? 'Cause
it's just horizontal.

1331
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,490
So, it's 0.

1332
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,280
Good.

1333
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,630
What about a little
bit to the right of 0?

1334
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,040
What about if I give it
a small positive q-- wave

1335
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,170
packet localized with
a small positive q?

1336
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,550
It's got a little bit
of a slope now, right?

1337
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,420
Little bit of a positive slope.

1338
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,950
So, it increases.

1339
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,150
But then, it reaches a
maximum slope, halfway

1340
00:55:55,150 --> 00:56:00,770
through the domain.

1341
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,952
So, here, it hits
a maximum value,

1342
00:56:02,952 --> 00:56:04,410
and then the slope
comes back down.

1343
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,816

1344
00:56:06,816 --> 00:56:08,440
And if we'd went the
other way, if we'd

1345
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,250
made q a little bit negative,
the slope becomes negative.

1346
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:15,400
And that's the velocity.

1347
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,360
So, that's a slightly
strange thing.

1348
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,170
As we increase q, it
increases the velocity.

1349
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,170
Increasing q increases
the velocity for a while.

1350
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,750
That's just like k and momentum.

1351
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,947
Momentum is h bar k.

1352
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,530
So, that would be
increasing the group

1353
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,870
velocity for a free particle.

1354
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,400
But now, as we increase the q
to a reasonably large value,

1355
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:38,400
to 2pi upon L-- oh, sorry, this
is pi upon L, and pi upon L--

1356
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,200
so, if we do this to pi upon
2L, or roughly, to the middle,

1357
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,580
we get to a maximum value.

1358
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,130
And if we increase q
further, what happens?

1359
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,867
The velocity goes down, right?

1360
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:51,700
If we increase q further,
the velocity goes.

1361
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,410
This is strange.

1362
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,531
For a free particle, if
you had momentum h bar k,

1363
00:56:54,531 --> 00:56:56,780
and you increased k, what
happens to the expectation-?

1364
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,738
What happens to
the group velocity?

1365
00:56:59,738 --> 00:57:01,237
If you increase
the momentum, what

1366
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:03,320
happens to the group
velocity for a free particle?

1367
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,030
AUDIENCE: [MURMURS]

1368
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,613
PROFESSOR: It's gonna
increase, right?

1369
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:08,410
But not for a particle in
the periodic potential.

1370
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,740
The wave packet, as you
increase the crystal momentum,

1371
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,430
q, past this maximum, as you
increase the crystal momentum,

1372
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,560
you actually decrease
the velocity.

1373
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,190
And, in fact, if you
keep increasing q,

1374
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,090
eventually the
velocity goes to 0.

1375
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,630
And you increase
q a little more,

1376
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:25,190
and it actually goes negative.

1377
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,674
So, this is a funny
thing, it's not

1378
00:57:26,674 --> 00:57:28,840
behaving like normally you'd
think of as a momentum.

1379
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,340
And, indeed, is there momentum
conservation in this system?

1380
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:32,840
No.

1381
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,048
We have a periodic potential.

1382
00:57:34,048 --> 00:57:35,380
There are forces at work.

1383
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,950
Is momentum conserved?

1384
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:38,480
No.

1385
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,190
This is not a system that
conserves a momentum.

1386
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,106
Momentum can be exchanged
between the particle

1387
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:43,910
and the potential.

1388
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,010
Q is a good quantity.

1389
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,210
It's the eigenfunction of
TL, and that does commute

1390
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,300
with the energy operator.

1391
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,008
So, it's a perfectly
reasonable quantity.

1392
00:57:51,008 --> 00:57:54,770
But the momentum itself,
p, is not conserved.

1393
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,920
So, this crystal
momentum, q, is not

1394
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,090
the momentum, for
all these reasons.

1395
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,590
But it plays a lot
of the same role,

1396
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,291
especially near the
bottom of the band.

1397
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,599
Near the top of the band,
it's a little bit funnier,

1398
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,890
because if you increase q,
you get a negative velocity.

1399
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,280
If you decrease q, you
get a positive velocity.

1400
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,230
It's exactly the opposite of
what you'd normally expect.

1401
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,520
But let's hold on to that
thought for a second.

1402
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,120
So, there's another sense in
which the crystal momentum

1403
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,070
is like a momentum.

1404
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,804
And you're gonna show
this on your problem set.

1405
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:26,220
But it's very important in
giving you some understanding--

1406
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,160
some intuition-- about what
the crystal momentum is.

1407
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,470
On your problem set,
you'll show the following.

1408
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,114
Suppose I induce
a constant force.

1409
00:58:31,114 --> 00:58:32,530
For example, imagine
this particle

1410
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,113
in my periodic
potential had a charge,

1411
00:58:34,113 --> 00:58:36,490
and I turn on a constant,
uniform electric field.

1412
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,020
Then that particle experiences
a constant, uniform driving

1413
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,301
force, which I can write as a
linearly increasing potential,

1414
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:44,534
right?

1415
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:45,950
So, what you showed
on the problem

1416
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,600
set is that the force--
the expectation value

1417
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,310
of the force-- is equal to--
for a wave packet-- sharply

1418
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:56,410
localized around some
value, q0, the force,

1419
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,980
it gives the time
rate of change, d dt,

1420
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,624
of the expectation value of q.

1421
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:04,290
So, if you turn on a
force, what happens

1422
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,840
is q increases linearly.

1423
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,450
Thank you.

1424
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,420

1425
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,650
It's so hard.

1426
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,020
It's just so obviously 1.

1427
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,424

1428
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:18,840
So, if the force
is constant, then

1429
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,810
h bar q increases constantly.

1430
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,500
So, q just increases
linearly in time, yeah?

1431
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,765
But that's funny.

1432
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:28,390
Well, we'll come back
to that, just how

1433
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:32,133
funny that is in just a-- yeah?

1434
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,119
Question?

1435
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,221
No, OK.

1436
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,970
Well, let's think about
how funny that it.

1437
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,860
Let's tackle this, right now.

1438
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,620
So, imagine we start
with a wave packet, which

1439
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,760
is well localized around
zero crystal momentum,

1440
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,634
around q equals 0.

1441
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:47,550
Then what is that wave
function doing in time?

1442
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,841
How does that wave packet move?

1443
00:59:48,841 --> 00:59:53,090

1444
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,240
What's its group velocity?

1445
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,740
0.

1446
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,000
So, it's just sitting there.

1447
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,145
It's just little wave
packets slowly dispersing,

1448
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:00,270
quantum mechanically, yeah?

1449
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,710
But if we don't make it too
tightly constrained, and p

1450
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,535
and 2 too tightly constrained.

1451
01:00:03,535 --> 01:00:05,370
And the dispersion could
be made quite slow.

1452
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,828
So, it's just a
little wave packet,

1453
01:00:06,828 --> 01:00:08,930
localized around a
particular position.

1454
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:10,490
And localized around
zero momentum,

1455
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,850
and it's just sitting there.

1456
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:12,550
Cool?

1457
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,450
Now, let's apply a force.

1458
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,710
What happens?

1459
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,000
As we apply a force, a constant,
force with a positive sign.

1460
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,950
Q is gonna increase.

1461
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,980
So, the central value--
I should say, yeah-- so,

1462
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,480
the central value
of our wave packet

1463
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,160
is gonna go from 0 to
something slightly positive.

1464
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,160
Because q is increasing.

1465
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,785
What that means is
that the velocity is

1466
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:29,712
increasing at first.

1467
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:31,170
So, the velocity
is gonna increase,

1468
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,711
and in equal units
of time it's gonna

1469
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:34,280
march linearly along this way.

1470
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,710
So, the particle is going
faster, and faster, and faster,

1471
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,426
and faster.

1472
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:38,300
And that makes sense.

1473
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,675
You're driving the system by
putting on a constant force.

1474
01:00:40,675 --> 01:00:42,574
Of course it accelerates.

1475
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:43,990
The velocity
accelerates linearly,

1476
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,410
so the position
accelerates quadratically.

1477
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,380
So, let's plot the
position-- expectation

1478
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,840
value of the position--
as a function of time.

1479
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,300
At zero time-- it's
at the origin--

1480
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,780
it's at some trivial
position, x0.

1481
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,880
As we increase time, velocity's
increasing linearly for awhile,

1482
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,980
and the position is gonna
increase quadratically.

1483
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,650
Everyone cool with that?

1484
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,369
But eventually, at some point in
time, the velocity-- or the q--

1485
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,910
is gonna get to the
point where we're

1486
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,980
at the maximum allowed velocity.

1487
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,030
And at that point, what is the
curve for x gonna look like?

1488
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:15,140
It's gonna have an
inflection point.

1489
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,870
And as we increase--
as we wait longer-- q

1490
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,790
is gonna continue
linearly increasing, which

1491
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,740
means the velocity is
going to slow down.

1492
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,079
So, the thing slows down,
so its slope decreases,

1493
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,870
until finally it's got
zero velocity again.

1494
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,870
There we go-- zero
velocity-- dx dt.

1495
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,260
And then what happens?

1496
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,320
We keep forcing it.

1497
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,760
It's a constant driving force.

1498
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,800
But this is this,
by periodicity of q,

1499
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,580
and the thing is, we increase
q further linearly in time.

1500
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,180
As we increased q further,
the velocity becomes negative.

1501
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,220
So, instead of continuing
to accelerate--

1502
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,740
instead of continuing to move--
in a positive x direction,

1503
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,750
it starts going backwards!

1504
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,440
That's weird.

1505
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,148
You're putting a force
in this direction,

1506
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:58,120
and it's accelerating
in that direction.

1507
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,675
That's a strange effect.

1508
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,050
And as we continue,
eventually we

1509
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,390
get to maximum
negative velocity.

1510
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,530
Again, an inflection point.

1511
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:07,190

1512
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,565
And, at which
point, the velocity

1513
01:02:08,565 --> 01:02:11,106
starts getting less, and less
negative, or closer, and closer

1514
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:11,640
to 0.

1515
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,100
And we return.

1516
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,000
And so, in some
period, capital T,

1517
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,850
which is determined by how big
this constant driving force is,

1518
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:21,270
the particle returns to
its original position.

1519
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,841
Everyone see that?

1520
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:24,340
Yeah?

1521
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,320
AUDIENCE: Is it
starting at q equals 0?

1522
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,600
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

1523
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,270
At q0 equals 0.

1524
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:28,769
Exactly.

1525
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:34,680
So, at first point, so this is
q equals 0, this is-- sorry,

1526
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,730
q equals 0-- is
the initial point.

1527
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,790
And x is equal to x0.

1528
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,820
So, under this
process, the particle

1529
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,640
goes through an oscillation,
called a Bloch Oscillation.

1530
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,790
It's named after the guy
who invented the wave

1531
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,335
functions, the Bloch
Wave Functions.

1532
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:51,590
And this is a
deeply weird thing.

1533
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:55,070
Normally, you think, well, look,
if I take a charged particle,

1534
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,240
and I just put it in an
empty space, or in a box,

1535
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,350
or whatever, and I turn
on an electric field,

1536
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,600
what happens to it?

1537
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,630
It accelerates.

1538
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:03,650
But if you put that charged
particle in a periodic lattice,

1539
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:10,000
like copper-- idealized copper,
here, perfect uniform lattice--

1540
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,660
and you turn on an
electric field--

1541
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,300
or you put a capacitor
plate across the thing--

1542
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,499
that electron, at
first, wants to behave

1543
01:03:16,499 --> 01:03:17,790
like an electron in free space.

1544
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,060
It wants to accelerate.

1545
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,630
But then it finds out
it's in a lattice.

1546
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,770
And it goes backwards.

1547
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,120
And it just oscillates back
and forth, [INAUDIBLE]-like,

1548
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,721
you know?

1549
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,220
I really want to
get there, oh crap.

1550
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:28,925
I really want to get there.

1551
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:30,440
Oh no, I'm in a
periodic potential.

1552
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,880
And it just oscillates
back and forth.

1553
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,530
Is there any conductions
in this system

1554
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,880
due to the electromagnetic
field that we've induced?

1555
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,040
None.

1556
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,360
That is a strange little beasty.

1557
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,870
That is a strange,
strange property.

1558
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,240
And yet, copper conducts.

1559
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,740
Copper, which is
a uniform lattice

1560
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,570
of ions-- of
potentials-- to which

1561
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,820
electrons are stuck in bands.

1562
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,900
Copper conducts!

1563
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,040
The electrons don't do
this Bloch Oscillation.

1564
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:55,670
How come?

1565
01:03:55,670 --> 01:04:00,010

1566
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:00,510
Yeah.

1567
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,130
It's not perfect.

1568
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,213
And it's not perfect for
a whole bunch of reasons.

1569
01:04:03,213 --> 01:04:07,680
So, one reason it's not
perfect is that, so, first off,

1570
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,770
in a lattice of, say,
copper, or whatever,

1571
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,660
the ions have a finite mass.

1572
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,240
So, what that means is
they're not stuck in place,

1573
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,030
they also wiggle.

1574
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,060
When the electron moves,
one of the ions move.

1575
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,560
So, the whole thing
you should think

1576
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,320
of as a little wiggling
piece of jello.

1577
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,210
And as a consequence, they're
not perfectly periodic.

1578
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,690
This does a bunch of things.

1579
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,780
One is these are no longer the
exact energy eigenfunctions.

1580
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,935
You now have to deal
with the oscillations

1581
01:04:28,935 --> 01:04:30,480
and wiggling of the lattice.

1582
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,480
But more importantly,
here's something

1583
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,470
that can happen-- and
electron can move along,

1584
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,967
and it can kick one of these
ions-- it can bounce off

1585
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:39,050
one of the ions-- and
scatter some of its momentum

1586
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,410
into the ion.

1587
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,552
Not into the rigid
lattice, but it

1588
01:04:42,552 --> 01:04:44,260
could just make one
of those ions wiggle.

1589
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,870
So, it's changed the
structure of the lattice.

1590
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:47,760
OK?

1591
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,525
And what you can do then, is
you can have an electron that

1592
01:04:49,525 --> 01:04:51,780
is accelerating, and it hits
something, and it stops.

1593
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,820
And it accelerates.

1594
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:53,587
And it stops.

1595
01:04:53,587 --> 01:04:55,670
Accelerates, and it hits
something, then it stops.

1596
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:56,390
OK?

1597
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,920
So, when you have lots of
disorder in your system--

1598
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,000
or when you allow the
electron to bounce off

1599
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,780
things in the lattice-- you get
this effective conductivity.

1600
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,467
Things start their
Bloch Oscillation,

1601
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:07,550
then they collide, and
scatter off their momentum,

1602
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,140
and go back to zero
momentum, but they've

1603
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,348
moved over a little bit in
their oscillation already.

1604
01:05:11,348 --> 01:05:12,520
They move up, and they move.

1605
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,696
So, what that picture looks
like is, you accelerate,

1606
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:16,820
and then, boom, you scatter,
and you fall back down

1607
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:18,236
to zero momentum
by scattering off

1608
01:05:18,236 --> 01:05:19,990
your momentum into
something else.

1609
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,359
Same thing, you move
up, and then, now, you

1610
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:23,400
have zero momentum again.

1611
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,660
You move up, you have
zero momentum again.

1612
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,890
You move up, you
have zero momentum.

1613
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,890
You move up, you have
zero momentum, again.

1614
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,870
And so, you get this
effective drifting

1615
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:34,730
of the electrons, pointed
out by a guy named Drude.

1616
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,335
That gives you, effectively,
a conductivity and a solid.

1617
01:05:37,335 --> 01:05:38,960
Now, there are a
bunch of other effects

1618
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,060
that are important
for conductivity.

1619
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,600
Normally, we think of disorder
as something that, you know,

1620
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,200
if you make things
messy, they're

1621
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,950
probably gonna transmit
less well, right?

1622
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:49,215
But disorder is absolutely
essential for conductivity

1623
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:50,590
in real solids.

1624
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,600
Both for this reason,
because you scatter off

1625
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,260
of fluctuations, but also, when
you have a chunk of copper,

1626
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,485
it's not a chunk of copper.

1627
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,026
It's a chunk of
copper, but it's got,

1628
01:05:58,026 --> 01:06:00,067
you know, here and there,
there's a little carbon

1629
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:02,710
atom that got stuck, and
maybe there's a bit of nickel,

1630
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,530
and, you know,
palladium, or, you know,

1631
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:08,116
Berkelium-- pretty unlikely,
but could be there-- so,

1632
01:06:08,116 --> 01:06:10,490
you have all sorts of schmutz
sort of distributed around.

1633
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,500
And, again, those
are things that

1634
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,150
make the potential not periodic.

1635
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,920
And, so, will change the
conservation of this q.

1636
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,120
OK?

1637
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,032
Yeah?

1638
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:20,740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but if you actually

1639
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,660
managed to put a
alternating current--

1640
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:25,534
or an alternating voltage--
at the right frequency,

1641
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:27,700
you could actually drive
the electrons from one side

1642
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,280
to the other in this fashion?

1643
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:29,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so, I--

1644
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,768
AUDIENCE: --even though
the conventional way

1645
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:31,890
of thinking about
alternating currents

1646
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,520
is that the electrons
really don't move at all.

1647
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,270
PROFESSOR: That's a
very good observation.

1648
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,266
It's a little subtle, so
come to my office hours

1649
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:37,830
and ask me about that.

1650
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,163
But there's an interesting--
For a very specific reason,

1651
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,820
because it's easy
and unambiguous,

1652
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,670
I chose look the DC.

1653
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,580
But you're right,
looking at the AC,

1654
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,250
is really a very
entertaining example.

1655
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,862
So, yeah, I'm not
gonna get into it.

1656
01:06:46,862 --> 01:06:48,820
There's a cool story with
parametric resonance.

1657
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,200
And yeah, there's a
very nice story there.

1658
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,880
Come to my office
hours, because that

1659
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,230
is a particularly fun story.

1660
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,600
OK, but I want to do
one last thing on this

1661
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,650
before we move on.

1662
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,340
So, in this process, something
very strange happened.

1663
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,590
When we got to the top of
the potential, what we found

1664
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:06,270
was as we increase--
as we continue

1665
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:11,576
constant, positive force--
the velocity decreased.

1666
01:07:11,576 --> 01:07:12,540
Yeah?

1667
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,030
That is weird.

1668
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,030
Normally, when I take
a force, and I take

1669
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,280
some object with some
mass, and I take a force

1670
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,570
and I apply it to the mass,
and then the acceleration

1671
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:20,570
is the force
divided by the mass.

1672
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,528
In particular, mass is
always a positive thing,

1673
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:25,176
so if I take my force, and I
divide it by the positive mass,

1674
01:07:25,176 --> 01:07:27,550
I get an acceleration in the
same direction as the force.

1675
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,400
But here, we have
an applied force,

1676
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,520
and we get an acceleration
in the opposite direction.

1677
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,160
I thought our particle
had a positive mass.

1678
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,010
Didn't it have a positive mass?

1679
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,640
We started off with
a positive mass.

1680
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,181
We should still have
a positive mass.

1681
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,330
So, what's going on here?

1682
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,330
Well, we have a rule for
calculating what the mass is.

1683
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,340
We take the expectation
value of the momentum

1684
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,589
and divide by the
group velocity.

1685
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:52,630
So, let's find out what
the mass is for this guy.

1686
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,210

1687
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,670
And I'll do that here.

1688
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,570
So, this is a slightly
surreal moment

1689
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,855
with a nice little codon.

1690
01:08:02,855 --> 01:08:04,980
So, I'm going to write that
expression for the mass

1691
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,854
slightly differently.

1692
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:09,407
And you're gonna show in
your problem set-- PSet--

1693
01:08:09,407 --> 01:08:11,865
you're gonna show that that
definition of the mass-- M star

1694
01:08:11,865 --> 01:08:13,960
is p upon the group
velocity-- leads

1695
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,880
to the following expression, you
can write that as-- you can use

1696
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,470
that to derive-- that the mass
can be written as 1 upon h bar

1697
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:28,660
squared d squared E dq squared.

1698
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,680
So, the group velocity
is the first derivative

1699
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,837
of the energy with respect to q.

1700
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:36,420
The mass-- or really
q over the mass--

1701
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,840
is proportional to the second
derivative, the curvature.

1702
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,640
Everyone see that?

1703
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,431
So, this should not be
an obvious equation,

1704
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:45,779
unless you're breathtakingly
good at calculus in your head.

1705
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:47,260
It's just chain
rule, but it does

1706
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,340
take a little bit
of careful thinking,

1707
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,290
because it's a
physical argument,

1708
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,040
it's not a rigorous
mathematical argument.

1709
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,717
You're gonna do it
on your problem set.

1710
01:08:52,717 --> 01:08:54,550
So, let's take this
expression and let's see

1711
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,710
what the effective mass is.

1712
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,270
What is the mass
of our particle?

1713
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,600
Now, here, when I see what
is the mass of our particle?

1714
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,439
I mean a very precise thing.

1715
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,910
What is the mass of
the object moving

1716
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,750
in this periodic potential?

1717
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,580
That's what I mean.

1718
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,680
What is the mass of this thing?

1719
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,720
And we have a definition for it.

1720
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,410
Here it is.

1721
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:13,170
And let's plot this 1 over mass.

1722
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:14,778
So, let's plot this 1 over mass.

1723
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:16,402
Oh, that's not the
way I wanna draw it.

1724
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,229

1725
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:19,729
Yeah.

1726
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:22,429

1727
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,000
Yeah, OK, good.

1728
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,630
So, here-- oh, shoot--
so, let's do it this way.

1729
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,170
So, I want to plot 1 over
mass, in the vertical,

1730
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,960
as a function of q.

1731
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,290
And here is q is equal
to 0, and here is 1

1732
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,640
upon mass is equal to 0.

1733
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,390
So, at the bottom of the
band-- and this is pi upon L,

1734
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:49,000
and minus pi upon L. At the
bottom of at the band, at q

1735
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,660
equals 0, what is the mass?

1736
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,140
Well, here's the velocity,
and there's the band.

1737
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,560
So, what's the mass at
the bottom of the band?

1738
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,460

1739
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,230
Tell me properties about it.

1740
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:02,780
Is it 0?

1741
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:07,310

1742
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,810
Yeah.

1743
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,018
There's still some curvature.

1744
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:14,160
It's approximated by
some parabola, right?

1745
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,525
It's even.

1746
01:10:15,525 --> 01:10:18,920
And, in fact, you can take that
equation and derive properties

1747
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,420
about it.

1748
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,540
But it's some curvy thing.

1749
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,562
You can see that.

1750
01:10:21,562 --> 01:10:23,770
It's more obvious if we look
at a higher energy band.

1751
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,260
So, here's the minimum.

1752
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,100
Here's what it would
have been if we

1753
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,430
didn't have a potential, right?

1754
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,390
But here's the minimum, and it's
nice and curvy, and at the top,

1755
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:30,590
again, it's nice and curvy.

1756
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,923
But it's got a second derivative
there, that's non-zero.

1757
01:10:32,923 --> 01:10:34,450
Everyone agree with that?

1758
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:39,400
Now, here's the thing I want to
ask, is that second derivative

1759
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:44,945
the same as it would have been
if we had g arbitrarily small?

1760
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:46,024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1761
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:46,690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1762
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,394
Not so much.

1763
01:10:47,394 --> 01:10:49,310
No, if g was much lower,
the second derivative

1764
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,270
would be a bit different.

1765
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,940
OK.

1766
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,774
So, in particular, this
is some funny value.

1767
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:55,190
And I'm just gonna
give it a name.

1768
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,630
It's gonna have some value at 0.

1769
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,379
And, in particular,
it is positive.

1770
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,420
Everyone agree with that?

1771
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,600

1772
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,970
But there's a point here--
there's an inflection point--

1773
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,429
where this thing has
zero second derivative.

1774
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,220
And that inflection
point is the same point

1775
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,761
where the velocity
becomes a maximum,

1776
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:12,550
because the velocity's
a first derivative.

1777
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,160
So, when the velocity's
at a maximum,

1778
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,290
the second derivative has a 0.

1779
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:20,140
It's the derivative of the
first velocity, zero slope.

1780
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,880
And so, at that
inflection point,

1781
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,950
the velocity is 0--
or sorry, the velocity

1782
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,770
is a maximum-- and 1
upon the mass, goes to 0.

1783
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:35,240
And then, if we increase
q further, what happens?

1784
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,030
1 over m star goes negative.

1785
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:43,660
And it reaches a minimum
at pi over L, come back,

1786
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,790
and, again, repeats.

1787
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,260
So, it's periodic.

1788
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,870
I'm just artistically
challenged.

1789
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,971
So, how can this possibly be?

1790
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:50,470
Right?

1791
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:51,928
So, first off, what
this is telling

1792
01:11:51,928 --> 01:11:53,887
us is that we have a
point where the mass is 0.

1793
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:56,136
It's positive around the
origin, where things normally

1794
01:11:56,136 --> 01:11:57,080
behave intuitively.

1795
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,930
It goes to 0-- 1
over the mass-- goes

1796
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,595
to 0, which tells me
that the mass, m star,

1797
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:02,470
is going to infinity.

1798
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:05,636

1799
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:06,760
1 over the mass going to 0?

1800
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,920
Mass must be going to infinity.

1801
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,690
What does that mean?

1802
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,500
Well, what does it
mean for something

1803
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,541
to be infinitely massive?

1804
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:14,230
It mean f equals ma, if it's
infinitely massive-- then let's

1805
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,390
write that as acceleration
is force over m star-- then

1806
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,100
that tells you that
if you apply a force,

1807
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,450
you get no acceleration.

1808
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,850
But that's exactly what we saw.

1809
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,130
We get to this point, we
keep applying our force,

1810
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,920
and the velocity stays constant.

1811
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,020
There's no acceleration.

1812
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,520
Yeah?

1813
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in this equation,

1814
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:30,770
that's an external force, right?

1815
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,515
PROFESSOR: That's
an external force.

1816
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:31,790
AUDIENCE: So, only--

1817
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:32,180
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1818
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:32,420
Yeah.

1819
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,336
Purely external force.

1820
01:12:33,336 --> 01:12:35,563
I put a capacitor plate
across my piece of metal.

1821
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:37,351
AUDIENCE: So, my
next question would

1822
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:39,515
be is it all that insane then?

1823
01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:41,640
Because, like, you haven't
calculated the net force

1824
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,196
on the object, so to speak,
and so there is the potential.

1825
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:47,130
And so, yeah, the net
force is zero, sure,

1826
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,255
you're applying force, but
it's not going anywhere.

1827
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:52,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's not
a complete answer to what's

1828
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,560
going on here, but it's
a very good observation.

1829
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,010
So, let me rephrase
that slightly.

1830
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,230
So, look, I'm doing a
slightly strange thing.

1831
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,170
I'm applying an external
force, and I'm not

1832
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,100
treating it quantum
mechanically,

1833
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,670
I'm treating this particle
quantum mechanically.

1834
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:05,860
That's clearly stupid.

1835
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,330
We should treat everything
quantum mechanically,

1836
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:08,990
and derive the results
in that fashion.

1837
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:11,489
It turns out, in this case,
that the negative effective mass

1838
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:14,380
doesn't go away if we treat the
electromagnetic field quantum

1839
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,010
mechanically.

1840
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:16,801
So, you're absolutely
correct, but it's not

1841
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:19,170
enough to sort of make us
comfortable with the result.

1842
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,940
It doesn't change this result.

1843
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,440
But you're absolutely correct
that that's an important thing

1844
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,600
to do if we want to be honest.

1845
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,810
But this is a perfectly good
approximation for our purposes.

1846
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:33,364
So, the mass goes infinite,
and then it goes a negative!

1847
01:13:33,364 --> 01:13:35,530
1 over the mass goes negative,
so that's ridiculous,

1848
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,630
but that's exactly
what we wanted.

1849
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,630
The acceleration is the
force divided by the mass,

1850
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,740
but we found that when we apply
a force in this direction,

1851
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,577
we get an acceleration
in this direction.

1852
01:13:42,577 --> 01:13:44,910
That's a negative coefficient,
so, in particular, here's

1853
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,034
what I want to think about.

1854
01:13:46,034 --> 01:13:48,110
I want to ask the following
question, this value

1855
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,651
of the mass-- even
around the bottom,

1856
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:51,810
this should already be
disturbing observation--

1857
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,420
because this value
of the mass is not

1858
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,880
the same as the mass of
our original particle.

1859
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,463
And the way you can
see that is if you

1860
01:13:57,463 --> 01:14:00,130
go to various strong coupling,
then this band shrinks down.

1861
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:02,440
It becomes very thin,
and the second derivative

1862
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,400
becomes arbitrarily
small, which means

1863
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,652
the mass becomes
arbitrarily large.

1864
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,360
So, the mass is getting
larger and larger

1865
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,634
as we crank up the potential--
the effective mass--

1866
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:13,300
of whatever this thing
is that's moving.

1867
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,460
But this is strange.

1868
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,126
The thing that's
moving is our particle.

1869
01:14:16,126 --> 01:14:17,220
It has mass, m.

1870
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,660
Everyone agree with that?

1871
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,890
What is going on here?

1872
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,670
And here, I want to
do an experiment.

1873
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,109

1874
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:28,900
And my experiment--

1875
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,600
AUDIENCE: [MURMURING]

1876
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,110
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, the
seamless pong ball company,

1877
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:40,080
in recognition of my
contributions to physics

1878
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,640
and $3, has given me a series
of ping pong balls, with which,

1879
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,390
I'm going to do the
following experiment.

1880
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:49,110
OK.

1881
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:52,556
Here's the calculation
I want to do.

1882
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:54,430
The lesson I want you
to take away from this,

1883
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,430
is that you've got to
be very careful what

1884
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,805
you mean by, "the
mass" of an object.

1885
01:14:58,805 --> 01:15:02,204

1886
01:15:02,204 --> 01:15:03,620
Take one of these
ping pong balls,

1887
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,630
I'm not gonna do the
whole experiment for you,

1888
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,940
but I'll tell you the set up.

1889
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,360
Take a ping pong ball, and
the first thing I want to do

1890
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,300
is, I want to measure it's mass.

1891
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,320
Well, what do you mean
by measure its mass?

1892
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,130
Well, I'm gonna take it, and
I'm gonna put it in a vacuum,

1893
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,296
you know, we could take it
to France to were they do

1894
01:15:14,296 --> 01:15:16,010
the-- And take the
ping pong ball--

1895
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,510
ANNOUNCEMENT: One,
two, three, four.

1896
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:21,310
One, two, three, four.

1897
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:24,740
One, two.

1898
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:29,150
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

1899
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,774
PROFESSOR: We're just
gonna turn that down.

1900
01:15:32,774 --> 01:15:33,274
OK.

1901
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:35,238
ANNOUNCEMENT: One,
two, three, four.

1902
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:39,670
One, two, three, four.

1903
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,980
PROFESSOR: Can we kill that?

1904
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,155
OK, so.

1905
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:46,950

1906
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,730
So, we take our ping pong ball,
and we put some mass over here,

1907
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:51,620
with a known mass, and
we put it on a scale,

1908
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,030
and we wait until this
goes to the vertical,

1909
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,030
and we declare the mass.

1910
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:56,580
And what we find is that
the mass of our ping pong

1911
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:59,079
ball-- this is, you know, not
the greatest ping pong balls--

1912
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:01,904
but by legislation, this is
supposed to be about 2.7 grams,

1913
01:16:01,904 --> 01:16:03,070
or people get in fistfights.

1914
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,486
So, the mass of
the ping pong ball

1915
01:16:04,486 --> 01:16:05,790
needs to be about 2.7 grams.

1916
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,740
And, meanwhile, the
radius of this guy

1917
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,020
is about 20 millimeters,
so 2 centimeters.

1918
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,984

1919
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:16,130
Yeah, that's about right.

1920
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,932
And yeah.

1921
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:20,390
So, this is supposed
to-- morally--

1922
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,710
it's supposed to
be 2 centimeters.

1923
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,180
And so, if you go through this
and you compute the density

1924
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,260
from these guys-- so,
this gives you a volume--

1925
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,262
and if you compute the density,
the density is about 12.4

1926
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:29,845
by regulation.

1927
01:16:29,845 --> 01:16:32,100
Now, I've done this experiment,
and I've done this measurement.

1928
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,600
And I must've used
very cheap balls,

1929
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,720
because I got a very,
very low density.

1930
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,420
I got-- oh sorry, this is
the wrong way to do it--

1931
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:42,550
the density is equal to
1, in usual CGS units,

1932
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,380
is 1 upon 12.4.

1933
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,930
And I can write that as 1
upon 12.4 times the density

1934
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,090
of water.

1935
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,670
OK?

1936
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:52,330
Now, when I did this
experiment, I got 1 over 20.

1937
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,650
So, I was probably using
very cheap ping pong balls.

1938
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,649
But if you look at the
regulations on Wikipedia,

1939
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,570
this is what you're
supposed to get.

1940
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,010
Let's assume these are perfect.

1941
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,152
So, you do this.

1942
01:17:02,152 --> 01:17:02,860
There's the mass.

1943
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,569
That is the mass.

1944
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:04,860
That's what I mean by the mass.

1945
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,536
You take a scale,
you weigh the thing!

1946
01:17:06,536 --> 01:17:07,036
Right?

1947
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:09,620
Does anyone object to my
definition of the mass?

1948
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,809
It's an observational,
empirical process

1949
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:12,850
for determining the mass.

1950
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,380
If I take my mass, OK?

1951
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,439
And now I ask the following
question, if I take some water,

1952
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,730
and I pull my ping pong ball,
and I put it under water,

1953
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:21,760
and I put a spring
scale here, and they

1954
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,840
measure the force
on this ping pong

1955
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,150
ball, what will the force be?

1956
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:28,850
Well, the force will
be-- and let's just call

1957
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,580
this ten, because the
calculation's going

1958
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,400
to be horrible otherwise-- well,
whatever, let's call it 12.

1959
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,220
So, the force-- and
another way to write this

1960
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,975
is that rho water is
equal to 12 rho ping pong

1961
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:44,510
ball-- I did math there.

1962
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:48,020
So, the force-- we know this
from Archimedes-- the force

1963
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,140
is a combination of the
weight of the ping pong

1964
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:55,270
ball down, so, it's going to be
the density times the volume.

1965
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:01,800
So, the volume times rho ping
pong ball down, so, minus.

1966
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,920
Plus the volume
times rho water up,

1967
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,697
because that's the weight of
the water displaced, right?

1968
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:11,280
So, your weight down, minus the
weight of the water displaced.

1969
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,279
Everyone cool with that?

1970
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:12,929
Archimedes.

1971
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:14,470
It's pretty well
known at this point.

1972
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,990
So, this is equal to
the volume times rho

1973
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:21,540
water minus rho ping pong ball.

1974
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,250
And I can write this
as the volume times

1975
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,180
rho water is 12 rho
ping pong balls,

1976
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,510
so that's 12 minus 1
rho ping pong ball.

1977
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:31,550
That's 11 rho ping pong ball.

1978
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:35,350
But this is equal to 11
times the weight of the ping

1979
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:39,450
pong ball-- oh sorry-- 11 times
the mass of the ping pong ball.

1980
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,700
The volume times the density.

1981
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,630
So, mass ping pong ball.

1982
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:45,160
Now, there's an important thing
that I forgot to add here,

1983
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,270
what did I forget to add?

1984
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,000
G. Right?

1985
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,726
It's the force is
the mass times g.

1986
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:54,470
OK, g, g, and g.

1987
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,399
So, we get that the force is
equal to 11 m ping pong ball g.

1988
01:18:58,399 --> 01:18:59,440
Everyone agree with that?

1989
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,030
I haven't done anything sneaky.

1990
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,920
And so, as a consequence,
what this predicts

1991
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,190
is that if I take the
force and I divide it

1992
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,100
by the mass of the
ping pong ball,

1993
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,040
I get 11 times the
acceleration of gravity.

1994
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,590
And here's what that predicts,
that predicts that when I let

1995
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:16,710
go of this thing,
what should happen?

1996
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,410
It should accelerate
upward through the water

1997
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,360
at 11 times the acceleration
of gravity, which

1998
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,100
is roughly 10 meters
per second squared.

1999
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,920
So, 110 meters per
second squared.

2000
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,450
Does that sound right?

2001
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:31,600
Just intuitively,
does that sound right?

2002
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,640
If you pull something
like a ping pong

2003
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,556
ball, or a beach ball
or something underwater,

2004
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:38,250
what happens when
you let go of it?

2005
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,350
Well, at this point,
I'm going to remind you

2006
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,760
that physics is an
empirical science.

2007
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,014
So, let's see if we can do this.

2008
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,430
OK, now, what's
supposed to happen

2009
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:51,321
is this thing is supposed to
shoot out at nine times-- or 11

2010
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:52,820
times-- the
acceleration of gravity.

2011
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,660
So, it just shoots through
this thing much faster

2012
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,220
than equivalently.

2013
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,698
So which one's
going to hit first?

2014
01:19:59,698 --> 01:20:01,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

2015
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,020
PROFESSOR: Should it
come out, or should it

2016
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,895
hit the ground first?

2017
01:20:02,895 --> 01:20:03,920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

2018
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,420
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the ping pong ball.

2019
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,734
Great, that's helpful.

2020
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:07,640
Uh-huh.

2021
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,550
So, what's gonna happen first?

2022
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,670
Is the ping pong ball
gonna hit the surface,

2023
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,503
or is it gonna come
flying out of the water?

2024
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:15,070
This is accelerating with
the acceleration of gravity.

2025
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,569
And this it's accelerating up
with 11 times the acceleration

2026
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:18,820
of gravity.

2027
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,200
So, let's do the experiment.

2028
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,041
And this is what
they pay me for.

2029
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:22,540
Oh.

2030
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,956
This would be much
more satisfying

2031
01:20:23,956 --> 01:20:33,120
if we had a nice long-- how do I
want to phrase this-- cylinder.

2032
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,680
Oh, shoot!

2033
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,180
Stop.

2034
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,320

2035
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,470
So, it's best done with
a nice, long cylinder,

2036
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,380
but let's do this.

2037
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,210
So, which one wins?

2038
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,569
AUDIENCE: [MURMURS]

2039
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:44,860
PROFESSOR: Gravity wins, right?

2040
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,720
And why?

2041
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,630
Intuitively, why does this work?

2042
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:50,139
AUDIENCE: [MURMURING]

2043
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:51,930
PROFESSOR: I am neglecting
the drag effect,

2044
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,660
but I'm not really heating
up the water all that much.

2045
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:55,160
I mean, it's not
like the dissipation

2046
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,160
is all that significant.

2047
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:59,090
The dissipation of the momentum,
which is drag-- the friction--

2048
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,362
is not the most important
thing for our purposes here.

2049
01:21:01,362 --> 01:21:02,820
That water hasn't
heated up at all.

2050
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,054
So, what's going on?

2051
01:21:05,054 --> 01:21:07,747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

2052
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:09,330
PROFESSOR: OK, so
here's the question.

2053
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,788
Has a mass of the ping pong
ball, my empty little ping pong

2054
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:13,620
ball changed?

2055
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,324
So, something like
that has to be true.

2056
01:21:16,324 --> 01:21:17,490
But what's the right answer?

2057
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:21,330
The right answer is this,
the thing that's moving,

2058
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:23,970
is not the ping pong ball.

2059
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:26,100
The ping pong ball is
interacting with the fluid.

2060
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,020
And as a ping pong
ball accelerates,

2061
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,190
it drags the fluid
along with it.

2062
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:31,810
And as it goes
faster, and faster,

2063
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:34,239
it drags more and more of
the fluid along with it.

2064
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:36,280
And as it's dragging more
and more of that fluid,

2065
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,241
the effective mass
of the entire object

2066
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:39,990
that's moving-- which
is now the ping pong

2067
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:44,300
ball, and all of its associated
water-- is increasing.

2068
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,040
And now, if you take that force,
which was constant, and divide

2069
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,010
by this growing
effective mass, you

2070
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:51,777
find that the acceleration
rapidly falls off.

2071
01:21:51,777 --> 01:21:53,110
And you get a terminal velocity.

2072
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,050
And you know this
works, because if you

2073
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,150
blow a bubble under water,
it doesn't shoot upwards

2074
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:57,400
with an infinite acceleration.

2075
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,020
It goes glurg, glurg, glurg.

2076
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:02,930
And this idea, this idea
of the effective mass

2077
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,640
of a particle changing
with its state of motion,

2078
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,070
is an idea called
renormalization.

2079
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,690
And it plays an essential role,
not just in particle physics,

2080
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:13,140
but in all of modern
condensed matter physics.

2081
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,080
And we'll pick up at
this point next time.

2082
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,630
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

2083
