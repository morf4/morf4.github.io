00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,729
PROFESSOR: Before
we get started,

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,180
let me ask you guys if
you have any questions,

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,630
pragmatic or otherwise,
about the course so far.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,051

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:43,550
Seriously?

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,330

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,370
To those of you
reading newspapers,

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,560
I encourage you to find
a slightly different time

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,230
to do so.

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,842

20
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,050
I really encourage you find
a slightly different time

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,810
to do so, thanks.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,740

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,065
So far we've done basic
rules of quantum mechanics.

24
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:11,730
We've done solids.

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,355
We understand a lot
about electrons in atoms,

26
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:21,385
the periodic table, and
why diamond is transparent.

27
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:25,220

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,614
One thing we did along the
way is we talked about spin.

29
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:29,780
We found that when we looked
at the angular momentum

30
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,100
commutation
relations, these guys.

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,420
We found that the
commutators are the same.

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,630
For these commutators, we can
get total angular momentum, l l

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,900
plus 1 times h bar
squared for l squared.

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,730
And h bar m for a constant and
integer m for angular momentum

35
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,970
in a particular direction, which
we conventionally called z.

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,540
But we also found that there
were half integer values

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,250
of the total spin
and of the spin

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:01,710
in a particular direction
which, for example, with Spin

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,430
s as 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, et cetera.

40
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,330
And we discovered that riding a
wave function on a sphere that

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,980
interpreted these
states as states

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,560
with definite probability to
be at a particular position

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,270
on a sphere, a function of
theta and phi, was inconsistent.

44
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,900
In order for the wave function
to satisfy those properties

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,400
that have those eigenvalues
and, in particular, half integer

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,780
eigenvalues, we discovered
that the wave function

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,210
had to be doubly valued.

48
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,940
And thus it would equal to
minus itself, it equaled 0.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,480
So the rest of
today and tomorrow

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,100
is going to be an exploration
of spin, or tomorrow--

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,550
next lecture, is going to
be an exploration of spin

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,260
and the consequences of
these spin 1/2 states.

53
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,917
Exactly what they
are, we already

54
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,750
saw that they're important
for understanding

55
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,810
the structure of
the periodic table.

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,930
So we know they're there.

57
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,740
And they're present
from the experiment,

58
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,760
the Stern-Gerlach
experiment that we've

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,450
discussed many times.

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,030
But before I get
onto that, I want

61
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,692
to improve on the last
experiment we did.

62
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,400
So in particular, in
this last experiment

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,770
we talked about the effective
mass of an object interacting

64
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,740
with a fluid or an
object interacting

65
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,790
with its environment.

66
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,680
And why the mass of the
object that's moving

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,740
is not the same as
the mass of the object

68
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,440
when you put it on a balance.

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,710
And that's this basic
idea of renormalization.

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,890
And we demonstrated that.

71
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,450
I demonstrated that
with a beaker of water.

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,700
So I had a beaker of water
and pulled a ping pong ball

73
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,080
under water.

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,996
We calculated that it
should accelerate upward

75
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,400
when released at 20 times
the acceleration of gravity,

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,870
depending on the numbers
you use, very, very rapidly.

77
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,840
And in fact it went
glug, glug, glug,

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,390
but it wasn't a terribly
satisfying experiment

79
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,348
because it's very hard
to get the timing right.

80
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:41,070
And the basic issue there is
that the time scales involved

81
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,990
were very short.

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,120
How long did it
take for a ping pong

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,703
ball to drop from
here to the surface?

84
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:45,540
Not much time.

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,110
And to rise through the water,
not a whole lot of time.

86
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,350
So I did that experiment,
it was sort of comical.

87
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,600
But I wanted to improve on it.

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,900
So over the weekend, I
went down to my basement

89
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
and tweaked the
experiment a little bit.

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,850
And I called up a
couple of my friends,

91
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,615
and we did an improved
version of this experiment.

92
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:06,340

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,136
So this is a diver, I
think this one is Kathy.

94
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,885
Oh, shoot, we need to
turn off the lights.

95
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,940

96
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,860
I totally forgot.

98
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,100
good You'll never
see this if we don't.

99
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,270

100
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,620
You can do it.

101
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,770
There we go.

102
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,810
All right.

103
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,290
So here you see my friend, I
think this one's, actually,

104
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:31,910
is it Kathy?

105
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,440
I'm not sure.

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,270
It's hard to tell when
they have their marks on.

107
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,570
And we're in the tank at
the New England Aquarium,

108
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,169
and she's going to perform
this experiment for us.

109
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,960
And we're going to film
it, as you can see,

110
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,334
the bubbles moving
rather slowly,

111
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:51,520
with a high speed camera filming
at 1,200 frames per second

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,540
with which we'll be able to
analyze the data that results.

113
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,490
The camera cost as
much as a nice house.

114
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,960
And it's not mine, but
it's important to have

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,630
friends who trust you.

116
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,710
OK, so here we are.

117
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,404
You might notice something
in the background.

118
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:07,820
Before we get
started, I just want

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,042
to emphasize that one
should never take casually

120
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,500
the dangers of
doing an experiment.

121
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,474
When you plan an experiment
you must, ahead of time,

122
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:18,890
design the experiment, design
the experimental parameters.

123
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,810
We designed the lighting.

124
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,870
We designed everything.

125
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,310
We set it up, but
there are always

126
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,320
variables you haven't
accounted for.

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,694
And a truly great
experimentalist

128
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,930
is one who has taken account
of all the variables.

129
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,638
And I just want to
emphasize that I'm not

130
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:29,870
a great experimentalist.

131
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,780
So here, for
example, is a moment.

132
00:05:33,780 --> 00:07:21,901

133
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,650
I probably should have
thanked the sharks,

134
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,590
it just occurred to me.

135
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,540
Anyone who wants to take this
experimental data, which,

136
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,040
as you can probably guess,
filmed for different purposes,

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,720
I just manage to get the
ping pong ball into the tank.

138
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,330
Anyone who wants to get this
and actually take the data,

139
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,667
come to me, I'll give
you the raw footage.

140
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,125
And you can read
off the positions,

141
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,070
and hopefully for
next lecture we'll

142
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,130
have the actual plot
of the acceleration

143
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,990
as a function of time.

144
00:07:50,990 --> 00:08:00,762
So with that said and done,
the moral of the story

145
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,470
is you have to account
for all variables.

146
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,190
The other moral of the story is
that you saw this very vividly.

147
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,240
In the motion of the ping pong
ball up, when it was released,

148
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,120
there is that very rapid
moment of acceleration

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,560
when it bursts up
very, very rapidly.

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,045
But it quickly slows
in its acceleration.

151
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,274
Its acceleration slows down.

152
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,940
In fact, a slightly
funny thing happens.

153
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,671
If you look
carefully, and again,

154
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,170
anyone who wants
this can get access

155
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,890
to the video, what you'll
see is that the ping pong

156
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,092
ball accelerates and then
it sort of slows down.

157
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,550
It literally
decreases in velocity,

158
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,900
accelerates and slows down.

159
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,025
Can anyone think what's
going on in that situation?

160
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:36,802

161
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:38,260
AUDIENCE: Boundary
layer formation.

162
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,644
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

163
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,919
AUDIENCE: Boundary
layer formation.

164
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,585
PROFESSOR: Good.

165
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,506
Say that in slightly more words.

166
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,971
AUDIENCE: It's
starting to pick up

167
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:48,284
more and more water [INAUDIBLE].

168
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:48,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

169
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,283
Exactly. so what's going on
is as this guy starts slowly

170
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:53,816
moving along, it's pulling
along more and more water,

171
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,440
each bit of water
around it is starting

172
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,310
to drag along the
layers of water nearby,

173
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,930
and it builds up
a sheath of water.

174
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,250
Now that water starts
accelerating, and the ping pong

175
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,007
ball and the bubble of water
that it's dragging along

176
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,840
need to come to equilibrium
with each other.

177
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,140
They need to settle down
smoothly to a nice uniform

178
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,880
velocity.

179
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,710
But it takes a while for
that equilibrium to happen.

180
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,345
And what actually happens
is that the ping pong

181
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:16,090
ball drives up.

182
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,930
It pulls up the water.

183
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,930
Which then drags with
the ping pong ball.

184
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,860
So you can see that in
the acceleration, which

185
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,660
is oscillatory with a
slight little oscillation.

186
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,550
So it's a damped but
not overdamped harmonic

187
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,080
oscillator motion.

188
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,190
Any other questions
about the effective mass

189
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,120
of an electron and solid
before moving-- Yeah?

190
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,480
AUDIENCE: Why does
it speed up after?

191
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,840
That explains why it
slows down because it's

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,790
forming that sheath--

193
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,880
PROFESSOR: Right.

194
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,240
Why it speeds back up is it's
sort of like a slingshot.

195
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,377
As this guy gets going a little
ahead of the pack of water,

196
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,210
the pack of water has
an extra driving force

197
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,349
on top of the buoyancy.

198
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,390
It has the fact that it's
a little bit displaced.

199
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,690
So it catches up, but it's
going slightly greater velocity

200
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,690
than it would be if there
were uniform velocity.

201
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,710
So this guy catches up
with the ping pong ball.

202
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,090

203
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,310
OK so this is an of course
of course in fluid mechanics,

204
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:13,840
but I guess we don't
actually need this anymore.

205
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,490
Picking up on spin.

206
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,000
So the commutation relations
for spin are these.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,660
And as we saw last time,
we have spin states.

208
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,510
We have we can construct towers
of states because from the sx

209
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,530
and s1 we can build s plus-minus
is equal to sx plus-minus sy.

210
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:40,880

211
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,700
Sorry.

212
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,630
i, thank you.

213
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,380

214
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,960
So we can build towers of
states using the raising

215
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,990
and lowering operators
as plus-minus.

216
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,500
And those states need to
end, they need to terminate.

217
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,310
So we find that the spin can
have totalling momentum of s

218
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:04,730
squared h bar
squared l l plus 1.

219
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,310

220
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,630
And S in some
particular direction,

221
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,280
which we conventionally
called z, is h bar m.

222
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:23,040

223
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,250
I don't want to call this l.

224
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,440
I want to call this s.

225
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,430
For orbital angular
momentum this would be l

226
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,720
and this would be an integer.

227
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,330
But for spinning
angular momentum

228
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,996
these are all the
states we could build,

229
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:40,310
all the towers we could build,
which were 2n plus 1 over 2,

230
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,240
which were not expressible
in terms of wave functions,

231
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,370
functions of a
position on a sphere.

232
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,950
These are all the
1/2 integer states.

233
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,790
So s could be 1/2,
3/2, 5/2, and so on.

234
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,780
And then m sub s is going
to go from minus s to s

235
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:00,690
in integer steps, just like
m for the orbital angular

236
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,450
momentum, l.

237
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,950
So I want to talk
about these states

238
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,860
in some detail over the rest of
this lecture and the next one.

239
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,645
So the first thing to talk
about is how we describe spin.

240
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:14,770
In principle, this is easy.

241
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,020
What we want, is
we want to describe

242
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,650
the state of a particle that
carries this intrinsic angular

243
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,860
momentum spin.

244
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,700
So that's easy.

245
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,600
The particle sits at some
point, but the problem

246
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,670
is it could be sitting at some
point with angular momentum

247
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,640
with spin in the z direction,
say, plus h bar over 2.

248
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,319
And let's focus on the
case s is equal to 1/2.

249
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,860
So I'll be focusing,
for the lecture,

250
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,910
for simplicity on
the case, total spin

251
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,480
is 1/2, which is the
two-state ladder,

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,220
but all of this
generalizes naturally.

253
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,220
In fact, that's a very good
test of your understanding.

254
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,350
So for s as 1/2,
we have two states,

255
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,160
which I will conventionally
call the up in the z direction

256
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,711
and the down in the z direction.

257
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,210
And I will often
omit the subscript.

258
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,730
If I omit the subscript
it's usually z

259
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,830
unless from context you see
that it's something else.

260
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,732
So the wave function tells
us the state of the system.

261
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,690
But we need to know now
for a spinning particle

262
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,110
whether it's in the spin 1/2
up or spin 1/2 down state.

263
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,360
And so we could write that
as there's some amplitude

264
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,370
that it's in the plus 1/2
state of x and at position x.

265
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,920
And there's some amplitude
that it's at position x

266
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,270
and it's in the minus 1/2
state or the down state.

267
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,820

268
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:43,192
And we again need that the
total probability is one.

269
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,150
Another way to say this
is that the probability

270
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,234
that we find the particle to be
at x with plus or minus h bar

271
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:53,380
upon 2 being the spin
in the z direction.

272
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,660
So at x, spin in the z direction
is h bar upon 2 plus or minus

273
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,145
is equal to norm squared of
psi plus or minus of x squared.

274
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,020
So this is one way you
could talk about spin,

275
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,630
and you could develop the
theory of spin nicely here.

276
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,632
But it's a somewhat
cumbersome formalism.

277
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,090
The formulation I
want to introduce

278
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,900
is one which involves
matrices and which

279
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,680
presages the study
of matrix mechanics

280
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,505
which you'll be using in 805.

281
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,505
So instead, I want to
take these two components,

282
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,420
and what we see already is
that we can't use a single wave

283
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,870
function to describe a
particle at spin 1/2.

284
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,320
We need to use two functions.

285
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,070
And I want to organize
them in a nice way.

286
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,300
I'm going to write
them as psi is

287
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,940
equal to-- and I'll call
this capital psi of x--

288
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,630
is a two component vector,
or so-called spinner,

289
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,115
psi up of x and psi down of x.

290
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:50,560
So it's a two component object.

291
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,190
It's got a top and
a bottom component.

292
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,720
And notice that its conjugate,
or its adjoint, psi dagger,

293
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,570
is going to be equal
to psi up, complex

294
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,790
conjugate psi down, a row
vector, or a row spinner.

295
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,740

296
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,860
And for normalization we'll
need that the total probability

297
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,400
is 1 which says that
psi capital dagger

298
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:34,000
psi, psi capital with
psi is equal to 1.

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,266
But this is going to be
equal to the integral dx.

300
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,432
And now we have to take the
inner product of the two

301
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,120
vectors.

302
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,740
So integral dx of psi up
squared plus psi down squared.

303
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Cool?

304
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,724
Yep?

305
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:55,157
AUDIENCE: What's the
coordinate x representing here?

306
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,740
PROFESSOR: The coordinate x is
just representing the position.

307
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,030
So what I'm saying
here is I have,

308
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,113
again, we're in one dimension
just for simplicity,

309
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:05,920
it's saying, look if I have a
particle that carries spin 1/2,

310
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,912
it could be anywhere.

311
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:08,120
Let's say it's at position x.

312
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,369
So what's the amplitude at
position x and spinning up,

313
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,500
and I'm not going to
indicate spinning down.

314
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,000
OK?

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,750

316
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,500
I like my coffee.

317
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,050

318
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,090
So that's what the of x
indicates, and I've just

319
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,145
been dropping the of x.

320
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:25,957

321
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:28,290
So there's some probability
that it's at any given point

322
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,940
and either spin up or spin down.

323
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,670
Now, again, it's important,
although I'm going to do this,

324
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,930
and we conventionally do
this spin up and down,

325
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,592
this spin is
pointing in a vector

326
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,800
space that's two dimensional.

327
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,334
It's either plus 1/2 or
minus 1/2 h bar upon 2 h bar.

328
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,875
So it's not like
the spin is an arrow

329
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,920
in three dimensional
space that points.

330
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,930
Rather, what it is, it's
saying, if I measure

331
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,090
the spin along some axis, it
can take one of two values.

332
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,520
And that was shown in the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, where

333
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,970
if we have a gradient of
the magnetic field, dbz,

334
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,220
in the z direction, and this
is our Stern-Gerlach box,

335
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,680
and we send an electron
in, the electron always

336
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,140
comes out in one
of two positions.

337
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,920
OK.

338
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,020
Now, this is not saying there is
a vector associated with this,

339
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,160
that the electron has a
angular momentum vector that

340
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,910
points in some
particular direction.

341
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,900
Rather, it's saying that
there are two possible values,

342
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,650
and we're measuring
along the z direction.

343
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,680
Cool?

344
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,430
So it's important not
to make that mistake

345
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,460
to think of this as some
three dimensional vector.

346
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,760
It's very explicitly a vector in
a two dimensional vector space.

347
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,460
It's not related to
regular rotations.

348
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,433
Yeah?

349
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,377
AUDIENCE: Where you write
psi of x equals psi plus 1

350
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:44,856
plus psi [INAUDIBLE].

351
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,842
PROFESSOR: Yes.

352
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,978
AUDIENCE: Do we need a
1 over square root of 2

353
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,310
in front of that thing?

354
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I haven't
assumed their normalization,

355
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,050
but each one could be
independently normalized

356
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,000
appropriately.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,132
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

358
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:57,840
PROFESSOR: Right.

359
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,900
The whole thing has to
be properly normalized,

360
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,951
and writing it this way,
this is just the [INAUDIBLE].

361
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:03,450
Good.

362
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,510

363
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,080
So there's another
nice bit of notation

364
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,890
for this which is
often used, which

365
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,230
is probably the most
common notation.

366
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,060
Which is to write psi
of x is equal to psi up

367
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,650
at x times the vector 1, 0 plus
psi down of x times the vector

368
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,150
0, 1.

369
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,540

370
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,550
So this is what I'm going
to refer to as the up

371
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,052
vector in the z direction.

372
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,510
And this is what
I'm going to refer

373
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,840
to as the down in the
z direction vector.

374
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,120

375
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,330
And that's going to allow me to
write all the operations we're

376
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,020
going to need to study
spin in terms of simple two

377
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,900
by two matrices.

378
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,400
Yeah?

379
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,392
AUDIENCE: Will those two
psi's not be the same?

380
00:18:57,392 --> 00:18:59,100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
general, they're not.

381
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,065
So for example, here's a
situation, a configuration,

382
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,570
a quantum system could be in.

383
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,611
The quantum system could
be in the configuration,

384
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,361
the particle is here
and it's spinning up.

385
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,860
And it could be in
the configuration

386
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,070
the particles over here,
and it's spinning down.

387
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,800
And given that it could be
in those two configurations

388
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,410
it could also be in
the superposition

389
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,090
over here and up and
over here and down.

390
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,669
Right?

391
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,710
So that would be different
spatial wave functions

392
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,330
multiplying the
different spin wave

393
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,330
functions, spin part
of the wave function.

394
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,091
Make sense?

395
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:24,590
OK.

396
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,267
So these are not
the same function.

397
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,600
They could be the same function.

398
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,020
It could be that you could be
either spin up or spin down

399
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,152
at any given point with
some funny distribution,

400
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,610
but they don't need
to be the same.

401
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,130
That's the crucial thing.

402
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,380
Other questions?

403
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,734
Yeah.

404
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,542
AUDIENCE: I know
that [INAUDIBLE]

405
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,285
is a way to call them.

406
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,930
So like [INAUDIBLE]
something, are they

407
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,524
anti-parallel, perpendicular,
or are they something?

408
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

409
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,100
So here's what we can say.

410
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,880
We know that an electron
which carries sz

411
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,530
is plus h bar upon 2,
and a state corresponding

412
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,960
to minus h bar upon 2 are
orthogonal because those

413
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,080
are two different eigenvectors
of the same operator, sz.

414
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,070
So these guys are orthogonal.

415
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,710
Up in the z direction
and down to the z

416
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,070
directions are orthogonal.

417
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,680
And thank you for
this question, it's

418
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,264
a good way to think
about how wrong it

419
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,930
is to think of up and down being
up and down in the z direction.

420
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,100
Are these guys orthogonal?

421
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,409
These vectors in space?

422
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:20,950
AUDIENCE: No.

423
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,900
PROFESSOR: No, they happen
to be parallel with a minus 1

424
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,180
in the overlap, right?

425
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,830
So sz as up sc as down
are orthogonal vectors,

426
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,850
but this is clearly
not sz as down, right?

427
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,640
So the direction that they're
pointing, the up and down,

428
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,510
should not be thought
of as a direction

429
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,143
in three-dimensional space.

430
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:38,910
AUDIENCE: It's just [INAUDIBLE].

431
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,535
PROFESSOR: It's just
a different thing.

432
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:44,080
What it does tell you, is if
you rotate the system by a given

433
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,450
amount, how does the phase
of the wave function change.

434
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:53,760

435
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,950
But what it does tell you is how
the spin operations act on it.

436
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,211
In particular, sz acts with
a plus 1/2 or minus 1/2.

437
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:00,460
They're just different states.

438
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,724
Yeah?

439
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,215
AUDIENCE: Is this
similar to what

440
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:05,700
happens when
polarizations [INAUDIBLE]?

441
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,380
PROFESSOR: It's similar to
the story of polarizations

442
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,960
except polarizations are
vectors not spinners.

443
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,324
It's similar in the sense
that they look and smell

444
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:15,990
like vectors in
three-dimensional space,

445
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,470
but they mean slightly--
technically-- slightly

446
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,430
different things.

447
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,737
In the case of
polarizations of light,

448
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,570
those really are honest
vectors, and there's

449
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,000
a sharp relationship
between rotations in space.

450
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,270
But that's a sort of quirk.

451
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,640
They're both spin and vectors.

452
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,990
These are not.

453
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,750
OK so here's a notation
I'm going to use.

454
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,550
Just to alert you,
a common notation

455
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,440
that people use
in Dirac notation

456
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,130
is to say that the wave function
is equal to psi up at x times

457
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,890
the state up plus psi down
at x times the state down.

458
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,370
So for those of you who speak
Dirac notation at this point,

459
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,259
then this means the
same thing as this.

460
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,300
For those of you who don't,
then this means this.

461
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,030

462
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,690
What I want to do is I want to
develop a theory of the spin

463
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,340
operators, and I
want to understand

464
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,595
what it means to be
a spin 1/2 state.

465
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:20,220
Now, in particular, what I mean
by develop a theory of the spin

466
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,980
operators, if I was talking
about four orbital angular

467
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,730
momentum, say the
orbital angular momentum

468
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,080
in the z direction, I know
what operator this is.

469
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,860
If you hand me a wave function,
I can act on it with lz

470
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,239
and tell you what the result is.

471
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,530
And that means that I can
construct the eigenfunctions.

472
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,790
And that means I can construct
the allowed eigenvalues,

473
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,610
and I can talk
about probabilities.

474
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,194
Right?

475
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:40,610
But in order to
do all that I need

476
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,060
to know how the operator acts.

477
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,800
And we know how
this operator acts.

478
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,790
It acts as h bar upon i dd
phi where phi is the angular

479
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,580
coordinate around the equator.

480
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,160
And so given any wave function,
a function of x, y, and z

481
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,640
or r, theta, and phi, I
can act with this operator,

482
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,870
know how the operator acts.

483
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:08,152
And it's true, that again, lx
with lx is equal to i h bar lz.

484
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,110
It satisfies the same
time computation relation

485
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,642
as the spin.

486
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:13,100
But we know the spin operators
cannot be expressed in terms

487
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,569
of derivatives along a sphere.

488
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,860
I've harped on that many times.

489
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,651
So what I want to know
is what's the analog

490
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:20,390
of this equation for spin?

491
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,330
What is a representation
of the spin operators

492
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,450
acting on the spinners,
acting on states

493
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,660
that carry half integer spin?

494
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,368
We know it's not going
to be derivatives.

495
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,730
What is it going to be?

496
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,010
Everyone cool with the goal?

497
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,480

498
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,670
In order to do that,
we need to first decide

499
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,620
just some basic definition
of spin in the z direction.

500
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,240
So what do the angular
momentum operators do?

501
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,080
Well whatever else is true of
the spin in the z direction

502
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:57,100
operator, sz acting on a state
up is equal to h bar upon 2 up.

503
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,620
And sz actually
on a state down is

504
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,830
equal to h bar
minus upon 2 down.

505
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,600

506
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,780
And similarly s
squared on up or down--

507
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,510
Oh, by the way, I'm going
to relatively casually

508
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:25,820
oscillate between the notations
up and plus, up or down,

509
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,095
and plus or minus.

510
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:31,820

511
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,180
So sometimes I will write plus
for up and minus for down.

512
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,570
So I apologize for
the sin of this.

513
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,750
s squared on plus, this
is the plus 1/2 state,

514
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:45,440
is equal to h bar squared
ss plus 1, but s is 1/2,

515
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,330
so 1/2 times 1/2 plus 1 is 3/4
h bar squared times 3 over 4.

516
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,860
And we get the same
thing up, ditto down.

517
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,420

518
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,710
Because s squared acts the same
way on all states in a tower.

519
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,110
Going up and down through
a tower of angular momentum

520
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,693
states, raising and
lowering, does not

521
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,410
change the total
angular momentum

522
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,360
because s plus and s
minus commute with s

523
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,600
squared because they have
exactly the same commutation

524
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,330
relations as the
angular momentum.

525
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,197
That's an awesome sound.

526
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:23,780
So I want to know
what these look like

527
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,849
in terms of this vector
space notation, up and down.

528
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:28,890
And for the moment I'm
going to dispense entirely

529
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,960
with the spatial dependence.

530
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,190
I'm going to treat
the spatial dependence

531
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,585
as an overall constant.

532
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:35,070
So we're equally likely
to be in all positions.

533
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:41,460
So we can focus just on
the spin part of the state.

534
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,680
So again I want to replace
up by 1, 0 and down by 0, 1.

535
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,510
And I want to think
about how this looks.

536
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,995
So what this looks like is
sz acting on [INAUDIBLE] 1,

537
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:56,400
0 is equal to h
bar upon 2, 1, 0.

538
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,250
And sz on 0, 1 is
h bar upon 2, 0, 1.

539
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,470

540
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:13,150
And s squared on 1, 0 is equal
to 3 h bar squared on 4, 1, 0.

541
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:18,950
And ditto for 0, 1.

542
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,590
Yeah?

543
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,840
AUDIENCE: That [INAUDIBLE]
should have a line over it.

544
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,300
PROFESSOR: Oh, thank you.

545
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,240
Yes, it really should.

546
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,955
AUDIENCE: So how do
you get 3/4 there?

547
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:27,830
PROFESSOR: 3/4, good.

548
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,670
Where that came from
is that remember

549
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,250
that when we constructed the
eigenfunctions of l squared,

550
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,340
l squared acting
on a state lm was

551
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,250
equal to h bar
squared l l plus 1.

552
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,654
l plus 1 on [? file m. ?] Now
if we do exactly the same logic,

553
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,070
which we actually
did at the time.

554
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,460
We did in full generality
whether the total angular

555
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,040
momentum was an integer
or a half integer.

556
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,486
We found that if
we took, I'm just

557
00:26:54,486 --> 00:26:56,920
going to use for the half
integer states the symbol s,

558
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,870
but it's exactly the
same calculation.

559
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,030
s squared on phi and again
sm sub s is equal to h bar

560
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:09,730
squared s s plus
1 phi s m sub s.

561
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,660
OK and so for s
equals 1/2 then s,

562
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:20,160
s plus 1, is equal to 1/2
times 3/2, which is 3/4.

563
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,660
Yeah?

564
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
s equals [INAUDIBLE].

565
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Isn't that [INAUDIBLE]?

566
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,780
PROFESSOR: Ah, but remember,
does l go negative?

567
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,280
Great.

568
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,330
Does s go negative?

569
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,920
No. s is just
labeling the tower.

570
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,980
So s is 0, it's 1, it's 2.

571
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,960
And so for example, here, these
are states where the s is 1/2

572
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,850
and the s in the z direction
can be plus 1/2 or minus 1/2.

573
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,330
s is 3/2 and then s in
the z direction can be m

574
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,820
is 3/2, 1/2, minus
1/2, minus 3/2.

575
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,110
OK.

576
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,010
Other questions?

577
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,798
OK, yeah.

578
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,280
AUDIENCE: What about the
lowering and raising of those?

579
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,652
PROFESSOR: Good, we're going
to have to construct them,

580
00:27:58,652 --> 00:27:59,610
because, what are they?

581
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,110
Well, they lower
and raise, so we're

582
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,591
going to have to build the
states that lower and raise.

583
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:06,007
AUDIENCE: And would lowering
on the up will give you down,

584
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,579
but raising on up--?

585
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:09,370
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

586
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,709
So what did it mean
that we had towers?

587
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:12,750
Let me do that back here.

588
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,329
So the question is,
look, we're going

589
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:16,370
to have to use the raising
and lowering operators

590
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,995
at the end of the
day, but what happens

591
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,790
if I raise the bottom
state-- what if I raise down?

592
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,010
I'll get up.

593
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,940
And what happens if I raise up?

594
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,670
You get 0.

595
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,270
That's the statement
that the tower ends.

596
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,810
On the other hand, if s is 3/2,
what happens if I raise 1/2?

597
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,800
I get 3/2.

598
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,070
And if I raise 3/2, I get
nothing, I get 0, identically.

599
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,950
And that's the statement
that the tower ends.

600
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,360
So for every tower
labeled by s, we

601
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,390
have a set of states labeled by
m which goes from minus s to s

602
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,750
in integer steps.

603
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,430
The raising operator
raises us by 1,

604
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,100
the lowering
operator lowers by 1.

605
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,300
The lowering operator
annihilates the bottom state,

606
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,140
the raising operator
kills the top state.

607
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,510
Cool?

608
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,254
Yeah.

609
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:01,110
AUDIENCE: Do states
like 3/2 and 5/2

610
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,430
have anything akin
to up and down?

611
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,110
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so-- do they have

612
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,460
anything akin to up and down.

613
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,097
Up and down is just a name.

614
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,930
It doesn't really
communicate anything other

615
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:14,750
than it's shorthand for
spin in the z direction 1/2.

616
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,300
So the question could
be translated as,

617
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,350
are there convenient
and illuminating names

618
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,190
for the spin 3/2 states?

619
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,010
And I don't really know.

620
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,059
I don't know.

621
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:27,100
I mean, the states exist.

622
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,400
So we can build
nuclear particles that

623
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,691
have angular momentum 3/2,
or 5/2, all sorts of things.

624
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,940
But I don't know
of a useful name.

625
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,728
For the most part,
we simplify our life

626
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:35,936
by focusing on the 1/2 state.

627
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:39,740
And as you'll discover in
8.05, the spin 1/2 states,

628
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,320
if you know them
very, very well,

629
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,611
you can use everything you
know about them to construct

630
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:47,700
all of the spin 5/2 8/2--
well, 8/2 is stupid, but-- 9/2,

631
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,410
all those from the spin 1/2.

632
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,290
So it turns out spin
1/2 is sort of Ur--

633
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,940
in a way that can be
made very precise,

634
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,010
and that's the theory
of Lie algebras.

635
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,509
Yeah.

636
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,089

637
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,755
AUDIENCE: Can you
just elaborate on what

638
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:02,171
you meant by, you can't really
think of spin as an angular

639
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,200
momentum vector?

640
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

641
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,030
So OK, good.

642
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,654
So the question is, elaborate a
little bit on what you mean by,

643
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:10,160
spin can't be thought of as
an angular momentum vector.

644
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,590
Spin certainly can be thought
of as an angular momentum,

645
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,620
because the whole point here
was that if you have a charged

646
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,980
particle and it carries spin,
then it has a magnetic moment.

647
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,840
And a magnetic
moment is the charge

648
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,950
times the angular momentum.

649
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,250
So if it carries spin,
and it carries charge,

650
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,334
and thus it carries
magnetic moment--

651
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,500
that's pretty much what we
mean by angular momentum.

652
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,470
That's as good a
diagnostic as any.

653
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,230
Meanwhile, on top of satisfying
that experimental property,

654
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,300
this, just as a set of
commutation relations,

655
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,674
these commutation relations
are the commutation relations

656
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:47,581
of angular momentum.

657
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,080
It just turns out that we can
have states with total angular

658
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,360
momentum little s, which is 1/2
integral-- 1/2, 3/2, et cetera.

659
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,940
Now, the things that I want
to emphasize are twofold.

660
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,390
First off, something I've
harped on over and over again,

661
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,690
so I'll attempt to limit
my uses of this phrase.

662
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,530
But you cannot think of these
states with s is 1/2 as wave

663
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,564
functions determining
position on a sphere.

664
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,980
So that's the first
sense in which

665
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,350
you can't think of it as
equivalent to orbital angular

666
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,850
momentum.

667
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,800
But there's a
second sense, which

668
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,169
is that up and down should
not be thought of as spin

669
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:17,710
in the z direction being up and
spin in the z direction being

670
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,152
down meaning a vector in
three dimensions pointing up

671
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:22,110
and a vector in three
dimensions pointing down,

672
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,550
because those states
are orthogonal.

673
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,341
Whereas these two
three-dimensional vectors

674
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,230
are not orthogonal--
they're parallel.

675
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,310
They have a non-zero
inner product.

676
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,730
So up and down, the names we
give these spin 1/2 states,

677
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,310
should not be confused with
pointing up in the z direction

678
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,070
and down in the z direction.

679
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,710
It's just a formal name we give
to the plus 1/2 and minus 1/2

680
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,070
angular momentum in
z direction states.

681
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,575
Does that answer your question?

682
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:48,952
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so, when you make

683
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,452
a measurement of
the value of spin--

684
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,517
so perhaps you do a
Stern-Gerlach experiment--

685
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:55,580
and you get what
the spin is, can you

686
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,895
not then say, all right, this
is spin plus 1/2, spin minus?

687
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:04,244
It's as z is positive
1/2 as z is minus 1/2?

688
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:05,410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

689
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,076
So if you do a
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

690
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:09,594
you can identify those
electrons that had spin plus 1/2

691
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,010
and those that had
spin minus 1/2,

692
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,650
and they come out
in different places.

693
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,920
That's absolutely true.

694
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,369
I just want to emphasize
that the up vector does not

695
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,785
mean that they're
somehow attached

696
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:21,840
to the electronic vector that's
pointing in the z direction.

697
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,340
Good.

698
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,840
Yeah.

699
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,050

700
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,000
Go ahead, whichever.

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,580
AUDIENCE: How do we verify that
uncharged particles have spin?

702
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an interesting question.

703
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,690
So the question
is, how do we know

704
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,720
if an uncharged
particle has spin?

705
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,150
And there are many
ways to answer

706
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,877
this question,
one of which we're

707
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,960
going to come to later
which has to do with Bell's

708
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,180
inequality, which is a
sort of slick way to do it.

709
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,640
But a very coarse
way is this way.

710
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,772
We believe, in a deep
and fundamental way,

711
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:50,730
that the total angular
momentum of the universe

712
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,990
is conserved, in
the following sense.

713
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,757
There's no preferred
axis in the universe.

714
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,340
If you're a cosmologist,
just stay out

715
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,881
of the room for the
next few minutes.

716
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,260
So there's no preferred
axis in the universe

717
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,259
and the law of physics should
be invariant under rotation.

718
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,550
Now, if you take a system
that has a bunch of particles

719
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,960
with known angular momentum--
let me give you an example.

720
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,215
Take a neutron.

721
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,990
A neutron has spin 1/2.

722
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,090
Wait, how did I know that?

723
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,960
We can do that experiment by
doing the following thing.

724
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,610
We can take a neutron
and bind it to a proton

725
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,170
and see that the resulting
object has spin 1.

726
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,910
So let me try to think of a way
that doesn't involve a neutron.

727
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:38,020
Grant me for the moment that
you know that a neutron has

728
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,610
spin 1/2.

729
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,340
So let's just imagine that we
knew that, by hook or by crook.

730
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,270
We then do the
following experiment.

731
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,420
We wait.

732
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,180
Take a neutron, let
it sit in empty space.

733
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,430
When that neutron decays,
it does a very cool thing.

734
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,340
It decays relatively
quickly into your proton

735
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,218
and an electron that you see.

736
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:58,676
You see them go flying away
the proton has positive charge,

737
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:01,359
and the electron has negative
charge and it goes flying away.

738
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,400
But you've got a problem.

739
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,285
Because you knew that
the neutron had spin 1/2,

740
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:07,160
which is [INAUDIBLE].

741
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,219
And then you decay one into
a proton and an electron.

742
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,719
And the total angular
momentum there

743
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,150
is 1/2 plus 1/2
or 1/2 minus 1/2.

744
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,850
It's either 1 or 0.

745
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,726
And you've got a problem.

746
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:18,350
Angular momentum
hasn't been conserved.

747
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,929
So what do you
immediately deduce?

748
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,560
That another particle must
have also been emitted

749
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,690
that had 1/2 integer
angular momentum

750
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,150
to conserve angular momentum.

751
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,107
And it couldn't carry any
charge because the electron

752
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:32,440
and the proton were neutral,
and the neutron is neutral.

753
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,497
So things like
this you can always

754
00:34:34,497 --> 00:34:36,330
deduce from conservation
of angular momentum

755
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,204
one way or the other.

756
00:34:37,204 --> 00:34:39,219
But the best way
to do it is going

757
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,151
to be some version of
addition of angular momentum

758
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:44,484
where you have some object
like an electron and a proton

759
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:46,670
and you allow them
to stick together

760
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,380
and you discover it
has total spin 1.

761
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,590

762
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,260
Yeah.

763
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,889
We can talk about that in
more detail afterwards.

764
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,449
That's a particularly nice
way to do the experiment.

765
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:55,949
Yeah.

766
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,374

767
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:00,779
AUDIENCE: Angular momentum
[INAUDIBLE] weird vector

768
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:07,032
since if you reflect your
system through [INAUDIBLE].

769
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:07,977
How does that work?

770
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:09,060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, good.

771
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,500
I don't want to get into
this in too much detail,

772
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,958
but it's a really good question,
so come to my office hours

773
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,850
and ask or go to
recitations and ask.

774
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,016
It's a really good question.

775
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:18,360
The question is this--
angular momentum

776
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,790
has a funny property under
parity, under reflection.

777
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,720
So if you look in a mirror this
way, here's angular momentum

778
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,390
and it's got--
right-hand rule, it's

779
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,473
got angular momentum up--
if I look in the mirror,

780
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:31,270
it's going this way.

781
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:35,520
So it would appear to have
right angular momentum down.

782
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,110
That's what it looks like
if you reflect in a mirror.

783
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,060
Other direction.

784
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,974
So that's a funny property
of angular momentum.

785
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,890
It's also a true property
of angular momentum.

786
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,460
It's fine.

787
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,832
And what about spin,
is the question.

788
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:50,040
Does spin also have this
funny property under parity,

789
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,160
is that basically the question?

790
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,380
Yeah, and it does.

791
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,710
And working out exactly
how to show that

792
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,210
is a sort of
entertaining exercise.

793
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,470
So again, it's beyond
the scope of the lecture,

794
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,630
so come ask me in office hours
and we can talk about that.

795
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,420
Yeah, one more.

796
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,348
AUDIENCE: For orbital angular
momentum, say for l equals 1,

797
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:09,139
we had states like m
equals plus 1 and minus 1.

798
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:09,764
PROFESSOR: Yes.

799
00:36:09,764 --> 00:36:14,400
AUDIENCE: And we did think
of those as angular momentum

800
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,140
vectors.

801
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,495
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

802
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,778
AUDIENCE: But those states are
also orthogonal, are they not?

803
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:19,195
PROFESSOR: Yeah, those
states are also orthogonal.

804
00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:21,794
AUDIENCE: So even though
the angular momentum vectors

805
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:23,210
aren't orthogonal,
they're still--

806
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,497
it's just a different sense.

807
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:25,830
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

808
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,497
So again, even in the case
of integer angular momentum,

809
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:30,080
you've got to be
careful about talking

810
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,440
about the top state
and the bottom state

811
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,960
corresponding to pointing
in some direction,

812
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,680
because they're
orthogonal states.

813
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,180
However, they do correspond to
a particular angular momentum

814
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,770
vector in three
dimensional space.

815
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,980
They correspond to a
distribution on the sphere.

816
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,070
So there's a sense in
which they do correspond

817
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,356
to real rotations, real
eigenfunctions on a sphere,

818
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:49,230
and there's also a sense
in which they don't,

819
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,605
because they're
still orthogonal.

820
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:51,810
That's exactly right.

821
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,580
So let me move on.

822
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,190
I'm going to stop
questions at this point.

823
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,150
So good.

824
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,770
So these are the
properties that need

825
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,140
to be satisfied
by our operators.

826
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,360
And it's pretty easy to
see in this basis what

827
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,850
these operators must be.

828
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,660
Sz has eigenvectors
1, 0 and 0, 1.

829
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,640
So Sz should be equal to h
bar upon 2 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

830
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,480
So let's just check
this on 1, 0 gives me 1,

831
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,550
0, so it gives me the same
thing back times h bar upon 2.

832
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,050
Cool.

833
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,460
And acting on 0, 1,
or the down state,

834
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,270
we get h bar upon
2 times 0 minus 1.

835
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,410
That could be minus 1.

836
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,142
Oh, sorry, 1, 0 gives me 0 and
0 minus 1 on 1 gives me minus 1,

837
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:41,350
which is 1 with a minus sign.

838
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,870
That's a minus sign.

839
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,620
So this works out like a champ.

840
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,790
And S squared, meanwhile,
is equal to-- well,

841
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,810
it's got to give me h
bar squared times 3/4

842
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,715
for both of these vectors.

843
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,340
So h bar squared--
and meanwhile, these

844
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,730
are eigenstates-- h bar squared
times 3/4 times 1, 0, 0, 1.

845
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:04,330

846
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:10,240
So we know one other
fact, which was brought up

847
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,320
just a minute ago, which
was that if we take S plus

848
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,820
and you act on the state
0, 1, what should you get?

849
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,510

850
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,150
If you raise your 1-- 1, 0.

851
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,000
Great.

852
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,609
So we also worked out the
normalization coefficient

853
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,400
on the problem set.

854
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,860
And that normalization
coefficient turns out to be 1.

855
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,600
And let's be careful--
we've got an h

856
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,020
bar, for dimensional
analysis reasons.

857
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,450
So meanwhile, S minus,
similarly, on 0,

858
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,220
1, is equal to 0.

859
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,305
And S plus on 0, 1,
is equal to-- oh,

860
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,430
sorry, we already did that.

861
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,390
We want S minus on 1, 0.

862
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,660
Let's see-- S minus on--
we want S plus on 1,

863
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,740
0 is equal to-- right, 0.

864
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:10,560
And S minus on 1, 0 is
equal to h bar 0, 1.

865
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
OK, so putting
all this together,

866
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,960
you can pretty quickly
get that S plus

867
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,870
is equal to-- we
need an h bar and we

868
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:28,300
need it to raise the lower
one and kill the top state.

869
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,520
So on 1, 0, what does S plus do?

870
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,880
That gives us 0 that gives us 0.

871
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,920
Good.

872
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,409
And on the lowered
state, 0, 1, that

873
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,950
gives me a 1 up top
and that gives me

874
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,810
a 0 downstairs, so it
works out like this.

875
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,650
So we've got h bar.

876
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:48,500
Similarly, S minus is equal
to h bar times 0, 0, 1, 0.

877
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,610

878
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,990
So we've got these
guys-- so much

879
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,606
from just the definitions
of raising and lowering.

880
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,980
And by taking
inner products, you

881
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,540
can just derive those
two lines from these.

882
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:16,140
But notice that Sx is equal
to S plus plus S minus upon 2,

883
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,220
and Sy is equal to S plus
minus S minus upon 2i.

884
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,100

885
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:33,470
So this tells us that Sx is
equal to h bar upon 2 times

886
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,040
S plus-- we're going to
get a 1 here-- plus S

887
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,930
minus-- we're going to
get a 1 here-- 0, 1, 1, 0.

888
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:47,125
And Sy is equal to, again,
upon 2i times h bar, h

889
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:52,590
bar upon 2i, times S plus, which
is going to give me 1 and minus

890
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,540
S minus which is going
to give me minus 1, 0, 0.

891
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,458
But we can pull this i in,
so 1/i is like minus i.

892
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:07,160
So minus i times minus
1 is going to give me i

893
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,580
and minus i times 1
is going to give me i.

894
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,460

895
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,952
So--

896
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:16,422
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
it be minus i?

897
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,130
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

898
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,074
Yeah, did I write i?

899
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,240
That should've been minus i.

900
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,739
Thank you.

901
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,390

902
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,850
So now we have a nice
representation of these spin

903
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,380
operations, of the
spin operators.

904
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:42,730
And explicitly we have that
Sx is equal to h bar upon 2 0,

905
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:50,990
1, 1, 0, Sy is equal to h
bar upon 2 0, minus i, i, 0.

906
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:57,090
And Sz is equal to h bar
upon 2 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

907
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,440

908
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,325
So why is Sz the only
one that's diagonal?

909
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:05,970

910
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,650
Is it something
special about Sz?

911
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,460

912
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,670
AUDIENCE: I mean, we've chosen
z as the axis along which

913
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,370
to project S squared.

914
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,320
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

915
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,930
So the thing that's
special about Sz

916
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,130
is that at the very
beginning of this,

917
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,860
we decided to work in a
basis of eigenstates of Sz,

918
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,220
with definite values of Sz.

919
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,250
So if they have definite
values, then acting with Sz

920
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,740
is just going to
give you a number.

921
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,490
That's what it is to
be a diagonal matrix.

922
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,300
You act on a basis vector,
you just get a number out.

923
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:45,300
So we started out by working
in the eigenbasis of Sz.

924
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:55,515
And as a consequence, we
find that Sz is diagonal.

925
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,140
And this is a general
truth that you'll

926
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:06,320
discover in matrix
mechanics when

927
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,830
you work in the
eigenbasis of an operator,

928
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,980
that operator is represented
by a diagonal matrix.

929
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,600
And so we often say, rather
than to work in an eigenbasis,

930
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,900
we often say, to diagonalize.

931
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,066
Yeah.

932
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,360
AUDIENCE: Are the
signs right for Sy?

933
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,206
Because if we had h bar over
2i, and as we initially had a 1

934
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:27,045
in the top right and minus
1 in the bottom left,

935
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:28,400
shouldn't we just multiply by i?

936
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,316
PROFESSOR: I'm pretty
sure-- so originally, we

937
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,369
had a downstairs i, right?

938
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:34,160
So let's think about
what this looked like.

939
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,161
This was 1 and minus 1, right?

940
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:36,660
Agreed?

941
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,850
So this is minus 1 over i.

942
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,760
So we pull in the i.

943
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,230
So that we go from minus
1 to minus 1 over i.

944
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,430
And we go from 1 to 1 over i.

945
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,280
And I claim that one
over i is minus i.

946
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,090
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

947
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,673
PROFESSOR: OK?

948
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:52,400
And minus 1 over i is i.

949
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,003
That cool?

950
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:53,830
Good.

951
00:43:53,830 --> 00:44:00,860
OK, so this is i and minus i.

952
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,380
I always get that
screwy, but it's

953
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,740
useful to memorize
these matrices.

954
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,210
You might think it's a little
silly to memorize matrices.

955
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,630
But these turn out to
be ridiculously useful

956
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,880
and they come up all the time.

957
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,140
This is called sigma x.

958
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,986
This is called sigma y.

959
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,110
And this is called sigma z.

960
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,820
And different people decide
whether to put the 1/2 in there

961
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,020
or not, the h bar
does not go in there.

962
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,722
Some people put in the 2, some
people don't put in the 1/2,

963
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:25,680
it's a matter of taste.

964
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,150
Just be careful and be
consistent, as usual.

965
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,550
And these are called the
Pauli matrices because A,

966
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,822
we really like Pauli and
B, Pauli introduced them.

967
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:39,480
Although he didn't actually
introduce them in some sense--

968
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,890
this mathematical
structure was introduced

969
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,380
ages and ages and ages ago.

970
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,370
But physicists cite
the physicist, not

971
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,850
the mathematician.

972
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,310
OK I'm not saying that's good.

973
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,600
I'm just saying it happens.

974
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,255
So notice a
consequence of these.

975
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,380
An important consequence
of these-- the whole point

976
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,700
here was to build a
representation of the spin

977
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,620
operators.

978
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,490
Now whatever else the
spin operators do,

979
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,620
they had better satisfy
that computation relation,

980
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,180
otherwise they're not
really spin operators.

981
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,200
That's what we mean by
being spin operators.

982
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
So let's check.

983
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,892
Is it true that Sx commutator
with Sy is equal to i h bar Sz?

984
00:45:17,892 --> 00:45:19,330
So this is a question mark.

985
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,590

986
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,270
And let's check.

987
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,660
Let's do the commutator.

988
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,900
From the Sx, we're going
to get an h bar upon 2.

989
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,530
From the Sy, from each Sy, we're
going to get a factor of h bar

990
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,155
upon 2, so I'll just write that
as h bar upon 2 squared-- times

991
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,690
the commutator of two
matrices-- 0, 1, 1,

992
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,730
0 commutator with
0, minus i, i, 0.

993
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,250

994
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,990
This is equal to h bar
squared upon 4 times--

995
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,990
let's write this out.

996
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,250
The first term is going to be
this matrix times this matrix.

997
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,690
That's going to be, again,
a matrix-- 0, 1, 0, 1.

998
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,030
So that first one is a 1.

999
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,360
0, 1, minus i-- oh,
sorry, that's an i.

1000
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,890
0, 1, that's an i,
that's a minus i.

1001
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,056
So 0, 1, 0, i gives me an i.

1002
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:06,770
0, 1, minus i, 0 gives me a 0.

1003
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,380
Second row-- 1, 0,
0, i gives me 0.

1004
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,180
And 1, 0, minus i,
0 gives me minus i.

1005
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,790
And then the second term is
the flipped order, right?

1006
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:18,680
The commutator term.

1007
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,680
So we get minus the commutator
term, which is going to be 0,

1008
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,180
minus i, 0, 1.

1009
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,500
That gives me minus i.

1010
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,620
0, minus i, 1, 0,
that gives me 0.

1011
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,830
Bottom row-- i, 0, 0, 1-- 0.

1012
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,430
And i, 0, 1, 0 give me i.

1013
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,150
OK, so notice what
we get this is

1014
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,040
equal to h bar squared upon 4.

1015
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,650
And both of those matrices
are the same thing.

1016
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:52,170
Those matrices are both i, 0,
0, minus i with minus i, 0, 0,

1017
00:46:52,170 --> 00:47:02,190
i, giving us i, 0, 0, minus
i times 2 from the two terms.

1018
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,370
The 2's cancel,
and this gives me

1019
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:13,600
h bar squared upon 2
times i, 0, 0, minus i.

1020
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:23,050
But this is also known as--
pulling out an i and an h bar--

1021
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,520
times h bar upon 2
1, 0, 0, minus 1.

1022
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,610
This is equal to i h bar Sz.

1023
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,580

1024
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,710
So these matrices represent
the angular momentum

1025
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,460
commutators quite nicely.

1026
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,544

1027
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:44,460
And in fact, if you
check, all the commutators

1028
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,510
work out beautifully.

1029
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,110
So quickly, just
as a reminder, what

1030
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,690
are the possible
measurable values

1031
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,020
of Sz for the spin 1/2 system?

1032
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,834

1033
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:58,250
What possible
values could you get

1034
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,050
if you measured Sz,
spin in the z direction?

1035
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:05,720
Yeah, plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

1036
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,050
Now what about the eigenvectors?

1037
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,870
What are they-- of Sz?

1038
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,492

1039
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,200
In this notation,
there are these states.

1040
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,991
There's one eigenvector,
there's the other.

1041
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:19,970
But let's ask the same
question about Sx.

1042
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,150
So for Sx, what are the
allowed eigenvalues?

1043
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,530

1044
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,295
Well, we can answer
this in two ways.

1045
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,420
The first way we can answer
this is by saying look,

1046
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,235
there's nothing deep about z.

1047
00:48:30,235 --> 00:48:32,100
It was just the stupid
direction we started with.

1048
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,490
We could have started by working
with the eigenbasis of Sx

1049
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,364
and we would've found
exactly the same story.

1050
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:38,100
So it must be plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

1051
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,230
But the reason you make
that argument is A,

1052
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,330
it's slick and B,
it's the only one

1053
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,680
you can make without knowing
something else about how

1054
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,330
Sx acts.

1055
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,620
But now we know what Sx is.

1056
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,220
Sx is that operator.

1057
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,570
So now we can ask, what are the
eigenvalues of that operator?

1058
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:58,920
And if you compute the
eigenvalues of that operator,

1059
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,700
you find that there
are two eigenvalues

1060
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:07,970
Sx is equal to h
bar upon 2 and Sx

1061
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,746
is equal to minus h bar upon 2.

1062
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:24,910

1063
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,744
And now I can ask, well,
what are the eigenvectors?

1064
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:29,160
Now, we know what
the eigenvectors

1065
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,534
are because we
can just construct

1066
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,080
the eigenvectors of Sx plus.

1067
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,370
And if you construct the
eigenvectors of Sx plus--

1068
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,560
should I take the time?

1069
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,460
How many people want me to
do the eigenvectors of Sx

1070
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,210
explicitly?

1071
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,880
Yeah, that's kind
of what I figured.

1072
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,560
OK, good.

1073
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,520
So the eigenvectors of Sx
are, for example, on 1,

1074
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:55,550
1 is equal to-- well, Sx
on 1, 1, the first term,

1075
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,547
that 0, 1, is going
to give me a 1, the 1,

1076
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:58,630
0 is going to give me a 1.

1077
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,130
So this is h bar upon 2
coefficient of Sx on 1, 1.

1078
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:08,560
And Sx on 1, minus 1 is going
to give me h bar upon 2 minus 1,

1079
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,380
minus 1, because
all Sx does is swap

1080
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,120
the first and second components.

1081
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,610
So it gives me minus
1, takes it to the top,

1082
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,200
but that's just an
overall minus sign.

1083
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,480
So again, we have the correct
eigenvalues, plus and minus

1084
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,290
h bar upon 2, and now
we know the eigenvector.

1085
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,410
So what does this tell us?

1086
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,720
What does it tell us that
up in the x direction

1087
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,410
is equal to 1 over root 2 if
I normalize things properly.

1088
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,384
Up in the z direction plus
down in the z direction.

1089
00:50:35,384 --> 00:50:36,675
That's what this is telling me.

1090
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:42,780

1091
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,720
This vector is equal to up
in the z direction-- that's

1092
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,280
this guy-- plus down
in the z direction.

1093
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,630

1094
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,307
But this isn't
properly normalized,

1095
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:56,515
and properly normalizing it
gives us this expression.

1096
00:50:56,515 --> 00:51:00,010

1097
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,514
So what does this tell us?

1098
00:51:01,514 --> 00:51:03,930
This tells us that if we happen
to know that the system is

1099
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,990
in the state with angular
momentum, or spin,

1100
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,590
angular momentum in the x
direction being plus 1/2, then

1101
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,640
the probability to measure
up in the z direction

1102
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,210
in a subsequent
measurement is 1/2.

1103
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,610
And the probability to
measure down is 1/2.

1104
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,630
If you know it's up
in the x direction,

1105
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,190
the probability of measuring
up in the z or down in the z

1106
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,822
are equal.

1107
00:51:26,822 --> 00:51:27,530
You're at chance.

1108
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,299
You're at even odds.

1109
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:30,340
Everyone agree with that?

1110
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,530
That's the meaning
of this expression.

1111
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,580
And similarly, down in the
x direction is equal to 1

1112
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,820
over root 2, up
in the z direction

1113
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,130
minus down in the z direction.

1114
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,730
And we get that from here.

1115
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:48,810
This state is explicitly, by
construction, the eigenstate

1116
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,200
of Sx as we've constructed Sx.

1117
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,940
And we have a natural
expression in terms

1118
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,602
of the z eigenvectors
up and down.

1119
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,310
That's what this
expression is giving us.

1120
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,910
It gives us an expression
of the Sx eigenvector

1121
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,400
in the basis of Sz eigenvectors.

1122
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,410

1123
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,590
So for example, this tells
you that the probability

1124
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:12,940
to measure up in the
z direction, given

1125
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,272
that we measured down
in the x direction

1126
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:17,230
first-- so this is the
conditional probability.

1127
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,470
Suppose I first measured
down in the x direction,

1128
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,219
what's the probability
that I subsequently

1129
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,580
measure up in the z direction?

1130
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,450
This is equal to--
well, it's the norm

1131
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,640
squared of the
expansion coefficient.

1132
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,910
So first down in the x
direction and the probability

1133
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:37,424
that we're up in the z direction
is 1 upon root 2 squared.

1134
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:38,840
Usual rules of
quantum mechanics--

1135
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,090
take the expansion coefficient,
take its norm squared,

1136
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,470
that's the probability-- 1/2.

1137
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:48,875

1138
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:54,090
And we can do exactly
the same thing for Sy.

1139
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,190

1140
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,196
So let's do the
same thing for Sy

1141
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:03,070
without actually working
out all the details.

1142
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:11,060

1143
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:17,920
So doing the same thing for
Sy, up in the y direction

1144
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,070
is equal to 1 upon root 2 times
up in the z direction plus i

1145
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,460
down in the z direction.

1146
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,642
And down in the y direction
is equal to 1 upon root 2

1147
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:38,400
up in the z direction minus
i down in the z direction.

1148
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,790
And I encourage you to
check your knowledge

1149
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,339
by deriving these
eigenvectors, which

1150
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:45,130
you can do given our
representations of Sy.

1151
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,770

1152
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:51,020
Now here's a nice thing that
we're going to use later.

1153
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,160
Consider the following.

1154
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,470
Consider the operator
S theta, which

1155
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:02,984
I'm going to define as cosine
theta Sz plus-- oh, sorry.

1156
00:54:02,984 --> 00:54:04,650
I'm not even going
to write it that way.

1157
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,800
So what I mean by S
theta is equal to-- take

1158
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,380
our spherical directions and
consider an angle in the-- this

1159
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:22,910
is x, let's say, y, x, z--
consider an angle theta down

1160
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:31,700
in the zx plane, and we
can ask, what is the spin

1161
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,330
operator along the
direction theta?

1162
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:37,170
What's the angular momentum
in the direction theta?

1163
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,469
If theta, for example, is
equal to pi/2, this is Sx.

1164
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:43,010
So I'm just defining
a spin operator,

1165
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,426
which is the angular momentum
along a particular direction

1166
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:47,610
theta in the xz plane.

1167
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,025
Everyone cool with that?

1168
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:51,150
This is going to turn out
to be very useful for us,

1169
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,389
and I encourage you to
derive the following.

1170
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:55,180
And if you don't derive
the following, then

1171
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,760
hopefully it will be
done in your recitations.

1172
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,910
Well, I will chat with your
recitation instructors.

1173
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,970
And if you do
this, then what are

1174
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,050
we going to get for the
eigenvalues of S theta?

1175
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,530

1176
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,510
What possible eigenvalues
could S theta have?

1177
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:17,915

1178
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:18,790
[? AUDIENCE: None. ?]

1179
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:19,022
PROFESSOR: Good.

1180
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:19,610
Why?

1181
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,960
AUDIENCE: Because it can't
have any other redirection

1182
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,387
[INAUDIBLE] no matter
where you start.

1183
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,220
PROFESSOR: Fabulous.

1184
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:25,720
OK.

1185
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,280
So the answer that
was given is that it's

1186
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,690
the same, plus or
minus h bar upon 2

1187
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,719
as Sz, or indeed as Sx or
Sy, because it can't possibly

1188
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:35,760
matter what direction you
chose at the beginning.

1189
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,950
I could have called
this direction theta z.

1190
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,300
How do you stop me?

1191
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,080
We could have done that.

1192
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,184
We didn't.

1193
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:43,600
That was our first
wave answering.

1194
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,260
Second wave answering is what?

1195
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,230
Well, construct the
operator S theta

1196
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,115
and find its eigenvectors
and eigenvalues.

1197
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,365
So I encourage you to do that.

1198
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:58,290
And what you find
is that, of course,

1199
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,110
the eigenvalues are plus
or minus h bar upon 2

1200
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:09,140
and up at the angle theta is
equal to cosine of theta upon 2

1201
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:13,020
up in the z direction
plus sine of theta

1202
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,310
upon 2 down in the z direction.

1203
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:21,540
And down theta is
equal to cosine theta

1204
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:27,930
upon 2 up in the z direction
minus sine of theta

1205
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:35,050
over 2 down in the z direction.

1206
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:35,872
Oops, no.

1207
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:36,580
I got that wrong.

1208
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,530
This is sine, and
this is minus cosine.

1209
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,624
Good.

1210
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:41,540
That makes more sense.

1211
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,020

1212
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,520
OK.

1213
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,822
So let's just sanity check.

1214
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,530
These guys should be
properly normalized.

1215
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,190
So if we take the norm
squared of this guy,

1216
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,175
the cross terms vanish
because up z and down z

1217
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:54,366
are orthogonal states.

1218
00:56:54,366 --> 00:56:56,740
So we're going to get a co
squared plus the sine squared.

1219
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,240
That's 1.

1220
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,551
So that's properly normalized.

1221
00:56:58,551 --> 00:56:59,550
Same thing for this guy.

1222
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,570
The minus doesn't
change anything

1223
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,569
because we norm squared.

1224
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,271
Now, I'll check that
they're orthogonal.

1225
00:57:03,271 --> 00:57:05,770
If we take this guy dotted into
this guy, everything's real.

1226
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:09,700
So we get a cosine
from up up, we're

1227
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,022
going to get a cosine sine.

1228
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:13,480
And from down down, we're going
to get a minus cosine sine.

1229
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,287
So that gives us 0.

1230
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:15,870
So these guys are
orthogonal, and they

1231
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,630
satisfy all the nice
properties we want.

1232
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:25,245
So this is a good check--
do this-- of your knowledge.

1233
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:27,120
And if we had problem
sets allowed this week,

1234
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,080
I would give you this in your
problem set, but we don't.

1235
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,879

1236
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:36,830
Yeah, OK.

1237
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:44,737

1238
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:45,695
Suppose that I measure.

1239
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,880
So I want to use these
states for something.

1240
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:58,330
Suppose that I
measure Sz and find

1241
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:02,690
Sz is equal to 1/2 h
bar plus h bar upon 2,

1242
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,010
OK, at some moment in time.

1243
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:10,232

1244
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:11,190
First question is easy.

1245
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,190
What's the state of the system
subsequent to that measurement?

1246
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,004

1247
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:19,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1248
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,777
PROFESSOR: Man, you
all are so quiet today.

1249
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:24,110
What's the state of the system
subsequent to measurement

1250
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:26,695
that Sz is plus h bar upon 2?

1251
00:58:26,695 --> 00:58:28,406
AUDIENCE: Up z.

1252
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:29,080
PROFESSOR: Up z.

1253
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,580
Good.

1254
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:36,700
So our state psi is
up z upon measurement,

1255
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,915
OK, after measurement.

1256
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:48,540

1257
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,805
And I need new chalk.

1258
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:51,305
OK.

1259
00:58:51,305 --> 00:58:54,480

1260
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:04,316
Now, if I measure Sx, so 1, 2,
measure Sx, what will I get?

1261
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:07,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1262
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,300
PROFESSOR: OK.

1263
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,726
What values will I observe
with what probabilities?

1264
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:13,600
Well, first off, what
are the possible values

1265
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,607
that you can measure?

1266
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:16,010
AUDIENCE: Plus or
minus h bar over 2.

1267
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,801
PROFESSOR: Right, the
possible eigenvalues,

1268
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:20,760
so which is plus or minus
h bar upon 2, but with what

1269
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,720
probability?

1270
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,595
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1271
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:23,386
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1272
00:59:23,386 --> 00:59:25,200
So we know this from
the eigenstate of Sx.

1273
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,040
If we know that we're
in the state up z,

1274
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,400
we can take linear
combinations of this guy

1275
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,810
to show that up z is
equal to 1 over root 2.

1276
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,090
So let's just check.

1277
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,460
If we add these two
together, up x and down x,

1278
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,240
if we add them
together, we'll get 1/2,

1279
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:50,810
1/2, 2/2, a root 2 times up
z, is up x plus down x, up x

1280
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:56,060
plus down x, dividing
through by the 1/2.

1281
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,290
So here we've expressed
up in the z direction

1282
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,810
in a basis of x and y, which
is what we're supposed to do.

1283
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,920
So the probability that
I measure a plus 1/2

1284
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:11,016
as x is equal to
plus 1/2 h bar upon 2

1285
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:14,290
is equal to 1 over
root 2 squared, so 1/2.

1286
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:19,780
And ditto, Sx is equal
to minus h bar upon 2.

1287
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,271
Same probability.

1288
01:00:21,271 --> 01:00:21,770
OK?

1289
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:22,740
What about Sy?

1290
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:28,680

1291
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,310
Again, we get one of two values.

1292
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:33,770
Oops, plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

1293
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:38,070
But the probability of
measuring plus is equal to 1/2,

1294
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:47,050
and the probability that we
measure minus 1/2 is 1/2.

1295
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,310
That's h bar upon 2.

1296
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:49,810
OK?

1297
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,018
So this should look familiar.

1298
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:54,920

1299
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,040
Going back to the
very first lecture,

1300
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,260
hardness was spin
in the z direction,

1301
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:05,624
and color was spin in
the x direction, I guess.

1302
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:07,290
And we added, at one
point, a third one,

1303
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,230
which I think I
called whimsy, which

1304
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:12,740
is equal to spin
in the y direction.

1305
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,240
OK?

1306
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,085
And now all of the
box operation that we

1307
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:17,210
used in that very first
lecture, you can understand

1308
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,140
is nothing other than
stringing together

1309
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,100
chains of Stern-Gerlach
experiments

1310
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,630
doing Sx, Sy, and Sz.

1311
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,182
So let's be explicit about that.

1312
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:29,510
Let's make that concrete.

1313
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,760
Actually, let's do that here.

1314
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,900
So for example, suppose
we put a random electron

1315
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,691
into an Sz color box.

1316
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:44,190
OK.

1317
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,620
Some are going to
come out up, and some

1318
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:51,520
are going to come out
down in the z direction.

1319
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,210
And if we send this into
now an Sx color box,

1320
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,610
this is going to give us
either up in the x direction

1321
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,070
or down in the x direction.

1322
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:06,200
And what we'll get
out is 50-50, right?

1323
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:06,700
OK.

1324
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,040
So let's take the ones
that came out down.

1325
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,450
And if we send those back
into an Sz, what do we get?

1326
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,770
AUDIENCE: 50-50.

1327
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:21,450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 50-50,
because down x is 1 over 2 up z

1328
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,091
plus 1 over 2 down z.

1329
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,340
What was going on in that
very first experiment, where

1330
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,200
we did hardness,
color, hardness?

1331
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,650
Superposition.

1332
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,680
And what superposition
was a hard electron?

1333
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,320
It was 1 over a 2,
white plus black.

1334
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,130
We know precisely which
superposition, and here it is.

1335
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:40,890
OK?

1336
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,990
And now, let's do that
last experiment, where

1337
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:51,510
we take these guys, Sx down, and
I'm turning this upside down,

1338
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:52,140
beam joiners.

1339
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,059
We take the up in the x
direction and the down

1340
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:58,100
in the x direction, and
we combine them together,

1341
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:02,772
and we put them back
into Sz, what do we get?

1342
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:03,730
Well, what's the state?

1343
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:09,600
1 over root 2 down x
plus 1 over root 2 up x?

1344
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1345
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,580
PROFESSOR: It's up z.

1346
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,640
Up z into an Sz
box, what do we get?

1347
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,285
Up z with 100%.

1348
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:22,220

1349
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,660
That's white with 100%, or
I'm sorry, hard with 100%.

1350
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
down z with a down z.

1351
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:28,650
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

1352
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,462
AUDIENCE: You put in down.

1353
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:30,420
PROFESSOR: Oh, I put in down.

1354
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,128
Shoot, I'm sorry.

1355
01:03:31,128 --> 01:03:32,910
Well, yeah, indeed,
I meant to put in up.

1356
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,510
Yes, down z with
100% confidence.

1357
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,230
If we remove the mirror, 50-50.

1358
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,932
If we add in the mirror, 100%.

1359
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:40,390
And the difference
is whether we're

1360
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:42,740
taking one component
of the wave function,

1361
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:46,054
or whether we're superposing
them back together.

1362
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:47,010
All right?

1363
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,970
Imagine we know we have
a system in this state,

1364
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:52,590
and I say, look, this component
is also coincidentally very far

1365
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:55,190
away, and I'm going
to not look at them.

1366
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,656
So of the ones that I look
at, I have 1 over root 2 up x.

1367
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:00,030
But if I look at
the full system,

1368
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:03,370
the superimposed system,
that adds together

1369
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,890
to be an eigenstate of Sz.

1370
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,498
These are our color boxes.

1371
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:08,998
Yeah?

1372
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:09,736
AUDIENCE: But how
do you know, when

1373
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:11,458
you put the two beams
to the beam joiner,

1374
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,545
it serves to add their
two states together?

1375
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:14,670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, excellent.

1376
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:15,870
This is a very subtle point.

1377
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,420
So here we have to decide what
we mean by the beam splitter.

1378
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,420
And what I'm going to
mean by the beam splitter,

1379
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,510
by the mirrors
and beam joiners--

1380
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,150
so the question is, how do
we know that it does this

1381
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,860
without changing
the superposition?

1382
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,600
And what I want to do
is define this thing

1383
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,410
as the object that takes the
two incident wave functions,

1384
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,780
and it just adds them together.

1385
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,530
It should give me the
direct superposition

1386
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,570
with the appropriate
phases and coefficients.

1387
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,870
So if this was plus up x,
then it stays plus up x.

1388
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,470
If it's minus up x, it's
going to be minus up x.

1389
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,700
Whatever the phase is of
this state, when it gets here

1390
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,780
it just adds together
the two components.

1391
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,570
That's my definition
of that adding box.

1392
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,687
AUDIENCE: So realistically,
what does that look like?

1393
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:55,520
PROFESSOR: Oh, what?

1394
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,895
You think I'm an
experimentalist?

1395
01:04:56,895 --> 01:04:57,630
[LAUGHTER]

1396
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,600
Look, every time I
try an experiment,

1397
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,910
I get hit by a shark.

1398
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:01,410
OK?

1399
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,320
[LAUGHTER]

1400
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,500
Yeah, no.

1401
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,480
How you actually implement
that in real systems

1402
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,890
is a more complicated story.

1403
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,330
So you should
direct that question

1404
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:14,720
to Matt, who's a very
good experimentalist.

1405
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,350
OK.

1406
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:19,570
So finally, let's go back to
the Stern-Gerlach experiment,

1407
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,080
and let's actually run the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

1408
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,241
I guess I'll do that here.

1409
01:05:24,241 --> 01:05:26,740
So let's think about what the
Stern-Gerlach experiment looks

1410
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,010
like in this notation, and
not just in this notation,

1411
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:32,590
in the honest language of spin.

1412
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,934
And I'm going to do a slightly
abbreviated version of this

1413
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:37,600
because you guys can
fill in the details

1414
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,981
with your knowledge
of 802 and 803.

1415
01:05:40,981 --> 01:05:41,480
OK.

1416
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,104
So here's the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

1417
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:46,635
We have a gradient in
the magnetic field.

1418
01:05:46,635 --> 01:05:47,635
This is the z direction.

1419
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:52,516
And we have a gradient
where B in the z direction

1420
01:05:52,516 --> 01:06:01,492
has some B0, a
constant plus beta z.

1421
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:02,300
OK?

1422
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,601
So it's got a constant
piece and a small gradient.

1423
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:07,600
Everyone cool with that?

1424
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,495
It's just the magnetic field
gets stronger and stronger

1425
01:06:09,495 --> 01:06:11,160
in the z direction,
there's a constant,

1426
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,500
and then there's a rate of
increase in the z direction.

1427
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,310
And I'm going to send
my electron through.

1428
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:21,090
Now remember, my electron has
a wave function, psi electron,

1429
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,820
is equal to-- well, it's
got some amplitude to be up,

1430
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,500
a up z, plus some amplitude
to be down, b down z.

1431
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,050
And if this is a
random electron,

1432
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,120
then its state is
going to be random,

1433
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,120
and a and b are going to
be random numbers whose

1434
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,710
norm squared add up to
1, proper normalization.

1435
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,247
Cool?

1436
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,705
So here's our random
initial state,

1437
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:40,250
and we send it into
this region where

1438
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,750
we've got a magnetic
field gradient.

1439
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,690
And what happens?

1440
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:51,720
Well, we know that the
energy of an electron that

1441
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:57,170
carries some angular momentum
is a constant, mu naught,

1442
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:59,740
times its angular
momentum dotted

1443
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:03,230
into any ambient magnetic field.

1444
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,810
Whoops, sorry,
with a minus sign.

1445
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,768
This is saying that
magnets want to anti-align.

1446
01:07:06,768 --> 01:07:09,514

1447
01:07:09,514 --> 01:07:10,930
Now, in particular,
here we've got

1448
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,460
a magnetic field
in the z direction.

1449
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:19,280
So this is minus mu 0 Sz Bz.

1450
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:28,210
And Bz was a constant, beta
0-- sorry, B0 plus beta z.

1451
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,090
So the energy has two terms.

1452
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,220
It has a constant term,
which just depends on Sz,

1453
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,720
and then there's a
term that depends

1454
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,435
on z as well as depending
on Sz [INAUDIBLE].

1455
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:42,625
So we can write this as a--
so Sz, remember what Sz is.

1456
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:48,520
Sz is equal to h bar
upon 2, 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

1457
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:57,244
So this is a matrix with
some coefficient up a--

1458
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:58,410
do I want to write this out?

1459
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:02,220

1460
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,830
Yeah, I guess I don't really
need to write this out.

1461
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,749
But this is a matrix, and
this is our energy operator.

1462
01:08:08,749 --> 01:08:11,290
And it acts on any given state
to give us another state back.

1463
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,676
It's an operator.

1464
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:14,175
OK.

1465
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:17,189

1466
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:19,240
And importantly,
I want this to be

1467
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:25,637
only-- this is in some
region where we're

1468
01:08:25,637 --> 01:08:28,220
doing the experiment, where we
have a magnetic field gradient.

1469
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,609
Then outside of this region,
we have no magnetic field

1470
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:33,160
and no magnetic field gradient.

1471
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,979
So it's 0 to the left
and 0 to the right.

1472
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:41,310

1473
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:44,470
So as we've talked about
before, the electron

1474
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,649
feels a force due to this
gradient to the magnetic field.

1475
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:49,507
The energy depends on
z, so the derivative

1476
01:08:49,507 --> 01:08:51,090
of the energy with
respect to z, which

1477
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,279
is the force in the z
direction, is non-zero.

1478
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,784
But for the moment that's
a bit of a red herring.

1479
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,950
Instead of worrying about
the center of mass motion,

1480
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,899
let's just focus on
the overall phase.

1481
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:03,420

1482
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:11,140
So let's take our initial
electron with this initial wave

1483
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:17,750
function a up z plus
b down z, and let's

1484
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:23,069
note that in this time-- so
what does this matrix look like?

1485
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:23,569
OK.

1486
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:26,479
So fine, let's actually
look at this matrix.

1487
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,910
So Sz is the matrix 1, 0, 0,
minus 1 times h bar upon 2.

1488
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:39,580
So we have h bar
upon 2 minus mu 0.

1489
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,465
And then B0 plus beta
z, which I'll just

1490
01:09:41,465 --> 01:09:47,779
write as B, which is equal
to some constant C, 0, 0,

1491
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:54,480
some constant minus C.
Everyone agree with that?

1492
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,630
Where a constant, I
just mean it's a number,

1493
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,696
but it does depend on z,
because the z is in here.

1494
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:04,626

1495
01:10:04,626 --> 01:10:05,750
Now, here's the nice thing.

1496
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:14,390
When we expand the energy on
up z, this is equal to C of z

1497
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:19,180
up z, because there's
our energy operator.

1498
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:26,685
And energy on down z is equal
to minus Cz of z down to z.

1499
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,060
So up and down in
the z direction

1500
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:31,250
are still eigenfunctions
of the energy operator.

1501
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,970
We've chosen an
interaction, we've

1502
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:35,100
chosen a potential which
is already diagonal,

1503
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,390
so the energy is diagonal.

1504
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:39,450
It's already in its eigenbasis.

1505
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:44,760
So as a consequence, this is the
energy, energy of the up state

1506
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,270
is equal to, in the z
direction, is equal to plus C.

1507
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:53,180
And energy in the down state,
energy of the down state,

1508
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:56,654
is equal to minus C of z.

1509
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,080
Everyone agree with that?

1510
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,760
So what this magnetic
field does it

1511
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,050
splits the degeneracy of
the up and down states.

1512
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,424
The up and down
states originally

1513
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:04,520
had no energy splitting.

1514
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,990
They were both zero energy.

1515
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,865
We turn on this magnetic
field, and one state

1516
01:11:07,865 --> 01:11:09,531
has positive energy,
and the other state

1517
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,480
has negative energy.

1518
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,570
So that degeneracy
has been split.

1519
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:16,410
Where did that original
degeneracy come from?

1520
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,410
Why did we have a degeneracy
in the first place?

1521
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:19,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1522
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,460
PROFESSOR: Spherical symmetry.

1523
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,300
And we turn on the magnetic
field, which picks out

1524
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,049
a direction, and we
break that degeneracy,

1525
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:26,080
and we lift the splitting.

1526
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,090
OK?

1527
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,090
So here we see that the
splitting is lifted.

1528
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,970
And now we want to ask, how
does the wave function evolve

1529
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:31,260
in time?

1530
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,920
So this was our
initial wave function.

1531
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,450

1532
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:39,089
But we know from the Schrodinger
equation that psi of t

1533
01:11:39,089 --> 01:11:41,130
is going to be equal to--
well, those are already

1534
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:52,600
eigenvectors-- so a e to the
minus i e up t upon h bar up z

1535
01:11:52,600 --> 01:12:07,009
plus b e to the minus i e
down t upon h bar down z.

1536
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:07,508
All right?

1537
01:12:07,508 --> 01:12:23,260
But we can write this as equals
a e to the i mu 0 b0 t over 2

1538
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:39,450
plus i mu 0 beta t z upon 2 up
z plus b same e to the minus

1539
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,520
i--oops, that should be,
oh, no, that's plus--

1540
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,855
that's e to the i
mu 0 b0 t over 2.

1541
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:49,250

1542
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,240
And if we write this
as two exponentials,

1543
01:12:51,240 --> 01:13:00,130
e to the minus i mu 0
beta t z upon 2-- oh no,

1544
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,081
that's a minus,
good, OK-- down z.

1545
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:02,580
OK.

1546
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,090
So what is this telling us?

1547
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,840
So what this tells us
is that we start off

1548
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,430
in a state, which has
some amplitude to be up

1549
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,085
and some amplitude
to be down, a and b.

1550
01:13:13,085 --> 01:13:16,420
And at a later
time t, sine of t,

1551
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,360
what we find after we run
it through this apparatus

1552
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,760
is that this is the amplitude.

1553
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,760
What do you notice?

1554
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,260
Well, we notice two things.

1555
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,200
The first is that
the system evolves

1556
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,190
with some overall energy.

1557
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:32,820
So the phase rotates as usual.

1558
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,700
These are energy
eigenstates, but the amount

1559
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,991
of phase rotation depends on z.

1560
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:40,640
So in particular, this is e
to the i some number times z.

1561
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,550
And what is e to the
i some number times z?

1562
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:46,430

1563
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,870
If you know you have a state
that's of the form e to the i

1564
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:52,101
some number, which I will, I
don't know, call kz times z,

1565
01:13:52,101 --> 01:13:53,850
what is this telling
you about the system?

1566
01:13:53,850 --> 01:14:00,085

1567
01:14:00,085 --> 01:14:01,710
This is an eigenstate
of what operator?

1568
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,580
AUDIENCE: Momentum.

1569
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,540
PROFESSOR: Momentum
in the z direction.

1570
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,800
It carries what momentum?

1571
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,591
AUDIENCE: h bar kz.

1572
01:14:05,591 --> 01:14:07,280
PROFESSOR: h bar kz, exactly.

1573
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,310
So what about this?

1574
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,319
If I have a system
in this state,

1575
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:12,610
what can you say about its
momentum in the z direction?

1576
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:16,019

1577
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:17,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1578
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,660
PROFESSOR: It's non-zero.

1579
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,580
Right here's a z.

1580
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,871
These are a bunch of constants.

1581
01:14:20,871 --> 01:14:23,450
It's beta, t, mu 0, 2, i.

1582
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,790
So it's non-zero.

1583
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:28,406
In fact, it's got minus
some constant times z.

1584
01:14:28,406 --> 01:14:29,140
Right?

1585
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,700
So this is a state
with negative momentum.

1586
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,360
Everyone agree?

1587
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,100
It's got momentum z
down in the z direction.

1588
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,770
What about this guy?

1589
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,440
Momentum up.

1590
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,842
So the states that are up in
the z direction get a kick up.

1591
01:14:43,842 --> 01:14:45,800
And the states that are
down in the z direction

1592
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,466
get a kick down.

1593
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:50,000
They pick up some momentum
down in the z direction.

1594
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,500
Yeah?

1595
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,870
AUDIENCE: Where did
that big T come from?

1596
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:56,010
PROFESSOR: Big T should
be little t, sorry.

1597
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:58,960
Sorry, just bad
handwriting there.

1598
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,960
That's just t.

1599
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,903
Yeah?

1600
01:15:00,903 --> 01:15:03,801
AUDIENCE: So in this
case, the eigenvalues--

1601
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:04,767
it's a function of z?

1602
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:05,733
PROFESSOR: Mhm.

1603
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:07,864
AUDIENCE: Is that allowable?

1604
01:15:07,864 --> 01:15:08,530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1605
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,840
So that seems bad, but remember
what I started out doing.

1606
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,367
Oop, did I erase it?

1607
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:14,200
Shoot, we erased it.

1608
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,540
So we started out saying,
look, the wave function is up

1609
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,400
in the z direction, or
really rather here, up

1610
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,274
in the z direction
times some constant.

1611
01:15:21,274 --> 01:15:23,190
Now, in general, this
shouldn't be a constant.

1612
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,799
It should be some function.

1613
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,840
So this should be a function
of position times up

1614
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,490
in the z direction.

1615
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,770
This is a function position
times down in the z direction.

1616
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,145
So what we've done here is we
said, under time evolution,

1617
01:15:32,145 --> 01:15:36,330
that function changes
in time, but it

1618
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,020
stays some linear
combination up and down.

1619
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,100
So you can reorganize this as--
the time evolution equation

1620
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,455
here is an equation for
the coefficients of up z

1621
01:15:44,455 --> 01:15:46,189
and the coefficient of down z.

1622
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:46,730
AUDIENCE: OK.

1623
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:49,880

1624
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,100
PROFESSOR: Other questions?

1625
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:52,620
OK.

1626
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,160
So the upshot of all this is
that we run this experiment,

1627
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,810
and what we discover is that
this component of the state

1628
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:03,370
that was up z gets a kick
in the plus z direction.

1629
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,580
And any electron that
came from this term

1630
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,860
in the superposition
will be kicked up up z.

1631
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,930
And any electron that came
from the superposition down z

1632
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,274
will have down.

1633
01:16:15,274 --> 01:16:17,690
Now, what we really mean is
not that an electron does this

1634
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:19,900
or does that, but rather
that the initial stage

1635
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,360
of an electron that's here,
with the superposition of z

1636
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,610
up and down, ends up in the
state as a superposition of up

1637
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:31,874
z being up here and
down z being down here.

1638
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:32,417
OK?

1639
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,500
An electron didn't do one,
it didn't do the other.

1640
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,950
It ends up in a superposition,
so the state at the end.

1641
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,170
So what the Stern-Gerlach
experiment has done,

1642
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,530
apparatus has done,
is it's correlated

1643
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,540
the position of the
electron with its spin.

1644
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:50,590
So if you find the amplitude,
to find it up here and down

1645
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:51,270
is very small.

1646
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,820
The amplitude to find it up
here and up is very large.

1647
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,500
Similarly, the amplitude, to
find it down here and up is 0.

1648
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:02,710
And the amplitude, to find it
down here and down is large.

1649
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:03,390
Cool?

1650
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,610
So this is exactly what
we wanted from the boxes.

1651
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:08,250
We wanted not to do
something funny to the spins,

1652
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,690
we just wanted to correlate
the position with the spin.

1653
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,480
And so the final state is a
superposition of these guys.

1654
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,480
And which superposition?

1655
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,450
It's exactly this superposition.

1656
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:19,575
So these calculations are
gone through in the notes

1657
01:17:19,575 --> 01:17:20,930
that are going to be posted.

1658
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,520
OK.

1659
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,930
So questions at this point?

1660
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:25,430
Yeah?

1661
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,179
AUDIENCE: And so when
you put the electron

1662
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:28,559
through the
Stern-Gerlach device,

1663
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:30,975
does that count as a measurement
of the particle's angular

1664
01:17:30,975 --> 01:17:31,450
momentum?

1665
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,325
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

1666
01:17:32,325 --> 01:17:34,760
When I put the electrons through
the Stern-Gerlach device,

1667
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,660
do they come out with
a definite position?

1668
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,560
AUDIENCE: No.

1669
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:37,690
PROFESSOR: No.

1670
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,070
At the end of the
experiment, they're

1671
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:41,160
in a superposition of either
being here or being here.

1672
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,826
And they're in a
superposition of either

1673
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,140
being up spin or down spin.

1674
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,270
Have we determined the
spin through putting it

1675
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,530
through this apparatus?

1676
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:49,030
No.

1677
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,310
We haven't done any measurement.

1678
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,434
The measurement comes when
we now do the following.

1679
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,800
We put a detector here
that absorbs an electron.

1680
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,185
We say, ah, yeah, it got hit.

1681
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,060
And then you've measured
the angular momentum

1682
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,740
by measuring where it came out.

1683
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:02,740
If it comes out down here,
it will be in the positive.

1684
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,805
So this is a nice example of
something called entanglement.

1685
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:07,930
And this is where we're
going to pick up next time.

1686
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,600
Entanglement says the following.

1687
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,230
Suppose I know one
property of a particle,

1688
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:19,870
for example, that it's up here,
or suppose I'm in the state psi

1689
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:30,430
is equal to up, so up here
and up in the z direction plus

1690
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:36,280
down there and down
in the z direction.

1691
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,482
OK?

1692
01:18:37,482 --> 01:18:39,940
This means that, at the moment,
initially, if I said, look,

1693
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,273
is it going to be up or down
with equal probabilities, 1

1694
01:18:42,273 --> 01:18:44,800
over root 2 with
equal amplitudes,

1695
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,560
if I measure spin in
the z direction, what

1696
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,325
value will I get?

1697
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:50,860

1698
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,430
What values could
I get if I measure

1699
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,241
spin in the z direction?

1700
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:54,990
Plus or minus 1/2.

1701
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:56,531
And what are the
probabilities that I

1702
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:58,170
measure plus 1/2 or minus 1/2?

1703
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1704
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,280
PROFESSOR: Even odds, right?

1705
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,330
We've done that experiment.

1706
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,300
On the other hand, if
I tell you that I've

1707
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,360
measured it to be up
here, what will you then

1708
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,980
deduce about what its spin is?

1709
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:14,946
AUDIENCE: Plus.

1710
01:19:14,946 --> 01:19:16,070
PROFESSOR: Always plus 1/2.

1711
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,600
Did I have to do the
measurement to determine

1712
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,391
that it's plus 1/2.

1713
01:19:18,391 --> 01:19:21,200

1714
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,760
No, because I already
know the state,

1715
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,920
so I know exactly what I will
get if I do the experiment.

1716
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,940
I measure up here, and
then the wave function

1717
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,290
is this without the 1 over
root 2, upon measurement.

1718
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:31,498
But as a consequence, if I
subsequently measure up z,

1719
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:34,820
the only possible value
is up in the z direction.

1720
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,346
Yeah?

1721
01:19:36,346 --> 01:19:38,660
And this is called entanglement.

1722
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:46,809
And here it's entanglement of
the position with the spin.

1723
01:19:46,809 --> 01:19:48,350
And next time, what
we'll do is we'll

1724
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,710
study the EPR experiment,
which says the following thing.

1725
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,220
Suppose I take two electrons,
OK, take two electrons,

1726
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,720
and I put them in the state one
is up and the other is down,

1727
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,840
or the first is up and
the second is down.

1728
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,530
All right?

1729
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,610
So up, down plus down, up.

1730
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,120
OK?

1731
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,890
I now take my two electrons, and
I send them to distant places.

1732
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:12,150
Suppose I measure one of them
to be up in the x direction.

1733
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,570
Yeah?

1734
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,451
Then I know that the other
one is down in that direction.

1735
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:16,950
Sorry.

1736
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,010
If I measure up in
the z direction,

1737
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,590
I determine the other one
is down in the z direction.

1738
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:22,449
But suppose someone over here
who's causally disconnected

1739
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:23,990
measures not spin
in the z direction,

1740
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,940
but spin in the x direction.

1741
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:28,890
They'll measure one of two
things, either plus or minus.

1742
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,670
Now, knowing what we know,
that it's in the z eigenstate,

1743
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:36,690
it will be either plus 1/2 in
the x direction or minus 1/2

1744
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:38,210
in the x direction.

1745
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,270
Suppose I get both measurements.

1746
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:42,630
The distant person over here
does the measurement of z

1747
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:46,180
and says, aha, mine is up, so
the other one must be down.

1748
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,830
But the person over here doesn't
measure Sz, they measure Sx,

1749
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:51,254
and they get that it's plus Sx.

1750
01:20:51,254 --> 01:20:53,170
And what they've done
as a result of these two

1751
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:55,340
experiments, Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen say,

1752
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,460
is this electron has been
measured by the distant guy

1753
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:05,500
to be spin z down, but by this
guy to be measured spin x up.

1754
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,139
So I know Sx and Sz definitely.

1755
01:21:10,139 --> 01:21:12,680
But that flies in the face of
the uncertainty relation, which

1756
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,250
tells us we can't have spin
z and spin x definitely.

1757
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,122
Einstein and Podolsky
and Rosen say

1758
01:21:18,122 --> 01:21:20,080
there's something missing
in quantum mechanics,

1759
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,496
because I can do
these experiments

1760
01:21:21,496 --> 01:21:26,440
and determine that this
particle is Sz down and Sx up.

1761
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:32,840
But what quantum
mechanics says is

1762
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,202
that I may have done
the measurement of Sz,

1763
01:21:35,202 --> 01:21:36,660
but that hasn't
determined anything

1764
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:37,850
about the state over here.

1765
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,600
There is no predetermined value.

1766
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,620
What we need to do is
we need to tease out,

1767
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:45,130
we need an experimental
version of this tension.

1768
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:47,444
The experimental
version of this tension,

1769
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,860
fleshed out in the
EPR experiment,

1770
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,010
is called Bell's inequality.

1771
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,670
We studied it in the
very first lecture,

1772
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,211
and we're going to show it's a
violation in the next lecture.

1773
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:55,470
See you guys next time.

1774
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,020
[APPLAUSE]

1775
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:09,107
