00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:23,062

10
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:26,099
PROFESSOR: Any questions
from last lecture

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,140
from before spring break?

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,369

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,800
No questions, nothing?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,090
Nothing at all?

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,610
We you all still on vacation?

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,750
Thank you.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,556
Yeah.

18
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,185
AUDIENCE: Could you talk
about coherence states?

19
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:45,890
PROFESSOR: Ah.

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,690
OK, well, that's
a great question.

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,640
So coherence states--
actually, how many people

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,420
have looked at the
optional problems?

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,170
Nice, OK, good.

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,550

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,270
Good, so coherence
states were a topic

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,750
that we touched on
the problem sets

27
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,570
and on the optional problems,
and the optional problems

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:20,052
are mostly on the harmonic
oscillator and nice problems

29
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:22,510
revealing some of the structure
of the harmonic oscillator,

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,114
and it generalizes quite boldly.

31
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:27,030
But here's the basic
idea of coherence states.

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,040
Let me just talk you
through the basic ideas

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,510
rather than do any calculations.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,987
So what's the ground state
of a harmonic oscillator?

35
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:36,570
What does its wave
function look like?

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,256
AUDIENCE: Gaussian.

37
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,560
PROFESSOR: It's a
Gaussian, exactly.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,101
It's minimum
uncertainty wave packet.

39
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,460
How does it evolve in time?

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
AUDIENCE: Phase.

41
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,520
PROFESSOR: Yeah, phase.

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
It's an energy eigenstate,
it's the ground state,

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,760
so it just evolves in
time with the phase.

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,030
So if we look at the wave
function for the ground

45
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,850
state, phi naught, it's
something like e to the minus x

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,472
squared over 2a squared with
some normalization coefficient,

47
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,930
which I'm not going
to worry about.

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,830

49
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,074
So this is a minimal
uncertainty wave packet.

50
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:06,990
Its position distribution
is time independent,

51
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,980
because it's a
stationary statement.

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,188
It's momentum distribution,
which is also a Gaussian,

53
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:13,570
the Fourier transform,
is time independent.

54
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,420
And so this thing up to its
rotation by the overall phase

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,510
just sits there and
remains a Gaussian.

56
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,340
Now, here's a question.

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,610
Suppose I take my harmonic
oscillator potential,

58
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,020
and I take my Gaussian, but
I displace it a little bit.

59
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,530
It's the same ground
state, it's the same state

60
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,730
but I've just displaced
it over a little.

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,370
What do you expect to happen?

62
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,470
How will this state
evolve in time?

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,980
So, we know how to
solve that problem.

64
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,580
We take this state, it's a
known wave function at time 0.

65
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,040
We expand it in the basis
of energy eigenstates,

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,910
each energy eigenstate
evolves in time with a phase,

67
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,220
so we put in that
phase and redo the sum,

68
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,262
and recover the time
evolution of the full state.

69
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,636
And we've done this a number
of time on the problem sets.

70
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:03,162
Yeah.

71
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:10,220
AUDIENCE: Would the Gaussian,
the displaced Gaussian

72
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,338
evolve the same
way, keep its width,

73
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,310
if it had any
other initial width

74
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,581
other than the one
of the ground state?

75
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:21,080
PROFESSOR: Let me
come back to that,

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,121
because it's a little more
of a precise question.

77
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,460

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,340
So we know how to solve
this problem practically,

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,560
algorithmically.

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,666
But here's a nice fact.

81
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm not going to derive
any equations, that's

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,650
part of the point of
the optional problems,

83
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,560
but here's a nice
fact about this state.

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,601
So it's clearly a minimum
uncertainty wave packet

85
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,750
because at time 0,
because it's just

86
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,620
the same Gaussian just
translated over a little bit.

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,480
So what we'd expect,
naively, from solving

88
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,530
is we expand this
in Fourier modes

89
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,420
and then we let this the
system evolve in time.

90
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,740
We let each individual
Fourier mode--

91
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,130
or, sorry, Fourier mode-- we
let each individual energy

92
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,080
eigenstate evolve in time, pick
up a phase, and now what we get

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
is a superposition.

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,280
Instead of sum over
n at time 0, we'd

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,770
have sum over n cn phi n of x.

96
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,422
Now, as a function of time,
we get e minus I omega nt,

97
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,630
and these phases are going
to change the interference

98
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,647
from summing up all
these energy eigenstates,

99
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,230
and so the system
will change in time.

100
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,019
Because the way that the various
terms in the superposition

101
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,625
interfere will change in time.

102
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,750
So very naively, what you
might expect, if you just

103
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,190
took a random
function-- for example,

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,980
if I took a harmonic
oscillator potential

105
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,800
and I took some stupid function
that did something like this.

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,590
What would you expect
it to do over time?

107
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,020
Well, due to all the complicated
interference effects,

108
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,190
you'd expect this to turn
into, basically, some schmutz.

109
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,586
Just some crazy
interference pattern.

110
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,460
The thing that's nice
about a coherent state,

111
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,000
and this is where
it gets its name,

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,930
is the way that all of
these interference effects

113
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,950
conspire together to evolve
the state is to leave it

114
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,610
a Gaussian that does nothing
but translates in time.

115
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,600
A coherent state is coherent
because it remains coherently

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
a Gaussian as it moves along.

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,610
It oscillates back and forth.

118
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,200
And in fact, the peak, the
center of this Gaussian wave

119
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,040
packet, oscillates with
precisely the frequency

120
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,070
of the trap.

121
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,930
It behaves just as a classical
particle would have had you

122
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,560
displaced it from the center of
the harmonic oscillator trap,

123
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,850
it oscillates back and forth.

124
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,507

125
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,590
Now, on the other hand,
you know that its momentum

126
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,276
is changing in time, right.

127
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,650
And at any given
point, as you've

128
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,680
shown on the problem set
that's due tomorrow--

129
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,610
or you will have shown-- at
any given moment in time,

130
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,790
the momentum can be understood
as the overall phase.

131
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,630
You could just change that
momentum by the overall phase,

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,741
so it's the spatial rate
of change of the phase, e

133
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:49,960
to the ikx.

134
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,890
So you know that the way the
phase depends on position

135
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,400
is changing over time.

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
So it can't be quite so simple
that the wave function, rather

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,370
than the probability
distribution,

138
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,850
is remaining a
Gaussian over time.

139
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,010
It's not, it's got all
sorts of complicated phases.

140
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,060
But the upshot is that the
probability distribution

141
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,180
oscillates back and forth
perfectly coherently.

142
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,010
So that seems a little
magical, and there's a nice way

143
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,150
to understand how
that magic arises,

144
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,240
and it's to understand
the following.

145
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,380
If I take a state, phi 0, but
I translate it x minus x0.

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,790
OK.

147
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,514
So we know that this
state, phi 0 of x,

148
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,930
was the ground
state, what does it

149
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,887
mean to be the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator?

150
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,470
How do I check if
I'm the ground state

151
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,700
of the harmonic oscillator?

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,221
Look, I walk up to
you, I'm like, hey,

153
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,220
I'm the ground state of
the harmonic oscillator.

154
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,880
You're suspicious.

155
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,530
What do you do?

156
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,470
AUDIENCE: Annihilate.

157
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,050
PROFESSOR: Annihilate.

158
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,620
Exactly.

159
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,870
You act with the
annihilation operator.

160
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,810
Curse you.

161
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,129
So you act with the annihilation
operator and you get 0, right.

162
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,670
What happens if I act with the
annihilation operator on this?

163
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,720
Is this the ground state?

164
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,381
No, it's been displaced by x0.

165
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,880
And meanwhile, I told you that
it oscillates back and forth.

166
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,296
So what happens if you act
with the annihilation operator?

167
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,260
Should you get 0?

168
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,510
No, what are you going to get?

169
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,240
AUDIENCE: Something weird.

170
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,824
PROFESSOR: Some
random schmutz, right?

171
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,989
If you just take a and you
act on some stupid state,

172
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,670
you'll just get some
other stupid state.

173
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,397
Except for Gaussians
that have been displaced,

174
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,980
you get a constant
times the same wave

175
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,700
function, phi 0 of x minus x0.

176
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,810
Aha.

177
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,630
It turns out that these
displaced Gaussians

178
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,140
are eigenstates of the
annihilation operator.

179
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,610
What does that mean?

180
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,200
Well, it means they're
coherent states.

181
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,070
And so the optional
problems are a working

182
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,870
through of the study
of the eigenfunctions

183
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,710
of the annihilation operator,
the coherent states.

184
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,810
Is that cool?

185
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,505
It's a state, it's
a superposition.

186
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:49,880
You can think
about it like this.

187
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,036
It's a superposition of
the energy eigenstate.

188
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,160
Any state is a superposition
of energy eigenstates,

189
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,076
and a coherent state is
just some particularly

190
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,810
special superposition
of energy eigenstates.

191
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,710
So you can think about
it literally as c0 phi

192
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,620
0 plus c1 phi 1 plus c2
phi 2, blah blah blah.

193
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,160
What does the
annihilation operator

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,960
do, what does the
lowering operator do?

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,501
It takes any state
and then lowers it

196
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,490
with some coefficient.

197
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,190
So a coherent state, an
eigenstate of the annihilation

198
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,550
operator, must be a
state such that if you

199
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,914
take c 0 phi 0 plus
c1 phi 1 plus c2 phi 2

200
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,080
and you hit it with the
annihilation operator, which

201
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,690
will give you see c1 phi 0 plus
c2 phi 1 divided by root 2 plus

202
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,554
dot, dot, dot-- or times
root 2 plus dot, dot, dot.

203
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,929
It gives you the
same state back.

204
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,570
So that gave you a relation
between the coefficients c0

205
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,110
and c1, c1 and c2, c2 and c3.

206
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,280
They've all got to be suitable
multiples of each other.

207
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,550
And what you can show-- and this
is something you work through,

208
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,055
not quite in this order, on
the optional problems-- what

209
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:50,190
you can show is that
doing so it gives you

210
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,240
a translated Gaussian.

211
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,710
OK.

212
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,990
So physically, that's
what a coherent state is.

213
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,520
Another way to say what
a coherent state is,

214
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,850
it's as close to
a classical object

215
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,610
as you're going
to get by building

216
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,460
a quantum mechanical
wave function.

217
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,450
It's something that behaves
just like a classical particle

218
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,890
in that potential
would have behaved,

219
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,460
in the harmonic
oscillator potential.

220
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,710
Did that answer your question?

221
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,420
OK.

222
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,080
Anything else?

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,110
So, Matt works with
these for a living.

224
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,708
Matt, do you want
to add anything?

225
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,666
All right.

226
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,020

227
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,440
I like these.

228
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,190
They show up all over the place.

229
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,465
This is like the spherical
cow of wave functions

230
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:35,340
because it's awesome.

231
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,550
It's an eigenfunction, it's
an annihilation operator,

232
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,285
it behaves like a
classical particle.

233
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:42,790
AUDIENCE: Is there an easy
way to define coherent states

234
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,690
in potentials where you don't
have nice operators like a?

235
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,630
PROFESSOR: No, I
mean, that's usually

236
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,070
what we mean by
a coherent state.

237
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,350
So the term coherent state
is often used interchangeably

238
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,041
to mean many different
things, which

239
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,290
in the case of the harmonic
oscillator, are identical.

240
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,520
One is a state
which is a Gaussian.

241
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,020
OK.

242
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,680
So in the harmonic
oscillator system,

243
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,930
that's a particularly nice
state because it oscillates

244
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,984
particularly nicely and it
maintains its probability

245
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,400
distribution as a function of
time roughly by translating,

246
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,316
possibly, some phases.

247
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:15,834

248
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,750
But people often use the
phrase coherent state

249
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,690
even when you're not harmonic.

250
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,480
And it's useful to keep in mind
that we're often not harmonic,

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,590
nothing's truly harmonic.

252
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,470
You had another question
a moment ago though,

253
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,550
and your question
was about the width.

254
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,050
Yeah.

255
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,890
AUDIENCE: It just translates
without changing its width,

256
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,020
with or without changing
its shape at all.

257
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,811
If the Gaussian were
of a different width,

258
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,810
would that still happen?

259
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it does,
although the details of how

260
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,630
it does so are
slightly different.

261
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,710
That's called a squeeze state.

262
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,460
The basic idea of a
squeeze state is this.

263
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,790
Suppose I have a
harmonic oscillator--

264
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,030
and this is actually
one way people

265
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,640
build squeeze
states in labs-- so

266
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,413
suppose I have a
harmonic oscillator

267
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:54,130
and I put the system
in a ground state.

268
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,296
So there's its ground state.

269
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:59,290
And its width is correlated with
the frequency of the potential.

270
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,814

271
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:03,230
Now, suppose I
take this potential

272
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,230
at some moment in time and
I control the potential,

273
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,790
the potential is created by
some laser field, for example.

274
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,440
And some annoying grad student
walks over to the control panel

275
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,840
and doubles the
power of the laser.

276
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,227
All of a sudden, I've
squeezed the potential.

277
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:22,560
But my system is already in
a state which is a Gaussian,

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,530
it's just the wrong Gaussian.

279
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,620
So what does this guy do?

280
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,453
Well, this is funny.

281
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,964
The true ground state,
once we've squeezed,

282
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:31,630
the true ground state
would be something

283
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,701
that's much narrower
in position space.

284
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:36,200
I didn't draw that
very well, but it

285
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,554
would be much narrower
in position space,

286
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:39,970
and thus its
distribution would be

287
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,000
much broader in momentum space.

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
So the state that
we put the system,

289
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,940
or we've left the system in, has
too much position uncertainty

290
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,070
and too little
momentum uncertainty.

291
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,840
It's been squeezed compared
to the normal state

292
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,200
in the delta x delta p plane.

293
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,442
It's uncertainty relation
is still extreme,

294
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,650
it still saturates the
uncertainty bound because it's

295
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,050
a Gaussian, but it doesn't have
the specific delta x and delta

296
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,340
p associated with
the true ground

297
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,190
state of the squeezed potential.

298
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,980
OK, so now you can ask what
does this guy do in time.

299
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,910
And that's one of the
optional problems, too,

300
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,410
and it has many of the nice
properties of coherent states,

301
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,541
it's periodic, it evolves much
like a classical particle,

302
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,040
but it's uncertainties
are different

303
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,240
and they change shape.

304
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,770
It's an interesting story,
that's the squeezed state.

305
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,632
Yeah.

306
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:29,040
AUDIENCE: Do other
potentials have

307
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,962
coherent states
that are Gaussian?

308
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,260
PROFESSOR: It sort of depends.

309
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,170
So other potentials have
states that behave classically.

310
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:37,750
Yeah.

311
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,550
There are generally-- so
systems that aren't the harmonic

312
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,950
oscillator do have very
special states that

313
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,070
behave like a
classical particle.

314
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,380
But they're not as
simple as annihilations

315
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,260
by the annihilation operator.

316
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,718
Come to my office
and I'll tell you

317
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:55,530
about analogous
toys for something

318
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,210
called supersymmetric
quantum models,

319
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,030
where there's a
nice story there.

320
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,150
OK.

321
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,460
I'm going to cut off coherent
states for the moment

322
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,950
and move on to where we are now.

323
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,770
OK, so last time we
talked about scattering

324
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,950
of a particle, a quantum
particle of mass m

325
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,322
against a barrier.

326
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:20,780
And we made a
classical prediction,

327
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,180
which I didn't quite
phrase this way.

328
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,596
But we made a
classical prediction

329
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:27,640
that if you took this
particle of mass m

330
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,880
and threw it against a
barrier of height v0,

331
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,180
that the probability
that it will transmit

332
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,135
across this barrier to
infinity is basically 0.

333
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,635
So this is the
classical prediction.

334
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:44,600

335
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,390
It will not transmit to
infinity until the energy goes

336
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,927
above the potential.

337
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,510
And when the energy is above the
potential, it will slow down,

338
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,720
but it will transmit
100% of the time.

339
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,871

340
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,370
So this is our
classical prediction.

341
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,340

342
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,840
And so we sought to solve
this problem, we did.

343
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,260
It was pretty straightforward.

344
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,555
And the energy eigenstate
took the form-- well,

345
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:12,930
we know how to
solve it out here,

346
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,940
we know how to
solve it out here,

347
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,900
because these are just
constant potentials

348
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,420
so it's just plain waves.

349
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,130
Let's take the
case of the energy

350
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,920
is less than the potential.

351
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
So this guy.

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,027
Then out here, it's in a
classically disallowed state,

353
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,360
so it's got to be a exponential.

354
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,026
If we want it to be
normalized, well, we

355
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,575
need it to be a
decaying exponential.

356
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:32,200
Out here it's
oscillatory, because it's

357
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,610
a classically allowed region.

358
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,610
And so the general form of the
wave function of the energy

359
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,320
eigenstate is a superposition
of a wave moving this way

360
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,960
with positive momentum, a
wave with negative momentum,

361
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,700
a contribution with
minus k, and out here it

362
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,370
had to be the
decaying exponential.

363
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,210
And then by matching, requiring
that the wave function was

364
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,480
oscillatory and then
exponentially decaying out

365
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,119
here, and requiring that it was
continuous and differentiably

366
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,160
continuous-- that its
derivative was continuous--

367
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,510
we found matching
conditions between

368
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,926
the various
coefficients, and this

369
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,440
was the solution in general.

370
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,940
OK.

371
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,260

372
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,090
Now, in particular,
this term, which

373
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,830
corresponds to the component
of the wave function moving

374
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,740
towards the barrier on the left
hand side, has amplitude 1.

375
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,370
This term, which corresponds
to a wave on the left

376
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,360
with negative momentum,
so moving to the left,

377
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,390
has amplitude k minus i
alpha over k plus i alpha,

378
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,470
where h bar squared
k squared upon 2m

379
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,100
is equal to-- that's just the
energy, e-- and h bar squared

380
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,600
alpha squared over 2m--
that's on this side-- is

381
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,590
equal to v0 minus e.

382
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,940

383
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,640
But this, notably,
is a pure phase.

384
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,484
And we understood that, so
we'll call this parameter r,

385
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,900
because this is
the reflected wave

386
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,100
and this is an amplitude
rather than a probability,

387
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,183
so we'll call it little r.

388
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:06,200

389
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,450
And we notice that
the probability

390
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,285
that we get out-- good.

391
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,910
So if we want to ask
the question, what

392
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,368
is the transmission probability,
the probability that I get

393
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:19,210
from far out here to far out
here, what is that probability?

394
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,600

395
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,364
So if I consider a state that
starts out as a localized wave

396
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,530
packet way out here and I
send it in but with energy

397
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,250
below the barrier,
what's the probability

398
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,460
that I'll get
arbitrarily far out here,

399
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,880
that I will subsequently find
the particle very far out here?

400
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,866
0, right, exactly.

401
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,990
And you can see that because
here's the probability

402
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,910
amplitude, the norm
squared is the probability

403
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,610
density as a function
of the position.

404
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,470
And it goes like a constant
times e to the minus alpha x.

405
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,770
For large x, this
exponential kills us.

406
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,540
And we made that more precise
by talking about the current.

407
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,330
We said look, the
current that gets

408
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,980
transmitted is equal to-- that's
a funny way to write things.

409
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,840
H bar-- sorry.

410
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,520
The current that
gets transmitted,

411
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:10,650
which equal to h bar upon
2mi psi complex conjugate dx

412
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:17,936
psi minus psi dx psi complex
conjugate on the right.

413
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,359
So we'll put right,
right, right, right.

414
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,859
This is just equal to
0, and the easiest way

415
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,359
to see that is
something you already

416
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,839
showed on a problem set.

417
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,630
The current vanishes
when the wave function

418
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,650
can be made real up to a phase.

419
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,960
And since this is some
number, but in particular it's

420
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,870
an overall constant
complex number,

421
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,310
and this is a real
wave function,

422
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,140
we know that this is 0.

423
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,640
So the transmitted
current out here is 0.

424
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,950
The flux of particles moving
out to the right is 0.

425
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,876

426
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,250
So nothing gets
out to the right.

427
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,040
So that was for the energy
less than the potential,

428
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,440
and we've now
re-derived this result,

429
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,580
the classical prediction.

430
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,305
So the classical prediction
worked pretty well.

431
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,100
Now, importantly,
in general, we also

432
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,537
wanted to define the
transmission probability

433
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,120
a little more
carefully, and I'm going

434
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,850
to define the
transmission probability

435
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,270
as the current of
transmitted particles

436
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,580
on the right divided by the
current of probability that

437
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,460
was incident.

438
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,450
And similarly, we can
define a probability

439
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,640
that the particle
reflects, which

440
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,320
is the ratio of the reflected
current, the current

441
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,650
of the reflected beam,
to the incident current.

442
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,370

443
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,600
So this is going to be the
transmission probability

444
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,891
and the reflection probability.

445
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:42,721

446
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,220
Yeah.

447
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,460
AUDIENCE: Is there
a square on t?

448
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,580
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

449
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,700

450
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,340
OK.

451
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,150
So let's do a slightly
different example.

452
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,750
In this example, I want to
study the same system, the wall,

453
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,705
but I want to consider
a ball incident

454
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,182
from the left-- a ball.

455
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:05,390
An object, a quantum particle
incident from the left,

456
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,499
with energy greater
than v. Greater than v0.

457
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,790
So again, classically, what
do you expect in this case.

458
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,640
You send in the particle, it
loses a little bit of energy

459
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,570
going up the potential
barrier, but it's still

460
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,070
got a positive kinetic energy,
and so it just keeps rolling.

461
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,580

462
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,680
Just like my car making
it up the driveway,

463
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,950
just barely makes it.

464
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,690

465
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,400
OK.

466
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,350
So here again, what's the
form of the wave function.

467
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,600
Phi e can be put in
the form on the left.

468
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,970
It's going to be e to the
ikx plus b to the minus ikx,

469
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,120
and that's over
here on the left.

470
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,286
And on the right it's
going in the form ce

471
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:53,510
to the ik-- in fact, let me call
this k1x and k2x-- or sorry,

472
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,680
k1x, which is on the left.

473
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:03,077
H bar squared k1 squared
upon 2m is equal to e.

474
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,660
And on the right, we're going
to have k2x because it's, again,

475
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,076
a classically
allowed region, it's

476
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:09,720
going to be oscillatory but
with a different momentum.

477
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,370
e to the ik2x plus
de to the minus ik2x

478
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:22,890
where h bar squared
k2 squared upon 2m

479
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,110
is equal to e minus v0,
which is a positive number,

480
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,874
so that's good.

481
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:28,040
So here's our wave function.

482
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,194

483
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,610
Now, before we do
anything else, I

484
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,210
want to just interpret
this quickly.

485
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,954
So again, this is like a wave
that has positive momentum,

486
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:44,370
and I'm going to say that it's
like a contribution, a term

487
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,572
in the superposition, that
is moving to the right,

488
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:48,905
and the way to think of it
as moving to the right, well,

489
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,020
first off, it's got
positive momentum.

490
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,277
But more to the point, this
is an energy eigenstate.

491
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,860
So how does this
state evolve in time?

492
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,767

493
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,350
It's an energy
eigenstate with energy,

494
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,520
how does it evolve in time.

495
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

496
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,480
PROFESSOR: It rotates by
an overall phase, exactly.

497
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,271
So we just get this
times an e to the minus

498
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:08,039
i omega t, where h bar omega
is equal to e, the energy.

499
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,580
And that's true on
the left or right,

500
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,050
because the energy
is just a constant.

501
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,830
So this term goes as
e to the ikx minus i

502
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,050
omega t, or kx minus omega t.

503
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,660
And this is a point
of constant phase

504
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,871
in this move to the right.

505
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,120
As t increases-- in order
for the phase to be constant

506
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,570
or for the phase, for example,
to be 0-- as t increases,

507
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,920
x must increase.

508
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,680
By assumption here, k
is a positive number.

509
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,380
On the other hand, this guy--
that was a k1-- the second term

510
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,790
is of the form e
to the minus ik1x,

511
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,800
and when I add the omega
t, minus i omega t,

512
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,244
this becomes kx plus omega t.

513
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,160
So point of constant
phase, for example, phase

514
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,450
equals 0, in order for this to
stay 0 then, as t increases,

515
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,449
x must become negative.
x must decrease.

516
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,990
So that's why we
say this corresponds

517
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,170
to a component of
the wave function,

518
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,030
a term in the superposition
which is moving to the left.

519
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,660
And this is one which
is moving to the right.

520
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,950
Sorry, my right, your left.

521
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,950
Sorry, this is
moving to your right

522
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,415
and this is moving to your left.

523
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:11,900
OK?

524
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,150
It's that little z2, it's
harder than it seems.

525
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,740
OK.

526
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,110
In this set up, we could
imagine two different kinds

527
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,560
of scattering experiments.

528
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,310
We can imagine a
scattering experiment

529
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,179
where we send in a particle from
the left and ask what happens.

530
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,970
So if you send in a
particle from the left,

531
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,414
what are the logical
possibilities?

532
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:31,580
AUDIENCE: It can go through.

533
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,410
PROFESSOR: It could
go through, or?

534
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,390
AUDIENCE: Reflect back.

535
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,980
PROFESSOR: Reflect back.

536
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,354
Are you ever going to get a
particle spontaneously coming

537
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:38,620
from infinity out here?

538
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,120
Not so much.

539
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,161
So if you're sending a
particle in from the left,

540
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:44,030
what can you say about
these coefficients?

541
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,472
d equals 0 and a
is not 0, right.

542
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:48,680
Because d corresponds to a
particle on the right hand

543
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,590
side coming in this way.

544
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,480
So that's a different
scattering experiment.

545
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,570
So in particular,
coming in from the left

546
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,790
means d equals 0 and
a not equal to 0.

547
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,580

548
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:12,250
Coming in from the right
means a equals 0 and d

549
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,741
not equal to 0 by
exactly the same token.

550
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,240
Cool?

551
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,270

552
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,750
So I want to emphasize this.

553
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,480
a and d, when you think of
this as a scattering process, a

554
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
and d are in guys.

555
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,850
In, in.

556
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,810
And c and b are out.

557
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,090
This term corresponds to
moving away from the barrier,

558
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,339
this term corresponds to
moving away from the barrier,

559
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:39,960
just on the left
or on the right.

560
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,770
OK?

561
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,849
Out and out.

562
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:45,890
Everyone happy with that?

563
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,127
Yeah.

564
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:52,020
AUDIENCE: According to that
graph, if d is-- no, that one.

565
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,520
Yeah.

566
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,570
If d is bigger than [INAUDIBLE]
then the transplants will be 1.

567
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,814
Doesn't that mean
that d is also 0?

568
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:06,180
PROFESSOR: So this is
the classical prediction.

569
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,680
I've written it,
classical prediction.

570
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,590
So let me rephrase.

571
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,580
The question was
basically, look,

572
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,180
that classical
prediction implies

573
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,700
that b must be 0 on the
other scattering process,

574
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,040
and that doesn't sound right.

575
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,765
So is that true?

576
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:23,015
No, it's not true, and we'll
see it again in a second.

577
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:25,760
So very good intuition.

578
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,510
That was good.

579
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,060
OK, good.

580
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,470
So in general, if we have
a general wave function,

581
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,920
general superposition of the
two states with energy e with

582
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,060
a,b,c, and d all
non-0, that's fine.

583
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,010
That just corresponds
to sending some stuff

584
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,120
in from the right and
some stuff in-- sorry,

585
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,170
some stuff in from the left and
some stuff in from the right.

586
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,606
Yeah?

587
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,230
But it's, of course,
going to be easier

588
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,240
if we can just do a
simpler experiment.

589
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,670
If we send in stuff
from the left or send in

590
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,560
stuff from the right.

591
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,887
And if we solve those
problems independently,

592
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:00,470
we can then just
superpose the results

593
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,900
to get the general solution.

594
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,410
Yeah.

595
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,310
So it will suffice
to always either set

596
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,522
d to 0 or a to 0,
corresponding to sending things

597
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:08,730
in from the left or sending
things in from the right.

598
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,955
And then we can just take
a general superposition

599
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,424
to get the general answer.

600
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,465
Everyone happy with that?

601
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:15,290

602
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,550
So let's do that in this set up.

603
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,460
So here's our wave function.

604
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,900
And you guys are now adept at
solving the energy eigenvalue

605
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,564
equation, it's just the matching
conditions for a,b,c, and d.

606
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:27,980
I'm not going to
solve it for you,

607
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,040
I'm just going to
write down the results.

608
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,140
So the results-- in fact,
I'll use a new border.

609
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,730

610
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,120
The results for this guy,
now for e greater than v,

611
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,270
are that-- doo doo doo,
what just happened.

612
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,019
Right, OK, good.

613
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,060
So let's look at the case
d equal 0 corresponding

614
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,832
to coming in from the left.

615
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,290
So in the case of
in from the left,

616
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:03,620
c is equal to 2k1
over k1 plus k2,

617
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,800
and b is equal to k1
minus k2 over k1 plus k2.

618
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,110

619
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,490
And this tells us, running
through the definition of j,

620
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,130
the currents, and t and r, gives
us that, at the end of the day,

621
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,780
the reflection coefficient is
equal to k1 minus k2 upon k1

622
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,790
plus k2 [INAUDIBLE] squared,
whereas the transmission

623
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:40,090
amplitude or probability
is equal to 4k1 k2 over k1

624
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,900
plus k2 squared.

625
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,450

626
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,870
And a good exercise for
yourself is to re-derive this,

627
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,540
you're going to have to do that
on the problem set as a warm

628
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,259
up for a problem.

629
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,800
So at this point
we've got an answer,

630
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,870
but it's not terribly satisfying
because k1 and k2, what's

631
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,630
the-- so let's put
this in terms of a more

632
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,980
easily interpretable form.

633
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,290
k1 and k2 are nothing other
than code for the energy

634
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,996
and the energy
minus the potential.

635
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:11,370
Right, so we must be able to
rewrite this purely in terms

636
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,700
of the energy in the
potential e and v. In fact,

637
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,920
if we go through and
divide both top and bottom

638
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,480
by k1 squared for
both r and t, this

639
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,320
has a nice expression
in terms of the ratio

640
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,030
of the potential to the energy.

641
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,210
And the nice expression is
1 minus the square root of 1

642
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:36,410
minus v0 over e over
1 plus the square root

643
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:42,970
of 1 minus v0 over
e norm squared.

644
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,730
And suddenly, the
transmission amplitude

645
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:54,410
has the form 4 root 1
minus v0 over e over 1

646
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,855
plus the square root of 1
minus v0 over e squared.

647
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,780

648
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,660
I don't remember which
version of the notes

649
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,720
I posted for this year's course.

650
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,280
In the version from
2011 there is a typo

651
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,730
that had here e over v, and
in the version from 2012, that

652
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,790
was corrected in the
notes to being v0 over e.

653
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,820
So I'll check, but let me
just warn you about that.

654
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,940
On one or two pages of
the notes, at some point,

655
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,790
these guys were inverted
with respect to each other.

656
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,414
But the reason to
write this out is now

657
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,220
we can plot the following.

658
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,010
We can now plot the quantum
version of this plot.

659
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,630
We can plot the actual
quantum transmission

660
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,070
as a function of energy,
and the classical prediction

661
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,180
was that at energy
is equal to v0,

662
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,102
we should have a step function.

663
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:45,310
But now you can see that
this is not a step function,

664
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,610
and that's related to the fact
that b was not actually 0,

665
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,100
as you pointed out.

666
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,460
Hold on one sec.

667
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,675
Sorry, was it quick?

668
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,261
AUDIENCE: The notes are wrong.

669
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:58,990
PROFESSOR: OK, the notes
are wrong, good, thank you.

670
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,226
That's great.

671
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:01,350
OK, so the notes are wrong.

672
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,060
It should be v0 over e,
not e over v0 on the notes

673
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,090
that are posted.

674
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,460
We're in the process
of teching them up,

675
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,240
so eventually a beautiful set
of nice notes will be available.

676
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,200

677
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,120
Extra elbow grease.

678
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,710
OK.

679
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,840
So what do we actually see?

680
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,580
Here we got for e
less than v0, we

681
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,090
got in d that the transmission
probability was exactly 0.

682
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,350
So that's a result for
the quantum result.

683
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,720
But when e is equal
to v0, what do we get?

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,660
Well, when e is equal
to v0, this is 1.

685
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,270
And we get square
root of 1 minus 1,

686
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,520
which is square root of
0, over square root of 1

687
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,970
plus square root of 1
minus 1, which is 0.

688
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,200
That's 0 over-- OK, good.

689
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,040
So that's not so bad.

690
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,470
Except for this 1 over this e,
this is a little bit worrying.

691
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,340
If you actually
plot this guy out,

692
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,700
it does this, where
it asymptotes to 1.

693
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,710
And to see that it
asymptotes to 1,

694
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,250
to see that it asymptotes
to 1, just take e0 gigantic.

695
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,040
If you know it's gigantic,
this becomes v0 over e,

696
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,660
which goes to 0, and if e is
much larger than the potential.

697
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,427
So this becomes
square root of 1.

698
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,760
And in the denominator, this
becomes square root of 1, 1

699
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,370
plus 1, that's 2 squared, 4, 4
divided by 4, that goes to 1.

700
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:33,920
So for large e much larger
than v0, this goes to 1.

701
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,440
So we do recover the
classical prediction

702
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,900
if we look at energy
scales very large

703
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,590
compared to the
potential height.

704
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,090
Yeah?

705
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,140

706
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,070
OK.

707
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,380
So that's nice.

708
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,770
Another thing
that's nice to note

709
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,310
is that if you take this
reflection probability

710
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,890
and this transmission
probability,

711
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,930
then they sum up to 1.

712
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,052

713
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:02,510
This turns out to
be a general fact

714
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,410
and it's a necessary
condition in order for those

715
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,784
to be interpretable
as reflection

716
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,290
in transition probabilities.

717
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,095
The probability
that it transmits

718
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:10,650
and the probability that it
reflects had better add to 1,

719
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,514
or something is eating
your particles, which

720
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:14,180
is probably not what
you're looking for.

721
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,460
So this turns out to be true
in this case, just explicitly.

722
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,810
But you can also, as you
will in your problem set,

723
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,350
prove that from that definition
r and t, it's always true.

724
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,330
A check on the sensibility
of our definition.

725
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,182
If it weren't true,
it wouldn't tell you

726
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,640
that quantum
mechanics is wrong, it

727
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,040
would tell you that we
chose a stupid definition

728
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,320
of the transmission and
reflection probabilities.

729
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,924
So in this case, we actually
chose quite an enlightened one.

730
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:40,090
OK, questions at this point?

731
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,838

732
00:31:42,838 --> 00:31:43,754
Yeah.

733
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:45,355
AUDIENCE: Does
this analysis even

734
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:47,082
hold for classical particles?

735
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:49,248
If we're talking about the
difference between-- like

736
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,485
if I threw a baseball and
I happened to throw it

737
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:54,520
at a potential that had height
one millionth of a joule

738
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,186
less than the energy
of the baseball,

739
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:57,310
would we observe this also?

740
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,026
PROFESSOR: No.

741
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:58,800
AUDIENCE: No?

742
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,550
PROFESSOR: No, for
the following reason.

743
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,870
So here's my classical system.

744
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,020
Classical system is
literally some hill.

745
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,650
So where I was
growing up as a kid,

746
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,800
there was a hill not
far from our house.

747
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,050
I'm not even going to go
into it, but it was horrible.

748
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,120

749
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,300
If you have energy just
ever so slightly greater

750
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,230
than the hill-- he said
from some experience--

751
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,118
if you have energy that's
ever so slightly greater-- OK.

752
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,930
I'm going resist the temptation.

753
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:34,030
So one of these days.

754
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,240
If you have ever so slightly
greater than the hill,

755
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,904
and you start up here,
what does that tell you?

756
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:42,570
What does it mean to
say you have energy

757
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,430
just ever so slightly greater
than the potential energy

758
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,060
at that point?

759
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,287
AUDIENCE: Up more slowly.

760
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:48,620
PROFESSOR: Little tiny velocity.

761
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,870
OK, and I'm going to say I
have a little tiny velocity

762
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,580
this way.

763
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,500
OK.

764
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,890
So what happens?

765
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,670
We follow Newton's equations.

766
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,040
They are totally unambiguous,
and what they tell you is,

767
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,060
with 100% certainty, this thing
will roll and roll and roll,

768
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,770
and then all hell
will break loose.

769
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,970
And then if you're
very lucky, your car

770
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,880
gets caught in the trees on
the side of the cliff, which

771
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,330
is later referred to by the
policeman who helps you tow it

772
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,150
out as nature's guard rail.

773
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,860

774
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,190
I was young, it
won't happen again.

775
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,760
And So with 100% certainty,
Newton's equations

776
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
send you right off the cliff.

777
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,340
And for style points, backward.

778
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,930

779
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,170
So now I'm going to
do the second thing.

780
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,430
Newton's laws satisfy
time reversal invariance.

781
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,350
So the time reversal of
this is, this thing has

782
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,160
this much energy, and
it shoots up the cliff.

783
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,250
And ever so slowly,
it just eventually

784
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,470
goes up to the top,
where everything is fine.

785
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,561
OK, but does it ever
reflect back downhill?

786
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,060
No.

787
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,904
And does it ever--
classically, when

788
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,820
you roll the thing--
does it ever actually not

789
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,390
go off the cliff
and hit the trees,

790
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,719
but instead reflect backwards.

791
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,610
I wish the answer were yes.

792
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,550
But sadly, the answer is no.

793
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,730
Now, if that car had been
quantum mechanically small,

794
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,670
my insurance would have
been much more manageable.

795
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,139
But sadly, it wasn't.

796
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,969
OK, so this is a pretty
stark and vivid-- this

797
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,010
is a pretty stark difference
between the quantum

798
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,219
mechanical prediction and
the classical prediction.

799
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,710
Everyone cool with that?

800
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,111
Other questions?

801
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:36,610
Yeah.

802
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,294
AUDIENCE: I understand why
it works out that r plus t

803
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:42,448
equals 1, but I'm
not sure I understand

804
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,489
the motivation to use the
square with the ratios.

805
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,969
PROFESSOR: Excellent, OK.

806
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:51,050
So the reason to do it,
so great, excellent.

807
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,699
How to say.

808
00:34:51,699 --> 00:35:02,416

809
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,790
Here's one way to
think about it.

810
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,914

811
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,330
The first thing
we want is we want

812
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,560
a-- so this is a
very good question,

813
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,230
let me repeat the question.

814
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,938
The question is, look,
why is it squared?

815
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:16,470

816
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,350
Why isn't it linear?

817
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,390
So let's think about that.

818
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,810
Ah, ah, ah.

819
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,450

820
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,310
The reason it's squared
is because of a typo.

821
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,250
So let's think about--

822
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,090
[LAUGHTER]

823
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,010
PROFESSOR: Let's
step back for second

824
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,750
and let's think, OK, it's
a very good question.

825
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,110
So let's think about
what it should be.

826
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,710
OK.

827
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,210
For the moment, put an
arbitrary power there.

828
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:46,800
OK.

829
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,780
And let's think about
what it should be.

830
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,430
Thank you so much
for this question.

831
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,300
I owe you, like, a plate
of cheese or something.

832
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,990
That's high praise, guys.

833
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,500
France, cheese.

834
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,000
So should it be linear or
should it be quadratic?

835
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,080
What is that supposed
to represent?

836
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,125
What is T, the capital
T, supposed to represent?

837
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,874
AUDIENCE: The probability
of transmission.

838
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,340
PROFESSOR: The probability
of transmission, exactly.

839
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,230
The wave function.

840
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,390
Is the wave function,
the value of the wave

841
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,660
function at some point,
is that a probability?

842
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,330
It's a--

843
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,824
AUDIENCE: Probability
of density.

844
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,320
No, it's the square root.

845
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,760
PROFESSOR: Is it a
probability of density?

846
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,860
It is a probability amplitude.

847
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,560
It is a thing whose norm
squared is a probability.

848
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,000
So we want something that's
quadratic in the wave function,

849
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,190
right.

850
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,860
Meanwhile, some time before,
we wanted a definition

851
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,320
of how much stuff is moving
past a point in the given

852
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,010
moment in time.

853
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,250
What's the probability
density moving past a point

854
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,000
at a given moment in time.

855
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,680
And that's where we got the
current j from the first place.

856
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,637
j was the probability
density moving past a point

857
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:50,720
at a given moment in time.

858
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,240

859
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,160
So notice that j is quadratic
in the wave function,

860
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,110
so it's how much stuff is moving
past any particular direction--

861
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,837
we chose it to be the incident
to the reflected bit--

862
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:04,670
at a moment in time.

863
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,444
So it's a probability density--
it's actually a current--

864
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:10,110
and it's quadratic
in the wave function.

865
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,290
So it has the right units
and the right structure

866
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,600
to be a probability.

867
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,324
If we squared that, we would be
in trouble, because it wouldn't

868
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:18,490
be a probability, it would
be a probability squared.

869
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,370
And in particular, it
wouldn't normalize correctly.

870
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,320
So that typo was
actually a bad typo.

871
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,190
So what happened, now
thinking back to-- you

872
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,087
have a video someday,
so you can scroll back.

873
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,420
What happened was I didn't
put the squared on the first,

874
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,030
I put the squared on the
second, and then someone said

875
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,905
squared on the first?

876
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:34,420
Like, yes.

877
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,969
But the correct answer is
no squared on the second.

878
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,010
So there are no squareds.

879
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,390
Thank you for the question.

880
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,240
Very good question.

881
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,615
In particular,
the thing that was

882
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,156
so awesome about
that question was it

883
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,329
was motivated by physics.

884
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,870
It was like, look, why is this
thing squared the right thing?

885
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,460
That's two factors
of the wave function,

886
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,460
it's already quadratic.

887
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,470
It should be like a probability.

888
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,710
Why are you squaring it?

889
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,971
Very good question.

890
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:54,470
Yeah.

891
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,540
AUDIENCE: So in the
transmission probability,

892
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,460
why do we know it's 0 if
the energy is less than v0?

893
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,890
I mean, is there any rule?

894
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,909
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, good.

895
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,950
We'll come back to that
question in a little bit,

896
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,380
but let me just quickly
say that we calculated it,

897
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,300
and we see explicitly
that it's 0.

898
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,466
Now you might say well,
look, the true wave function

899
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,626
has a little bit of a tail.

900
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,250
So there's some
[INAUDIBLE] probability

901
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,140
you'll find it here if
you do a measurement.

902
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,098
But the question we want
to ask in transmission

903
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,590
is, if you send it in
from far away over here,

904
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,350
how likely are you to catch
it far away over here?

905
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,965
And the answer is, you are not.

906
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,570
That make sense?

907
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,910
OK, good.

908
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,270
OK, so so much for that one.

909
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,500
Now, here's a fun
fact, I'm not going

910
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,874
to go through this
in any detail.

911
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,996
We could have done exactly
the same calculation-- OK,

912
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:42,620
we could have done
the same calculation

913
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,310
sending something
in from the right.

914
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:50,370
And sending something in from
the right, in on the right,

915
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,549
corresponds to d not
equal to 0 and nothing

916
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,340
coming in from the
left, that's a equals 0.

917
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,089
So we could have done
the case a equals 0,

918
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,140
which is in from the right.

919
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,100

920
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,850
And if you do that
calculus, what you find

921
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:12,270
is c is equal to k1 minus
k2 upon k1 plus k2 d.

922
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:23,160
And b is equal to 2k1
upon k1 plus k2 d.

923
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,320
And this says that
plugging these guys in,

924
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,800
the reflection and the
transmission are the same.

925
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,531
In particular, physically,
what does that mean?

926
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,280
That means the reflection
and transmission

927
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,200
are the same uphill as downhill.

928
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,970
Downhill is uphill,
they're the same both ways.

929
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,390
But that's truly weird, right?

930
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:52,060
What's the probability to
transmit quantum mechanically

931
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,562
if you have just a
little bit of energy

932
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:55,770
and you send the particle in?

933
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,395
How likely are you
to go off the cliff.

934
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,130

935
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,890
If we have energy ever so
slightly greater the potential,

936
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,610
and the transmission
amplitude is the same downhill

937
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,820
as it was uphill, how likely are
you to fall off the potential?

938
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,236
AUDIENCE: Always.

939
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:14,420
PROFESSOR: Never.

940
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,440
Because if energy is just
slightly greater than v0,

941
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,240
then the transmission
probability is very, very low.

942
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,020

943
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,340
The transmission to
go from here to here

944
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,450
is extremely low
if the energy is

945
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,900
close to the height
of the barrier.

946
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,994
So had I only been on a
quantum mechanical hill,

947
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:38,160
I would have been just fine.

948
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,780

949
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,290
This is a really
striking result,

950
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,030
but this thing, the
fact that you're

951
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,730
unlikely to scatter uphill,
that's maybe not so shocking.

952
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,350
But you're really unlikely
to scatter downhill,

953
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,265
that is surprising.

954
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:54,290

955
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,300
So I'll leave it to you
to check that, in fact,

956
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,860
the transmission, when we
do it in from the right,

957
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,050
the transmission and reflection
probabilities are the same.

958
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,160
Recalling that transmission
means going this way,

959
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,140
reflection means bouncing
back to the right.

960
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,650
Cool?

961
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,013
Yeah.

962
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:12,888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

963
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:16,668

964
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:20,320
PROFESSOR: Uh, because, again.

965
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,720
Jeez, today is just a disaster.

966
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,390
Because there's a typo.

967
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,008
This should be times a.

968
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:25,917
God.

969
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,250
And the reason you know it
should be times a, first off,

970
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,990
is that these should have
the appropriate dimensions.

971
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,975
So there should be an
appropriate power of a.

972
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,350
And the second thing is that
if you double this stuff in,

973
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,870
you'd better double
this stuff out.

974
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,800
So if you double a,
you'd better double c.

975
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,380
So you know there had better
be a factor of a here.

976
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,730
And that's just a typo again.

977
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,124
I'm sorry, today is a bad
day at the chalkboard.

978
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:47,290
Thank you for that question.

979
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:47,925
Yeah.

980
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:49,790
AUDIENCE: Is there
a physical reason

981
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,657
for why r and t are the same
and so different from what

982
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:58,240
you would classically expect,
or is that just the way the math

983
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,700
works?

984
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,533
PROFESSOR: There is.

985
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,060
I want you to ponder that,
and either at the end of today

986
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,792
or at the beginning
of tomorrow, we'll

987
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,250
talk about that
more in detail when

988
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,962
we've done a little
more technology.

989
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:08,420
It's a good question
and you should

990
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,760
have that tingling
sensation in your belly

991
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,740
that something is
confusing and surprising

992
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,920
and requires more explanation,
and we'll get there.

993
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,800
But I want you to just think
about it in the background

994
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,299
first.

995
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:18,114
Yeah.

996
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:21,502
AUDIENCE: Is there any
physical experiment

997
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:23,922
where r and t don't sum up to 1?

998
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,858
PROFESSOR: Mm mm.

999
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:26,830
Nope.

1000
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,220
So the question is, is
there any experiment

1001
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,120
in which r and t
don't sum up to 1?

1002
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,715
And there are two
ways to answer that.

1003
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:37,590
The first way to answer
that is, it turns out

1004
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,369
that r and t adding up to 1
follows from the definitions.

1005
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:43,410
So one of the things you'll
do on the problem set

1006
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:48,105
is you'll show that using these
definitions of the transmission

1007
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:50,810
and reflection of
probabilities, they necessarily

1008
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,300
add up to 1, strictly.

1009
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,970
They have to.

1010
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,120
It follows from the
Schrodinger equation.

1011
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,639
The second answer
is, let's think

1012
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,930
about what it would mean if
r and t didn't add up to 1.

1013
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,230
If r and t didn't
add up to 1, then

1014
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,646
that would say,
look, if you throw

1015
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:05,270
a particle at a barrier, at
some feature in a potential,

1016
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,282
some wall, then the
probability that it

1017
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:09,240
goes this way at the end
versus the probability

1018
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,540
that it goes that way at the
end if you wait long enough

1019
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,370
is not 1.

1020
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,630
So what could have happened?

1021
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,213
What could have
gotten stuck in there?

1022
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:19,970
But that doesn't even
conserve momentum,

1023
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,100
not even approximately.

1024
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,933
And we know that the
expectation of momentum

1025
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:28,780
is time independent
for a free particle.

1026
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,780
In between while it's
actually in the potential,

1027
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,860
it's not actually
time independent,

1028
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,401
there's a potential,
there's a force.

1029
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:36,540
AUDIENCE: I mean, if it's whole
particles, can't some of them

1030
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,396
get annihilated or something?

1031
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:40,035
PROFESSOR: Ah, well OK.

1032
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:41,910
So if you're talking
about multiple particles

1033
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,743
and interactions amongst
multiple particles,

1034
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,920
then it's a slightly more
complicated question.

1035
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,340
The answer there
is still yes, it

1036
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,530
has to be that the
total probability in

1037
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,990
is the total probability out.

1038
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,210
But we're only going to talk
about single particles here.

1039
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,070
But it's always true
that for-- we're

1040
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,570
going to take this
as an assumption,

1041
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,617
that things don't
just disappear,

1042
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:04,825
that the number of particles
or the total probability

1043
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:06,110
is conserved.

1044
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,165
There's a third way to
say this, this really

1045
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:09,540
isn't independent
from the first.

1046
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,475
Remember that these were
defined in terms of the current?

1047
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:15,490
The current satisfies--
the current concept

1048
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,790
of probability conservation
equation dt of rho

1049
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:25,740
is equal to the gradient minus
the gradient of the current.

1050
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,820
So the probability
is always conserved,

1051
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,290
the integral of probability
density is always conserved,

1052
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,240
it's time independent.

1053
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,680
AUDIENCE: So it's
by [INAUDIBLE].

1054
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's by construction.

1055
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,150
Exactly.

1056
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,280

1057
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,059
Yeah?

1058
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,350
AUDIENCE: Looking at your
expression for the transition

1059
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:45,770
probability, I'm having trouble
seeing how that works out to 0

1060
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,790
when e is less than v0?

1061
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,460
PROFESSOR: Oh, this
expression is only

1062
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,394
defined when e is equal to v0.

1063
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:54,310
Because we derived this--
excellent question--

1064
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,594
we derived this assuming that
we had an energy greater than v0

1065
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,510
and then that the wave
function had this form.

1066
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,093
You cannot use this form of the
wave function if the energy is

1067
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:02,730
less than v0.

1068
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,050
If the energy is
less than v0, you've

1069
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,700
got use that form of
the wave function.

1070
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,660
And in this form of
the wave function,

1071
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,924
we derived that the
transition amplitude is 0,

1072
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:11,340
because the current on the
right, the transmitted current,

1073
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,510
is 0.

1074
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,354
So this calculation
is appropriate

1075
00:45:14,354 --> 00:45:16,770
when e is less than v0 and
this calculation is appropriate

1076
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,082
when e is greater than v0.

1077
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,290
So you're absolutely correct.

1078
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,160
You can't use this
one e is less than v0,

1079
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,030
it gives you not
the same answer.

1080
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,240
In fact, it gives
you a complex--

1081
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,260
it's kind of confusing.

1082
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,900
The factors cancel.

1083
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,799
So it's not really a
probability at all,

1084
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:32,090
and indeed, this is just not
the right quantity to use.

1085
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,173
AUDIENCE: All right, cool.

1086
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:33,930
PROFESSOR: Cool?

1087
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,429
All right.

1088
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:38,000

1089
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,700
So there are a
bunch of nice things

1090
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,950
I want to deduce from
what we've done so far.

1091
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,660
So the first is,
look, I pointed out

1092
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,050
that this can be
derived just explicitly

1093
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,580
and it gives the same
results as before.

1094
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,860
That's not an accident.

1095
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,490
If you take this
system and you just

1096
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,800
reverse the roles of k1
and k2, what happens?

1097
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,040
Well that's just
replaces e by e minus v0,

1098
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,280
we can do that by doing this,
replacing e by e minus v0

1099
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,660
and e minus v0 by e, it
swaps the role of a and d,

1100
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,710
and it gives you exactly
the same things back.

1101
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,459
So if you're careful
about that, you never

1102
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:15,810
have to do this calculation.

1103
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,420
You can just do the
appropriate transformation

1104
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,086
on that calculation and it gives
you the exactly the same thing.

1105
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:23,210

1106
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,324
It's the same algebraic steps.

1107
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,740
But the other thing
that's nice is

1108
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,960
that you can actually do
the same thing from here.

1109
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,632
So as long as you
set the d equals 0--

1110
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:33,590
so there's another term
here that we neglected,

1111
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,600
the plus delta x,
we got rid of it.

1112
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,900
But you can analytically
continue this calculation

1113
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,500
by noting that look,
if we just set alpha,

1114
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,890
we want minus alpha
equals ik2, then

1115
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,170
the algebra is all
going to be the same.

1116
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,530
We just have ik2
instead of minus alpha.

1117
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:56,450
So we can just replace
alpha with minus ik2

1118
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,510
everywhere in our
expressions, being

1119
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,620
careful about
exactly how we do so,

1120
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,980
being careful to
take care of factors

1121
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,600
of i and such correctly.

1122
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,150
And you derive the same
results for both cases, which

1123
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,419
is a nice check on
the calculation.

1124
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:11,960
So often, when you get a little
bit of experience with these,

1125
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,410
you don't actually have
to do the calculation.

1126
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,910
Again, you can
just take what you

1127
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,010
know from a previous
calculation and write down

1128
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,360
the correct answer.

1129
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,756
So it's a fun
thing to play with,

1130
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:20,880
exactly how do you do that.

1131
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,950
So I invite you to think
through that process

1132
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,064
while you're doing
your problem set.

1133
00:47:26,064 --> 00:47:27,730
Another thing is the
reflection downhill

1134
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,560
thing which is
pretty surprising.

1135
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,040
But here's the thing that
I really want to emphasize.

1136
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,870
What this calculation
shows you is not so much

1137
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:42,730
that-- it's not just that
transmission downhill

1138
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,390
is highly unlikely
when the energy is

1139
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,720
very close to the height
of the potential barrier.

1140
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,890
That's true, but it's not
the most interesting thing

1141
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,010
about this calculation.

1142
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,950
The most interesting thing about
this calculation, to my mind,

1143
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,500
is the fact that from
the detailed shape

1144
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:03,710
of the transmission as
a function of energy,

1145
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,600
we can deduce what
the potential is.

1146
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,100
Think about what that tells you.

1147
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,634
If you do an experiment,
you have a barrier,

1148
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:13,550
and you want to know the
shape of the barrier.

1149
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,630
Is it straight,
is it wiggly, does

1150
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,800
it have some complicated shape.

1151
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,890
How do you measure that?

1152
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,420
Well, you might measure
it by just looking.

1153
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,044
But imagine you can't,
for some reason.

1154
00:48:22,044 --> 00:48:24,270
For whatever, it's in a box
or you can't look at it.

1155
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,010
Maybe it's just
preposterously small.

1156
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,356
How can you deduce what
the shape of that hill is?

1157
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:30,730
Well, one way to
do it is to send

1158
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,460
in particles as a function of
energy, more and more energy,

1159
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,360
and measure the probability
that they transmit.

1160
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,010
OK.

1161
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,370
Now if you do so and you get
this graph as a function of e,

1162
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,700
what do you deduce?

1163
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,480
You deduce that the barrier
that you're scattering off of

1164
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,960
is a square step
with this height v0.

1165
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,070

1166
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,150
Are we cool with that?

1167
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,290
So apparently, just
look at the transmission

1168
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,070
amplitudes, the
transition probabilities,

1169
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,270
you can deduce at
least something

1170
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,254
of the form of the potential.

1171
00:49:02,254 --> 00:49:03,170
Which is kind of cool.

1172
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,545
If you didn't know
the potential,

1173
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:07,000
you could figure
out what it was.

1174
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,696
And this turns out to be a
very general statement that you

1175
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,696
can deduce an enormous
amount, and as we'll see,

1176
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:13,310
you can, in fact,
deduce basically

1177
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,230
everything you want
of the potential

1178
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,840
from knowing about the
transmission probabilities

1179
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,240
as well as the phase shift,
the transmission amplitudes.

1180
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,334
So this is the basic
goal of scattering.

1181
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:25,750
And so the way I
want you to think

1182
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,390
about it is imagine, for
example, that someone

1183
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,660
hands you an object.

1184
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,890
A box.

1185
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,610
And the box has an in port
and it has an out port.

1186
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,380
And they allow you
to send in particles

1187
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,535
as a function of energy
and measure transmission

1188
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:41,035
and reflection, you can measure
transmission and reflection.

1189
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:44,350
Just like I'm measuring
transmission off of your faces

1190
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,760
right now, from the
light from above.

1191
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,725
So suppose that you do so, put
it on your test stand and you

1192
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:52,600
measure transmission.

1193
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,750
You measure transmission
as a function of energy,

1194
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,800
and you observe the following.

1195
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,500
The transmission as
a function of energy

1196
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,770
is small up until some point,
and then at some point,

1197
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,260
which may be the minimum energy
you can meaningfully probe,

1198
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,620
you get something like this.

1199
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:19,380

1200
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,987
So here's the transmission
as a function of energy.

1201
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:22,820
So what can you say?

1202
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,534

1203
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:26,950
If this is all the
information you

1204
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,470
have about what's going
on inside the box,

1205
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,620
what can you deduce about
the thing inside the box?

1206
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,340

1207
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,900
One thing you can
deduce is that it

1208
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:42,130
looks kind of like a potential
with height around v0.

1209
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,500
It looks kind of like a
potential step with some height

1210
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,380
v0.

1211
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,460
This is asymptoting to 1.

1212
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,070
However, it's not, because it
has these oscillations in it.

1213
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,720
So there's more to the potential
than just a barrier of height

1214
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,885
v0.

1215
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:59,260
What I want to show you is
that you can deduce everything

1216
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,790
about that potential, and
that's the point of scattering.

1217
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,010
So let's do it.

1218
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:11,600
So the goal here, again, to say
it differently, is what's v0?

1219
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,866
What is v of x?

1220
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,740
Not just the height,
but the total potential.

1221
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,152

1222
00:51:18,152 --> 00:51:19,860
So another way to say
this, let me set up

1223
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,457
a precise version
of this question.

1224
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:24,040
I want to be able
to do the following.

1225
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,623
I want to take a system that has
a potential which is constant

1226
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:31,670
up to some point
which I'll call 0,

1227
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,660
and then again from some
point, which I'll call L,

1228
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,860
is constant again.

1229
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,940
And inside, I don't know
what the potential is.

1230
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,569

1231
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,360
So in here, there's
some unknown potential,

1232
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,480
v of x, which is
some crazy thing.

1233
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,660
It could be doing anything.

1234
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:54,230
It could be some crazy-- it
could have horns and whatever.

1235
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,287
It could be awful.

1236
00:51:57,287 --> 00:51:59,620
But the potential is constant
if you go far enough away,

1237
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,953
and the potential is constant
if you go far enough away.

1238
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:05,980
A good example of this
is a hydrogen atom.

1239
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,380
It's neutral but there's
a clearly and complicated

1240
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,550
potential inside because
the proton and the electron

1241
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,350
are moving around in there in
some quantum state, anyway,

1242
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,366
and if you send something
at it, far away, it's

1243
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,240
as if it's not there.

1244
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,950
But close by, you know there
are strong electrostatic forces.

1245
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,325
And so the question is what
you learn about those forces,

1246
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:23,260
what can you learn
about the potential

1247
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,120
by throwing things in from
far away, from either side.

1248
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,660
Now one thing we know already
is that out here, the wave

1249
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,170
function always-- because it's
a constant potential-- always

1250
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:36,750
takes the form e to the ikx
plus b e to the minus ikx.

1251
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,740
And out here it takes the
form c e to the ikx plus d

1252
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,550
e to the minus ikx.

1253
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,350
And again, this
corresponds to moving in.

1254
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:51,010
d is in from the right.

1255
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,330
c is out to the right.

1256
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,580
b is out to the left.

1257
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,735
And a is in from the left.

1258
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:02,360
So again, there are
basically four kind

1259
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,430
of scattering
experiments we can do.

1260
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,250
We can send things in
from the right, which

1261
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,680
corresponds to setting a to 0.

1262
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,430
We can send things in
from the left, which

1263
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,460
corresponds to
setting t equal to 0.

1264
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,405
And all the information
about what happens in v

1265
00:53:13,405 --> 00:53:15,740
is going to be encoded
in what's coming out,

1266
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,787
the b and c coefficients.

1267
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:19,370
And the way to make
that sharp is just

1268
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,817
to notice that the transmission
probability, if we compute

1269
00:53:22,817 --> 00:53:25,150
for this system, assuming
it's forming the wave function

1270
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,450
asymptotically away from the
potential, the transmission

1271
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,800
amplitude is just
c over a squared

1272
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,500
when you're sending
in from the left.

1273
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:41,260
And the reflection is equal
to b over a norm squared.

1274
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,987
This squared is a squared.

1275
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,070
[INAUDIBLE] function over
amplitude squared, good.

1276
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:49,540

1277
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,280
To learn about the transmission
and reflection coefficients,

1278
00:53:52,280 --> 00:54:01,840
it's enough-- suffices--
to compute, to know b and c

1279
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,905
as a function of a and d.

1280
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:07,280
All of the scattering
information

1281
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,230
is in those coefficients
b and c for a and d.

1282
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,380
And here I'm assuming that I'm
sending in a monochromatic wave

1283
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,040
with a single, well
defined energy.

1284
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,446
I'm sending in a beam of
particles with energy e.

1285
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:20,070
I don't know where
they are, but I sure

1286
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,360
know what their momentum is.

1287
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,350
So some well defined beam
of particles with energy e.

1288
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,490
And these
probabilities are going

1289
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,910
to contain all the data I want.

1290
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,560
So this is the basic
project of scattering.

1291
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,250
Questions?

1292
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,040
AUDIENCE: So basically,
it only depends

1293
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,414
on the transmission-- it
only depends on the edges?

1294
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:44,830
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

1295
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,913
The question is, does the
transmission depend only

1296
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:48,430
on what you do with the edges.

1297
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:49,930
And here's the important thing.

1298
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,640
The transmission
depends crucially

1299
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,785
on what happens in here.

1300
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,910
For example, if this is an
infinitely high barrier,

1301
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,940
nothing's going across.

1302
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,360
So this transmission
depends on what's in here.

1303
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,870
But the point is we can deduce
just by looking far away,

1304
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,890
we can deduce the
transmission probability

1305
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,740
and amplitude just by
measuring b and c far away,

1306
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,390
b and c far away.

1307
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,180
OK.

1308
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,530
So the transmission
amplitude is something

1309
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,920
you measure when very far away.

1310
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,045
You measure-- if I throw
something in from very far

1311
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:19,740
out here to the left, how likely
is it to get out here very

1312
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,120
far to the right?

1313
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,194
And in order to answer
that, if someone

1314
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,610
hands you the
answer to that, they

1315
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,930
must have solved
for what's inside.

1316
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:27,810
That the point.

1317
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,810
So knowing the answer
to that question

1318
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:34,282
encodes information about
what happened in between.

1319
00:55:34,282 --> 00:55:37,560
AUDIENCE: So I guess
initially, your potential's

1320
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,511
going to-- so say it's
stuff you did earlier.

1321
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,946
The potential drops down to
the [INAUDIBLE] in the box.

1322
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:43,920
Is that going to be problematic?

1323
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,520
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
for simplicity, I'm

1324
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,370
going to assume that the
potential always goes to 0 when

1325
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,953
we're far away, because that's
going to be useful for modeling

1326
00:55:49,953 --> 00:55:55,070
things like hydrogen
and, exactly.

1327
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,050
Carbon, we're going
to do diamond later

1328
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,540
in the semester,
that'll be useful.

1329
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,020
But we could repeat
this analysis

1330
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,020
by adding an extra change
in the asymptotic potential,

1331
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,870
it doesn't really change
anything important.

1332
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:06,828
Yeah.

1333
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:09,702
AUDIENCE: It looks like even
for just the simple step up

1334
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,256
[INAUDIBLE] you can't tell
from just the probabilities why

1335
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:14,360
the step is going
up or going down.

1336
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,760
PROFESSOR: Ah, excellent.

1337
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,680
Excellent, excellent.

1338
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,430
So good, thank you for that
question, that's really great.

1339
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:22,700
So already, it seems
like we can't uniquely

1340
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,749
identify the potential from
the transmission probability

1341
00:56:27,749 --> 00:56:30,040
if the transmission probability
is the same for step up

1342
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,120
or step down.

1343
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,376
So what's missing?

1344
00:56:34,376 --> 00:56:37,777
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
energy [INAUDIBLE]

1345
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:40,110
PROFESSOR: But we're working
with an energy [INAUDIBLE].

1346
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,670
So the energy is just
a global constant.

1347
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,330
We'll see what's
missing, and what's

1348
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,130
missing is something
called the phase shift.

1349
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,390
So very good question, yes.

1350
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:56,078
AUDIENCE: It looks like when we
did the example for the step,

1351
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:58,863
that t equals [INAUDIBLE]
over a squared.

1352
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:01,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is,
because it's the ratio.

1353
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,680
That's why I wrote
t is c over here.

1354
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,150
So t is the ratio of j over ji.

1355
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:14,220
And in fact, jt here is
equal to c squared times--

1356
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,834
so this is the
probability density,

1357
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,250
so it's the probability density
times the velocity, what's

1358
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,480
the effect of velocity here?

1359
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:26,560
H bar k 2 over m, whereas
j incident is equal

1360
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,450
to a squared--
probability density

1361
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,480
times the momentum there,
the velocity there--

1362
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,720
which is h bar k1 upon m.

1363
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,600
So here the ratio of j
transmitted to j incident

1364
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,265
is norm c squared k2
over norm a squared k1.

1365
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:44,806
AUDIENCE: So because
it's not level--

1366
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:46,340
PROFESSOR: Exactly, it's
because it's not level.

1367
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,800
So here, they
happen to be level,

1368
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,390
so they're only
[INAUDIBLE] factor, cancel,

1369
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,900
and the only thing that
survives is the amplitude.

1370
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,947
Good question.

1371
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:55,438
Yeah.

1372
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:59,414
AUDIENCE: For the
lead box example,

1373
00:57:59,414 --> 00:58:02,010
is it sufficient
just to know what's

1374
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:05,047
reflected back to
solve the situation?

1375
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,880
PROFESSOR: So for
precisely for this reason,

1376
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,961
it's not sufficient to know t.

1377
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:10,460
It's not sufficient
to know t and r.

1378
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,431
But, of course, once
you know r, you know t,

1379
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,430
so you're exactly right.

1380
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,665
Once you know the
reflection probability,

1381
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,336
you know the
transmission probability,

1382
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:17,960
but there's one more
bit of information

1383
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,584
which we're going to
also need in order

1384
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:23,565
to specify the potential, which
is going to be the phase shift.

1385
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,940
But you're right, you don't
need to independently compute

1386
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,290
r and t, you can
just compute one.

1387
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,456
AUDIENCE: You need sensors
on both sides of the box,

1388
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:30,421
to answer my question.

1389
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:32,722
PROFESSOR: You
don't need sensors

1390
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,180
on both sides of the box, but
you need to do more than just

1391
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,020
do the counting problem.

1392
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,710
We'll see that.

1393
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,040
OK.

1394
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,390
So let's work out a simple
example, the simplest

1395
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,520
example of a barrier
of this kind.

1396
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,810
We want constant potential,
and then ending at 0,

1397
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:57,160
and we want a constant again
from L going off to infinity.

1398
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,930
So what's the easiest
possible thing we could do?

1399
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:01,200
Step, step.

1400
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,050
We're just doing what
we've done before twice.

1401
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,520
So this is an example of
this kind of potential.

1402
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,390
It's sort of ridiculously
simple, but let's work it out.

1403
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,035
So we want scattering,
let's start out,

1404
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:13,090
we could do either
scattering from the left

1405
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,220
or scattering from the right.

1406
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,600
Let's start out scattering
from the left, so d equals 0,

1407
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,550
and let's study this problem.

1408
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:25,291
So what we know--
and let's also note

1409
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,540
that we have a choice to make.

1410
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,555
We could either study
energy below the height

1411
00:59:28,555 --> 00:59:30,180
of the potential or
we can study energy

1412
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,749
above the height
of the potential.

1413
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:34,290
And so for simplicity,
I'm also going

1414
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:36,123
to start with energy
greater than the height

1415
00:59:36,123 --> 00:59:40,511
of the potential, v0, and
then we'll do e less than v0

1416
00:59:40,511 --> 00:59:41,010
afterwards.

1417
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,926
It'll be an easy extension
of what we've done.

1418
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:46,760

1419
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,217
OK, so this will be our
first case to study.

1420
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:52,300
So we know the form of the
wave function out here,

1421
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,815
it's a e to the ikx,
b to the minus ikx.

1422
00:59:54,815 --> 00:59:56,440
We know that for the
potential out here

1423
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,499
it's c e to the ikx and
d e to the minus ikx.

1424
00:59:58,499 --> 01:00:00,165
The only thing we
don't know is the form

1425
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:02,117
of the potential in here.

1426
01:00:02,117 --> 01:00:03,700
And in here it's
actually very simple.

1427
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,430
It's got to be something
of the form-- I

1428
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,920
think I called it
f and g, I did.

1429
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,460
f e to the ik prime
x-- I'm calling this k,

1430
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,396
so I'll just call this
k prime x-- plus g

1431
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:19,090
e to the minus ik prime x.

1432
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,690
And the reason I
chose k prime is

1433
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:23,350
because we're working
with energy greater

1434
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,850
than the potential, so this is
a classically allowed region.

1435
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,980
It's an oscillatory domain
but with a different k prime.

1436
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,850
So here, k squared, h bar
squared over 2m is equal to e,

1437
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:39,800
and h bar squared k
prime squared over 2m

1438
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,510
is equal to e minus
v0, which is positive

1439
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,270
when e is greater than v0.

1440
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,500
This analysis will not obtain
when e is less than v0,

1441
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,200
we'll have to treat
it separately.

1442
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,407
So now what do we do?

1443
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:52,740
We do the same thing we did
before, we just do it twice.

1444
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,080
We'll do the matching
conditions here,

1445
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,410
the matching conditions here.

1446
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,520
That's going to give us 1,
2, 3, 4 matching conditions.

1447
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,922
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 unknown coefficients,

1448
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:03,380
so we'll have two
independent ones.

1449
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,170
That's great.

1450
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:07,240
We set d equal to 0
to specify that it's

1451
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,949
coming in from the left and
not from the right, that's 5.

1452
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,740
And then we have
normalization, which is 6,

1453
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,850
so this should uniquely
specify our wave function.

1454
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,110
Yeah.

1455
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,295
Once we've fixed e, we
have enough conditions.

1456
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:21,170
So I'm not going to go
through the derivation

1457
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,430
because it's just an extension
of what we did for the first.

1458
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,888
It's just a whole
bunch of algebra.

1459
01:01:24,888 --> 01:01:26,200
And let me just emphasize this.

1460
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,650
The algebra is not interesting.

1461
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,465
It's just algebra.

1462
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:29,840
You have to be
able to do it, you

1463
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,760
have to develop some
familiarity with it,

1464
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,380
and it's easy to
get good at this.

1465
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,370
You just practice.

1466
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,910
It's just algebra.

1467
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,260
But once you get the idea,
don't ever do it again.

1468
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,270
Once you get
reasonably quick at it,

1469
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,750
learn to use Mathematica, Maple,
whatever package you want,

1470
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,520
and use computer algebra
to check your analysis.

1471
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,540
And use your physics
to check the answer

1472
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,570
you get from Mathematica or
Maple or whatever you use.

1473
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,110
Always check against
physical reasonability,

1474
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,230
but use Mathematica.

1475
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,097
So posted on the website
are Mathematica files

1476
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:01,305
that walk through the
computation of the transmission

1477
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,900
and reflection amplitudes
and probabilities

1478
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,690
for this potential, and I
think maybe another one,

1479
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,370
I don't remember exactly.

1480
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,546
But I encourage you strongly
to use computer algebra tools,

1481
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:12,920
because it's just
a waste of time

1482
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,003
to spend three hours doing
an algebra calculation.

1483
01:02:15,003 --> 01:02:18,380
In particular, on your
problem set this week,

1484
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,620
you will do a scattering problem
similar to the bound state

1485
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,120
probably you did last week, the
quantum glue problem-- which

1486
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,935
you may be doing tonight,
the one due tomorrow.

1487
01:02:27,935 --> 01:02:29,310
Which is two delta
function wells

1488
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,210
and find the bound
states, so that

1489
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,650
involves a fair
amount of algebra.

1490
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,185
The scattering
problem will involve

1491
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,351
a similar amount of algebra.

1492
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:37,490
Do not do it.

1493
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,966
Use Mathematica or
computer algebra

1494
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:40,090
just to simplify your life.

1495
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:46,430

1496
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,405
So if we go through and
compute the-- so what

1497
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:51,530
are we going to do, we're
going to use the matching

1498
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,330
conditions here to determine
f and g in terms of a and b,

1499
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,150
then we'll use the
matching conditions here

1500
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:02,480
to determine c-- d is 0--
c in terms of f and g.

1501
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,970
So that's going to give us an
effective constraint relating

1502
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,600
a and b, leaving us with an
overall unknown coefficient

1503
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,470
a, which we'll use
for normalization.

1504
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,010
The upshot of all of
which is the answers

1505
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,300
are that, I'm not even going
to write down-- they're

1506
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,790
in the notes.

1507
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,330
Should I write this down?

1508
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:18,940
I will skip.

1509
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,160
So the upshot is that the
transmission amplitude,

1510
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,840
as a function of k and k prime--
the transmission probability, I

1511
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,437
should say, is 1
over-- actually,

1512
01:03:26,437 --> 01:03:28,020
I'm going to need
the whole amplitude.

1513
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,520
Shoot.

1514
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:36,740

1515
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,210
The transmission
probability is equal to--

1516
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:51,190
and this is a horribly
long expression--

1517
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:57,200
the transmission probability,
which is c over a norm squared,

1518
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:08,110
is equal to 4 k squared k prime
squared cosine squared of k

1519
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:19,890
prime l plus k squared plus
k prime squared sine squared

1520
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:30,945
of k prime l under 4k
squared k prime squared.

1521
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:31,445
Seriously.

1522
01:04:31,445 --> 01:04:34,450

1523
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,970
So we can simplify this out,
so you can do some algebra.

1524
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:38,595
This is just what
you get when you just

1525
01:04:38,595 --> 01:04:40,950
naively do the algebra.

1526
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,960
I want to do two things.

1527
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,189
First off, this is horrible.

1528
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:45,230
There's a cosine squared,
there's a sine squared,

1529
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:47,730
surely we can all be
friends and put it together.

1530
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:48,915
So let's use some trig.

1531
01:04:48,915 --> 01:04:51,040
But the second thing, and
the more important thing,

1532
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,150
is I want to put this
in dimensionless form.

1533
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:53,870
This is horrible.

1534
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:58,040
Here we have ks and we have ls,
and these all have dimensions,

1535
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,939
and they're inside the sines
and the cosines it's kl.

1536
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,230
That's good, because this
has units of one over length,

1537
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,990
this has units of length,
so that's dimensions.

1538
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,890
Let's put everything
in dimensionless form.

1539
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:09,410
And in particular, what are
the parameters of my system?

1540
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,660
The parameters of my system
are, well, there's a mass,

1541
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,400
there's an h bar, there's a
v0, and then there's an energy,

1542
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,590
and there's a length l.

1543
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,500
So it's easy to make a
dimensionless parameter out

1544
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,341
of these guys, and a
ratio of energies--

1545
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,590
a dimensionless ratio of
energies-- out of these guys.

1546
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,750
So I'm going to do that, and
the parameters I'm going to use

1547
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:32,540
are coming from here.

1548
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:40,550

1549
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:46,630
I'm going to define the
parameters g0 squared, which

1550
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,450
is a dimensionless measure of
the depth of the potential.

1551
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,890
We've actually run
into this guy before.

1552
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:57,600
2m l squared v0
over h bar squared.

1553
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,237
So this is h bar squared, 1 over
l squared is k squared over 2m,

1554
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:02,070
so that's an energy.

1555
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:04,250
So this is a ratio of the
height of the potential

1556
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,030
to the characteristic energy
corresponding to length scale

1557
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,295
l.

1558
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:10,420
So the width, there's an
energy corresponding to it

1559
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,061
because you take a momentum
which has 1 over that width.

1560
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:15,560
You can build an energy out of
that h bar k squared over 2m.

1561
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,935
And we have an energy which
is the height of the barrier,

1562
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:19,600
we take the ratio of those.

1563
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,450
So that's a dimensionless
quantity, g0.

1564
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,860
And the other dimensionless
quantity I want to consider

1565
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,050
is a ratio of the
energy, e, to v0,

1566
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,315
which is what showed up
before in our energy plot.

1567
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:32,850

1568
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:35,820
Or in our transmission
plot over there, e over v0.

1569
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,230
So when we take this and we
do a little bit of algebra

1570
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,740
to simplify our life, again, use
Mathematica, it's your friend.

1571
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,660
The result is much
more palatable.

1572
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:50,990
It's t-- again, for the
energy greater than v0--

1573
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,490
is equal to, still long.

1574
01:06:54,490 --> 01:07:03,230
But 1 plus 1 over 4 epsilon,
epsilon minus 1 sine

1575
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:10,960
squared of g0 square
root of epsilon minus 1.

1576
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,400

1577
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,645
And upstairs is a one.

1578
01:07:16,645 --> 01:07:21,900

1579
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,270
So remember this is only
valid for e greater than v0,

1580
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,630
or equivalently,
epsilon greater than 1.

1581
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,640
And I guess we can
put an equal in.

1582
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,590

1583
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,267
So when you get an
expression like this,

1584
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:36,600
this is as easy as you're
going to make this expression.

1585
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,974
It's not going to
get any easier.

1586
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:41,430
It's 1 over a sine
times a function plus 1.

1587
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,542
There's really no great
way to simplify this.

1588
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,750
So what you need when you
get an expression like this

1589
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,549
is try to figure out
what it's telling you.

1590
01:07:47,549 --> 01:07:49,090
The useful thing to
do is to plot it.

1591
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,682
So let's just look
at this function

1592
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:51,890
and see what it's telling us.

1593
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:55,560
Let's plot this t as
a function of epsilon

1594
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,750
and for some fixed g0.

1595
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,460

1596
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,960
Keep in mind that this only
makes sense for e greater

1597
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,564
than v0 or for epsilon
greater than 1, so here's 1.

1598
01:08:04,564 --> 01:08:05,980
And we're going
to remain agnostic

1599
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,780
as to what happens below 1.

1600
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,310
And just for normalization,
we know that the transmission

1601
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,976
probability can never
be greater than 1,

1602
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:15,180
so it's got to be
between 1 and 0.

1603
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:19,260
So here's 0 and 0.

1604
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,207
We're remaining agnostic
about this for the moment.

1605
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:24,540
So let's start thinking about
what this plot looks like.

1606
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,620
First off, what does
it look like at 1?

1607
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,020
So when epsilon
goes to 1, this is

1608
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,380
going to 0, that's bad
because it's in a denominator.

1609
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,130
But upstairs, this
is going to 0,

1610
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:37,149
and sine squared of something
when it's becoming small

1611
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:39,210
goes like-- well, sine
goes like that thing.

1612
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,840
So sine squared goes like
this quantity squared.

1613
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,100
So sine squared goes
like g0 squared,

1614
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,260
this goes like 1
over-- this is going

1615
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,270
like g0 squared epsilon
minus 1 square root quantity

1616
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,040
squared, which is
epsilon minus 1.

1617
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,290
So this is going to 0 and
this, the denominator,

1618
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:56,290
is going to 0 exactly
in the same way.

1619
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:58,359
Epsilon minus 1 from
here, epsilon minus 1

1620
01:08:58,359 --> 01:08:59,240
downstairs from here.

1621
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,770
So the epsilon minus
ones precisely cancel.

1622
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,810
From the sine squared
we get a g0 squared,

1623
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:06,300
and from here we
get a 4 epsilon.

1624
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,840
So we get 1 plus g0
squared over 4 epsilon.

1625
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,010
But 4 epsilon, what
was epsilon here?

1626
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:14,672
1.

1627
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:16,130
We're looking at
epsilon goes to 1,

1628
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,109
so this is just
g0 squared over 4.

1629
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:22,779
So the height, the value of t--
so we're not looking in here.

1630
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:26,399
But at energy is equal to
v0 or epsilon is equal to 1,

1631
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,220
we know that the transmission
amplitude is not 0,

1632
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,091
but it's also strictly
smaller than 1.

1633
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:33,590
Which is good,
because if it were 6,

1634
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,630
you'd be really worried.

1635
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,600
So g0 squared, if g0 squared
is 0, what do we get?

1636
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,100
1.

1637
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,189
Fantastic, there's no barrier.

1638
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:43,700
We just keep right on going
through, perfect transmission.

1639
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,510
If g0 is not zero, however,
the transmission is suppressed.

1640
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,660
Like 1 over g0 squared.

1641
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,240

1642
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,320
What does this actually
look like with some value.

1643
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,400
And what is this value,
it's just 1 over 1

1644
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,620
plus 1/4 g0 squared.

1645
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,060
Cool?

1646
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,824
OK.

1647
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:07,240
And now what
happens, for example,

1648
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,780
for a very large epsilon?

1649
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,430
Well, when epsilon is gigantic,
sine squared of this-- well,

1650
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:15,930
sine squared is
oscillating rapidly,

1651
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:16,850
so that's kind of worrying.

1652
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,390
If this is very,
very large, this

1653
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,960
is a rapidly
oscillating function.

1654
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,796
However, it's being divided
by roughly epsilon squared.

1655
01:10:22,796 --> 01:10:25,170
So something that goes between
0 and 1 divided by epsilon

1656
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:28,090
squared, as epsilon
gets large, becomes 0.

1657
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,560
And so we get 1 over
1 plus 0, we get 1.

1658
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,780
So for very large values
it's asymptoting to 1.

1659
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:36,760
So naively, it's going to
do something like this.

1660
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,425
However, there's
this sine squared.

1661
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:39,800
And in fact, this
is exactly what

1662
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,900
it would do if we just had
the 1 over epsilon times

1663
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,577
some constant.

1664
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:46,160
But in fact, we have
the sine squared,

1665
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,868
and the sine squared
is making it wiggle.

1666
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,875
And the frequency
of the wiggle is g0,

1667
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,500
except that it's not
linear in epsilon,

1668
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,342
it's linear in square
root of epsilon.

1669
01:10:55,342 --> 01:10:57,550
So as epsilon gets larger,
the square root of epsilon

1670
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:00,740
is getting larger
less than linearly.

1671
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,650
So what that's telling you is
if you looked at root epsilon,

1672
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,290
you would see it
with even period.

1673
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,840
But we don't have
root epsilon, we're

1674
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,464
plugging this as a
function of epsilon.

1675
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,910
So it's not even period,
it's getting wider and wider.

1676
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,780
Meanwhile, there's a
nice fact about this.

1677
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:17,984
For special values of epsilon,
what happens to sine squared?

1678
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:18,650
It goes to zero.

1679
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,108
And what happens
when this is zero?

1680
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:22,280

1681
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,700
Yeah, t is 1.

1682
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,190
So every time sine is 0,
i.e., for sufficient values

1683
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:31,282
when root epsilon is a multiple
of pi determined by g0,

1684
01:11:31,282 --> 01:11:32,240
transmission goes to 1.

1685
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,790
It becomes perfect.

1686
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,880
So in fact, instead
of doing-- wow.

1687
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,210

1688
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:45,780
Instead of doing this, what
it does is it does this.

1689
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:50,000

1690
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,760
So let's check that
I'm not lying to you.

1691
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,510
So let me draw it
slightly different.

1692
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,659
To check, so it's going to
0, and the period of the 0

1693
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:00,200
is getting further
and further along.

1694
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,570
That's because this is
square root, not squared.

1695
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,600
So epsilon has to get much
larger to hit the next period.

1696
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,760
That's why it's getting
larger and larger spacing.

1697
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,840
However, the amplitude
goes down from 1,

1698
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,200
that's when this gets largest.

1699
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,610
Well, at large values of
epsilon, this is suppressed.

1700
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:18,040
As epsilon goes
larger and larger,

1701
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,440
this deviation become
smaller and smaller.

1702
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,250
So that's what this
plot is telling us.

1703
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,400
This plot is telling
us a bunch of things.

1704
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:31,440
First off, we see that
at large energies,

1705
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,462
we transmit perfectly.

1706
01:12:32,462 --> 01:12:33,170
That makes sense.

1707
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,590
This was a finitely
high barrier.

1708
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,191
Large energies, we
don't even notice it.

1709
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,210
It tells you at low
energies-- well,

1710
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,570
we don't know yet what
happens at very low energies.

1711
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,805
But at reasonably low energies,
the transmission is suppressed.

1712
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:46,430
And if you sort of
squint, this roughly

1713
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,530
does what we'd expect
from the step barrier.

1714
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,460
However, something
really special

1715
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,472
is happening at special
values of epsilon.

1716
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:53,930
We're getting
perfect transmission.

1717
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,710

1718
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:01,390
We get perfect transmission of
these points, t is equal to 1.

1719
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,550
Perfect.

1720
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:03,050
Star.

1721
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,890

1722
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:06,860
Happy with a big nose.

1723
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,840
I don't know.

1724
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,560
Perfect transmission
at all these points.

1725
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,042
So this leaves us with
a question of why.

1726
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,620
Why the perfect
transmission, what's

1727
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,320
the mechanism making
transmission perfect.

1728
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,630
But it also does something
really lovely for us.

1729
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:26,280
Suppose you see a spectrum, you
see a transmission amplitude

1730
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,630
or transmission probability
that looks like this.

1731
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,900
You may get crappy data.

1732
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,289
You may see that
it's smudged out

1733
01:13:31,289 --> 01:13:32,830
and you see all
sorts of messy stuff.

1734
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:35,210
But if you know that
there's perfect transmission

1735
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,430
at some particular
epsilon 1, there's

1736
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,180
more perfect transmission at
another epsilon 2, more perfect

1737
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,900
transmission at
epsilon 3, and they

1738
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,750
scale, they fit to
this prediction.

1739
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,487
What do you know?

1740
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,070
That you've got a
finite high barrier,

1741
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:52,047
and it's probably pretty well
approximated by a square step.

1742
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:54,630
So in your problem set, you're
going to get experimental data,

1743
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,882
and you're going to have to
match to the experimental data.

1744
01:13:57,882 --> 01:13:59,590
You're going to have
to predict something

1745
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:02,320
about the potential that created
a particular transmission

1746
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,730
probability distribution.

1747
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,449
And knowing where
these resonances are,

1748
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:07,240
where these points of
perfect transmission,

1749
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,490
is going to be very
useful for you.

1750
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:08,989
Yeah.

1751
01:14:08,989 --> 01:14:10,866
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there
another potential

1752
01:14:10,866 --> 01:14:13,920
that will also
create periodic 1s?

1753
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,370
PROFESSOR: A very good question.

1754
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,520
So I'm going to turn
that around to you.

1755
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,790
Can you orchestrate a potential
that gives you the same thing?

1756
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,092

1757
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,800
That's an interesting
empirical question.

1758
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,350
So, on the problem set, you'll
study a double well potential.

1759
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,121
So the question
was, how do I know

1760
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:34,370
isn't another potential that
gives me the same answer?

1761
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,200
At this point, we don't know.

1762
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,300
Maybe there is
another potential.

1763
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,850
In fact, you can do
all sorts of things

1764
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,100
to make a potential that's
very arbitrarily close that

1765
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,000
gives you an arbitrarily
similar profile.

1766
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,296
So if they're
significantly different,

1767
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:46,615
how different do they look?

1768
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,490
So then the students
say, well, I don't know.

1769
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:49,650
What about a double
well potential?

1770
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,774
So, in fact, we'll be doing
a double well potential

1771
01:14:51,774 --> 01:14:54,600
on the problem set.

1772
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,370
A good question.

1773
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,640
And we certainly
haven't proven anything

1774
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,900
like this is the
only potentially

1775
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,420
that gives you this
transmission amplitude.

1776
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,794
What we can say is if you get
transmission amplitude that

1777
01:15:01,794 --> 01:15:04,550
looks like this, it's
probably pretty reasonable

1778
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,796
to say it's probably
well modeled.

1779
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:09,920
We seem to be reproducing
the data reasonably well.

1780
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,600
So it's not a proof of
anything, but it's a nice model.

1781
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,200
And we're physicists,
we build models.

1782
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,990
We don't tell you
what's true, we

1783
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:20,594
tell you what are good models.

1784
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:22,010
If a theorist ever
walks up on you

1785
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:27,410
and he says, here's the
truth, punch him in the gut.

1786
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:28,960
That's not how it works.

1787
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,852
Experimentalists,
on the other hand.

1788
01:15:30,852 --> 01:15:32,310
We'll just punch
them too, I guess.

1789
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:36,264
[LAUGHTER]

1790
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:38,330
PROFESSOR: We build models.

1791
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:42,580
OK, so this leaves us
with an obvious question,

1792
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,210
which we've answer
in the case of energy

1793
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,030
grade in the potential.

1794
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:53,571
What about the case of the
energy less than the potential.

1795
01:15:53,571 --> 01:15:55,570
So we haven't filled out
that part of the graph.

1796
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:57,153
Let's fill out that
part of the graph.

1797
01:15:57,153 --> 01:16:00,020
What happens if the energy
is less than the potential?

1798
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:03,190
And for this, I'm going to
use the trick that I mentioned

1799
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:04,696
earlier that, look,
if the energy is

1800
01:16:04,696 --> 01:16:06,570
less than the potential,
that just means that

1801
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:09,574
in the intervening
regime, in here,

1802
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:10,990
instead of being
oscillatory, it's

1803
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:13,550
going to be exponentially
growing [INAUDIBLE]

1804
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,940
because we're in a
classically disallowed region.

1805
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:17,410
So if the energy
is less than v0,

1806
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:21,200
here we have instead of
ikx, we have minus alpha x.

1807
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,750
And instead of minus ikx
we have plus alpha x.

1808
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,010
So if you go through
that whole analysis

1809
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:32,400
and plug in those values for
the k prime, the answer you get

1810
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,570
is really quite nice.

1811
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:38,174
We find that t for energy
less than v0 is equal to--

1812
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:40,340
and it's just a direct
analytic continuation of what

1813
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:51,571
you get here-- 1 plus 1 over
4 epsilon 1 minus epsilon.

1814
01:16:51,571 --> 01:16:52,820
So epsilon is less than 1 now.

1815
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:56,516

1816
01:16:56,516 --> 01:17:08,050
1 sinh squared of g0 1
minus epsilon under 1.

1817
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:09,965
OK, so now this lets
us complete the plot.

1818
01:17:09,965 --> 01:17:13,812

1819
01:17:13,812 --> 01:17:15,770
And you can check, it's
pretty straightforward,

1820
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,230
that because sinh, again,
goes like its argument

1821
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:20,020
at very small values
of its argument,

1822
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:23,000
we get g0 squared
1 minus epsilon.

1823
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,130
Sorry, this should be
square root 1 minus epsilon.

1824
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:27,680
Really?

1825
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,896
Is that a typo?

1826
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:29,770
Oh no, it's in there.

1827
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,510
OK, good.

1828
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,580
So again, we get g0
squared 1 minus epsilon,

1829
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,282
the 1 minus epsilon cancels,
and we get 1 over 4 g0 squared.

1830
01:17:38,282 --> 01:17:39,990
Which is good, because
if they disagreed,

1831
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,050
we'd be in real trouble.

1832
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,740
So they agree, but the sinh
squared is just a strictly--

1833
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,920
or that function is just
a strictly decreasing

1834
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,670
function as we approach
epsilon goes to 0.

1835
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,320
It goes mostly to 0.

1836
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,300
So this is what we see.

1837
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,890
We see an exponential
region and then

1838
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,820
we see oscillations
with residences

1839
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:01,780
where the period is
getting wider and wider.

1840
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,379
But this should trouble
you a little bit.

1841
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,420
Here, what are we saying?

1842
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,570
We're saying look,
if we have a barrier,

1843
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,010
and we send in a
particle with energy way

1844
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:18,012
below the barrier,
that's kind of troubling.

1845
01:18:18,012 --> 01:18:20,470
If we send in a particle with
energy way below the barrier,

1846
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,860
there's some probability
that it gets out.

1847
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:23,610
It goes across.

1848
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:27,980

1849
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:35,340
So for e less than v0,
classically no transmission,

1850
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,800
we get transmission.

1851
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:44,447
Now, do we get resonances
when e is less than v0?

1852
01:18:44,447 --> 01:18:45,780
No, that's an interesting thing.

1853
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,900
We'll talk about resonances
and where they come from,

1854
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,360
and we'll talk about the more
generalized notion of a nest

1855
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,150
matrix in the next lecture.

1856
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,860
But for now I just want to say
a couple of things about it.

1857
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:00,700
So I want to ask-- so
this is called tunneling,

1858
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:06,240
this transmission across
a disallowed barrier,

1859
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:14,841
a classically
disallowed barrier--

1860
01:19:14,841 --> 01:19:16,840
so this transmission
across a disallowed barrier

1861
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,910
is called tunneling.

1862
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:26,000
And just a quick thing to notice
is that if we hold e fixed

1863
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,496
and we vary l, we vary
the width of the barrier,

1864
01:19:29,496 --> 01:19:31,120
how does the tunneling
amplitude depend

1865
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,120
on the width of the barrier?

1866
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,140
At fixed energy, if we vary the
width of the barrier-- which

1867
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,527
is only contained
in g0-- how does

1868
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,860
the transmission amplitude vary?

1869
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,450
And we find that for large
l-- for l much greater than 1

1870
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,950
for a typical scale
in the problem--

1871
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:54,180
the tunneling amplitude goes
like e to the minus 2 alpha l

1872
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:58,049
where alpha just depends on
the energy in the potential.

1873
01:19:58,049 --> 01:20:00,340
So what we see is that the
probability of transmitting,

1874
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:03,170
of tunneling through
a wall, depends

1875
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,610
on the width of that wall.

1876
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,830
And it depends on
it exponentially.

1877
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,300
The wider the wall, the
exponentially less likely you

1878
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,420
are to tunnel across it.

1879
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,280
And this fits the
simulation we ran

1880
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,530
where we saw that tunnelling
through a very thin wall

1881
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,590
was actually quite efficient.

1882
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:20,260
And we also saw that
tunnelling across a wall

1883
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,260
can have resonant peaks.

1884
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,584
At special values, it
transmits perfectly.

1885
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:24,875
We saw that in the simulations.

1886
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:29,396

1887
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:32,020
So at this point I can't resist
telling you a very short story.

1888
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:35,620
I have a very good friend
who is not a physicist,

1889
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,880
but who is a professor at MIT.

1890
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,810
So a smart person,
and very smart.

1891
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,890
She's one of the
smartest people I know.

1892
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:47,170
She broke her ankle.

1893
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:49,880
She's always losing stuff,
she's constantly losing stuff.

1894
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,840
And she broke her ankle, and she
was going to the rehab place,

1895
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,635
and she parked her car right
in front of the rehab place.

1896
01:20:58,635 --> 01:21:00,010
She parked her
car right in front

1897
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:01,250
because she's got
the broken ankle

1898
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,130
and she doesn't want to have to
walk a long way to get the car,

1899
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:04,370
she parked right in front.

1900
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:06,660
She went in, she did
her two hours of rehab,

1901
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,740
and she came outside,
and her car was gone.

1902
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,575
And she's always
misplacing her car,

1903
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,950
she's always
misplacing her keys,

1904
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,241
she's always losing everything.

1905
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:19,750
But this time, this time
she knew where it was.

1906
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,380
And it wasn't there.

1907
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,777
So first she thought, oh
crap, my car's been stolen.

1908
01:21:24,777 --> 01:21:26,360
How annoying, I've
got a broken ankle.

1909
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,262
But she looks
around, and there's

1910
01:21:28,262 --> 01:21:30,220
her car on the other side
of the street pointed

1911
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,700
the opposite direction.

1912
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,340
And she's like, finally.

1913
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:36,910
Finally.

1914
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,235
She was explaining this to
me and a friend of mine who

1915
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:41,760
is also a physicist,
she said finally, I

1916
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,710
knew I had incontrovertible
proof that quantum

1917
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,990
effects happen to
macroscopic objects.

1918
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,300
My car tunnelled
across the street.

1919
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,890
[LAUGHTER]

1920
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,390
PROFESSOR: At this
point, of course,

1921
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,490
my friend and I are
just dying of laughter.

1922
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:57,560
But she said my car
tunnelled across the street.

1923
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,290
But here's the problem,
I couldn't tell anyone.

1924
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,340
Because if I told anyone, they
would know that I was crazy.

1925
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:07,000
Clearly I'm crazy, because I
lose my stuff all the time,

1926
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,870
but surely it's just
gotten misplaced.

1927
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:10,820
So I went home, and
I got home and I

1928
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,400
was sitting down to dinner with
my partner and our daughter

1929
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,120
and I was burning up
inside because I wanted

1930
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,020
to tell them this
crazy thing happened.

1931
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:20,817
I know quantum
mechanics, it happens.

1932
01:22:20,817 --> 01:22:22,650
I couldn't tell them
anything, so I was just

1933
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,530
fidgeting and dying.

1934
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:26,380
And finally my
daughter said, mom,

1935
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,190
didn't you notice that we moved
the car across the street?

1936
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:31,520
[LAUGHTER]

1937
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,660
PROFESSOR: See you next time.

1938
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,835
