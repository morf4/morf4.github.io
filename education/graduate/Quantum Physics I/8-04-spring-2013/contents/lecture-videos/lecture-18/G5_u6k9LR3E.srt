00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,377

10
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,210
PROFESSOR: OK, so let
me just quickly remind

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,120
you of what we've done
what we did last time.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,931
So unfortunately, today is going
to be a little bit of what I

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,430
wanted to do this time and a
little bit of what I would have

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,050
wanted to have been done
in recitation yesterday,

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,980
because all recitations
were cancelled.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,900
So today is going to include
a few steps along the way

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,010
that I skipped over last time.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,157
OK, so to review
from last time, we

19
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,490
talked about central potentials.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,110
The energy operator had a radial
derivative term, an angular

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,822
momentum term, and
a potential term.

22
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,280
So this would be true regardless
of whether we were central

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,880
or not.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,004
But if we have a central
potential, where this only

25
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:59,890
depends on the magnitude
of the radius vector,

26
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,970
then we can use
separation of variables,

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,560
and write an energy eigenstate
as a radial part-- which

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,300
we will sneakily pull out a
factor of 1 over the radius--

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,350
as we saw last time, that
was particularly convenient.

30
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,870
It took care of this r and made
everything nice and simple.

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,102
So a radial part times
a spherical harmonic.

32
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:20,810
The reason we use a
spherical harmonic is

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,940
that neither of these two
terms depend on the angular

34
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,610
coordinates.

35
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,240
The angular momentum, we know
what its eigenfunctions are,

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,656
so if we use a
spherical harmonic,

37
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:32,060
this angular momentum
becomes just a constant.

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,320
And having separated
in this form,

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,110
and pulling out that
sneaky factor of 1 over r,

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,100
the energy eigenvalue equation
reduces to a simple 1-D

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,560
effective energy
eigenvalue equation

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,060
with a simple dr squared,
and an effective potential,

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,490
where the effective potential is
the original central potential

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,320
plus an angular
momentum term, often

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,870
referred to the angular
momentum barrier-- which

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,400
is proportional
to-- as Matt says,

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,800
as Professor Evans
says, in 804, one

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,680
is forced to say h bar
squared upon 2m repeatedly.

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,180
And he pointed out that it would
be much more efficient if I

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,620
would just come up with a
simple variable for saying it

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,750
or sound.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,188
So I will attempt to
henceforth call it pfft.

53
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:20,650
[LAUGHTER]

54
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,000
So the effective
potential is pfft,

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,410
l, l plus 1 upon r squared
plus the central part

56
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,870
of the potential-- props
to Professor Evans.

57
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,160
And this is true in general
for central potential.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,330
The last thing we notice of
this is that since the energy

59
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,920
eigenvalue equation has been
reduced to this form, which

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,120
depends on l, but is
independent of m-- m

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,020
appears nowhere here--
the energy can't possibly

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:52,360
depend on m, although
it can depend on l.

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,500
It's just e of l.

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,420
And thus, for every
different value of m,

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,410
I will get the same energy--
fixed l, different m.

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,390
And there are how many
values of m for a fixed l?

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,110
2l plus 1.

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:15,110
So the degeneracy
of El is 2l plus 1.

69
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,610
Right?

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,290
That's general for
any central potential.

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,790
It only requires
spherical symmetry.

72
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,990

73
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,020
So then we say the example of
the cooling potential, where

74
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,920
the potential is minus
E squared upon r.

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,670

76
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,465
And we solved-- or I quickly
reviewed the solution

77
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:39,710
of the energy
eigenvalue equation.

78
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,870
I'll write it that
way-- where r of what

79
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,440
I will call-- in place of
E I, will simply write n.

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Rnl is equal to e to
the minus r over 2

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:09,300
r naught n times r over r
naught to the l plus 1 times

82
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:18,200
some simple function v sub
n of l of r over r naught,

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,920
with the energy nlm
being equal to E naught--

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,730
or I should say e Rydberg in
our notation of last time--

85
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,750
upon n squared
minus bound state.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,100
So let's talk
about this quickly.

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,560
This term-- the fact that it
goes exponentially-- falls

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,850
exponentially at
large distances--

89
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,359
came from the asymptotic
analysis at r goes to infinity.

90
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,150
And this is just saying
it's a bound state.

91
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,410
The probability density
falls off exponentially

92
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,050
as we get to large radius.

93
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,470
This term came from
the asymptotic analysis

94
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,180
near r goes to zero.

95
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,620
And near r goes to
zero, the only term

96
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,850
that matters is in the
effective-- this is one upon r.

97
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,920
This is 1 over r squared, so
this gets large more rapidly.

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,110
This term is important,
and that l, l plus 1

99
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,660
gave us r to the l plus 1.

100
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,080
We work in dimensionless
variables, rho.

101
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,270
And here, I replace rho
with r over r naught,

102
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,061
where r naught was the
characteristic scale

103
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,640
we computed last time.

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,650
And finally, this
function V sub nl

105
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,710
satisfied-- it again satisfied
the energy eigenvalue equation,

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,500
but having pulled
out these factors

107
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,130
such that asymptotically,
its regular.

108
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,820
So this function
must be regular,

109
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,890
smooth-- no
divergences, no poles--

110
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,610
as r goes to infinity and to 0.

111
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,250
OK.

112
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,380
And then we solved this
by series expansion.

113
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,340
And from termination of
the series expansion,

114
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,310
we got that the energy--
we got a relationship

115
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,100
between the energy
and l and n, and

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,240
in particular the
relationship-- this

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,000
came from termination
of the series, just

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,985
like it did for the
harmonic oscillator.

119
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,870

120
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,300
And the termination
series gave us

121
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,721
that the energy was equal
to minus a constant over n

122
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:13,220
squared.

123
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,610

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,580
With one additional
condition, which

125
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,800
is that n had to
be greater than l.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,849
n had to be an integer
greater than l.

127
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,140
And l, of course, has to be
greater than or equal to 0.

128
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,580

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,250
So let me just
quickly tell you how

130
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,840
this arises, because this is an
important fact about hydrogen

131
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,860
which I want you to understand.

132
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,430
So the way that arises is we
got the energy from a series

133
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,096
expansion for this remaining
function of rv and l of r.

134
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,900
And that series
expansion started out

135
00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:00,020
by saying let v be of the
form sum over j of a sub j, r

136
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,235
over r naught, the dimensionless
variable rho, to the j,

137
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,660
to the j-th power, so
it's a power series.

138
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,890
And when we plug this
whole form, together

139
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,660
with this series expansion,
into that differential equation,

140
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,460
we get-- just like we did before
for a harmonic oscillator--

141
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,870
we get a set of
relations between

142
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,120
the various coefficients
in that series.

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
And we solve that by
saying a sub j plus 1--

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,530
by deriving a recursion
relation-- is equal to a sub

145
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,350
j times 2, square
root of epsilon times

146
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:53,930
j plus l plus 1 minus 1 upon
j plus 1, j plus 2l plus 2.

147
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,210

148
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,860
OK, fine.

149
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,151
We get this recursion relation.

150
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,410
It looks absolutely
awful, but it tells you

151
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,010
that if you know a0, say, is
a constant which is not 0--

152
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,635
if it's zero, then
they're all 0-- then

153
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:11,170
this function is identically
0, because a j plus 1

154
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,940
is a j times some constant.

155
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,321
So this had better
not vanish-- a sub 0.

156
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,820
So the first term,
the constant term

157
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,774
doesn't vanish, which is good.

158
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,690
It tells us V doesn't
vanish, so we've already

159
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,439
learned something.

160
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,250
If V doesn't vanish
identically at the origin,

161
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,085
then we can determine a1 from
a0 by multiplying by this.

162
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:32,030
j is 0 in this, and
l is whatever number

163
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,919
we fix from ylm.

164
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,460
And so on.

165
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,799
We can deduce all
the higher a sub l's.

166
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a series expansion.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,260
This is the recursion
relation for it.

168
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,920
However, note the following
thing-- as j gets large,

169
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,690
so we go to higher and
higher orders in the series,

170
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,100
then j is much larger than
whatever fixed number l is,

171
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,410
and much larger than
whatever fixed number 2 is.

172
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,610
So this asymptotes to aj times
roughly 2 epsilon j upon j

173
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,410
plus 1 j.

174
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,915
At very large j, this just
goes to 2 epsilon over j.

175
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,540
Now, let's think
about what that means.

176
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,530
If I have that aj plus
1 is roughly equal

177
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,720
to aj times root epsilon
times 2 over j plus 1,

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,900
I guess, then this tells me
that every time I increase j,

179
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,120
I get a factor of j plus 1
and another factor of 2 root

180
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,810
epsilon.

181
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,450
This tells me that a sub j
is equal to a sub 0 times

182
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:40,174
2 root epsilon to the
j over j factorial.

183
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:41,840
But those are the
expansion coefficients

184
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,230
of an exponential-- quantity
to the n over n factorial.

185
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,080
But that's bad, because
if this series is

186
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,220
the exponential series with
argument 2 root epsilon,

187
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:03,840
then this series becomes E to
the 2 root epsilon r over r0.

188
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,090
But that's bad, because that
would exactly swamp this term.

189
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,810
That would defeat the
asymptotic analysis

190
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,810
we did at the beginning.

191
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,980
If this term, V, is
growing so large twice

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,310
as rapidly as this
is going to 0,

193
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,470
then the net is
diverging at infinity.

194
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,820
That's bad.

195
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,790
So in order for this--
for the series expansion--

196
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,330
to describe a good function that
really does vanish at infinity,

197
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,150
we need that this
doesn't happen.

198
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,750
So it must be true
that j doesn't

199
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,350
get large enough that
the exponential in V

200
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,800
overwhelms the
decaying exponential

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
from the asymptotic analysis.

202
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,450
Everyone cool with that?

203
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,044
So it has to terminate.

204
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,460
But if it terminates-- let's
look at the coefficient here.

205
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,210
If it terminates, this says that
2 root epsilon times j plus--

206
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,810
and if it terminates, that says
that there's some j maximum.

207
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,437

208
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:57,770
Well, let me write it over here.

209
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,270
If it terminates,
that means there's

210
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,850
some value j such
that aj plus 1 is 0.

211
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,830
But if aj plus 1 is zero,
how can that possibly be?

212
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,180
It must be that for
that maximum value of j,

213
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,850
the numerator
vanishes-- specifically

214
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,900
for that maximum value of j.

215
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,700
Yeah?

216
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,690
Well, what's the condition
for that numerator

217
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,390
to vanish for a
specific value of j?

218
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll j sub m, or j
max, the maximum value,

219
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,470
such that a sub j
max plus 1 vanishes.

220
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,080
So j plus l plus 1
must be equal to 1.

221
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,300
Or said differently,
epsilon-- which

222
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,060
is the energy in units
of e0, must be equal to 1

223
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:45,080
over 4 g max plus l plus
1, quantity squared.

224
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,510
Cool?

225
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,070
So that means that our
solutions, or states psi,

226
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,700
are now labeled
by three integers.

227
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,440
they're labeled by l And by
m from spherical harmonics,

228
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
but they're also labeled
by the value j max.

229
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,710

230
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,452
And j max can be any number
from 0 to infinity, right?

231
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:08,910
Strictly, it
shouldn't be infinite,

232
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,930
but any finite number, any
countable, any integer--

233
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,570
because eventually the
series terminates at j max.

234
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,230
So it's labeled by
these three numbers,

235
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:28,680
and the energy of lmj max
is equal to e0 minus over 4.

236
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,520
And this e0 over 4 we already
saw was e Rydberg, 13.6 dv,

237
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,680
times what value?

238
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,722
Well, here's the energy in
units of e0-- jm plus l plus 1,

239
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:40,430
quantity squared.

240
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,890

241
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,650
Where L is greater
than or equal to 0,

242
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,090
j sub m is greater than
or equal to 0, and 1 is 1.

243
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,990
But this is sort of cumbersome.

244
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,620
We can just as well
call this quantity n,

245
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,370
where n is greater
than l as an integer.

246
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,210
It can't be equal
to l, but it could

247
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,900
be 1 greater than l,
or any greater integer.

248
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,930
Is that cool?

249
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,420
So instead of labeling
it by jm, the point

250
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,370
at which the series terminates,
we'll label it by n,

251
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,230
and you can deduce what jm is
by subtracting I plus 1 from n.

252
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,200
That tells you where
the series terminates.

253
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,510
Notice that this tells
you something nice.

254
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,640
This power series for V,
if n is equal to l plus 1,

255
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,850
has how many terms in it?

256
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,389

257
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,430
So say it out loud, just
think about it a second.

258
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,834
If n is equal to l
plus 1, how many terms

259
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,750
are there, that are
non-vanishing in the power

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,250
series?

261
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,874

262
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,540
I won't call on you,
but raise your hand

263
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
when you have an answer.

264
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:50,690

265
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,480
What's the value of j max
if n is equal to l plus 1?

266
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,060
So what term is the first
one to vanish in the series?

267
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,254

268
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,920
OK, so how many terms
are non-vanishing?

269
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,540

270
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,560
Yeah, just the one--
just the first term.

271
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,320
So when l is as large
as it can possibly

272
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,480
be-- when l is equal to n minus
1, V is a constant function.

273
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,451
It's just constant.

274
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:27,340
When l is one less, when l is
n minus 1, or n is l plus 2,

275
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,559
then V has two terms in it--
a constant, and a linear.

276
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,475
So the greater the
difference between l and n,

277
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:37,140
the more terms there
are in the series.

278
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,380
OK?

279
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,360
So anyway, this leads to
this form of the energy.

280
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,720
But as is usually the case, this
sort of a brute force analysis

281
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,570
doesn't give us a
whole lot of insight

282
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,770
into why we get the
qualitative features we do.

283
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,990
In particular, the
qualitative feature

284
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,870
that stands out most obviously
to me-- I don't know about you

285
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,830
guys-- is the fact that
the degeneracy is now much,

286
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,980
much larger.

287
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,200
In particular, we know
from basic principles

288
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,220
of a central potential--
as we just reviewed--

289
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,980
that anytime a potential
is symmetrically invariant,

290
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,930
is spherically
symmetric-- any time

291
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,390
the potential is spherically
symmetric, rotationally

292
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,720
invariant-- then there
must be degeneracy

293
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,400
of 2l plus 1 for every energy
eigenstate-- there must be.

294
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,420
The l could be zero, but if
there's any angular momentum,

295
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,750
then that degeneracy
must be 2l plus 1.

296
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,315
But this is much
more degenerate.

297
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:37,200

298
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,480
And in fact, how
degenerate is it?

299
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,430
Well, for any given
En, the degeneracy

300
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,210
is equal to-- well, what are
the possible values of l?

301
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,390
So we have some state for
every different value of l.

302
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,580
l could be equal to 0, and it
can go up to n minus 1, right?

303
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:07,290
Because, again,
n is some integer

304
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,640
which could vanish, l plus 1.

305
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,360
So as small as this can be is 0.

306
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,520
So n can be l plus 1,
or anything greater.

307
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,300
I.e.: l can go up to n minus
1, but it can't be any greater.

308
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,806
Then for every value of
l, there is a state n--

309
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:27,222
there's a value of n which
could be minus l all the way up

310
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:28,202
to l in integer steps.

311
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:29,410
So how many states are there?

312
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,830
Well there's one state for
every value of n, l, and m.

313
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,490
So it's this sum.

314
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,140
The sum on m for minus
l to l is 2l plus 1.

315
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,240
So this is the sum n minus
1, l equals 0, of 2l plus 1.

316
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,600
And this is equal to,
kind of beautifully, n

317
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,150
squared-- just
arithmetic series.

318
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,440
So we have this huge
degeneracy, which

319
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,340
is much larger than 2l plus 1.

320
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,910
It's the sum over 2l plus
1 from l to 0 to n minus 1.

321
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,615
Where is this
degeneracy coming from?

322
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,115
Why?

323
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:11,220

324
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,160
So quantum mechanically,
we know the following--

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
we've learned the
following-- and I

326
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,940
hope it's under your
fingernails at this point--

327
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,890
that when you see
a degeneracy, you

328
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,619
should expect that degeneracy
to follow from some symmetry.

329
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,980
There's some symmetry
of the system that

330
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,160
is leading to a degeneracy
by virtue of the fact

331
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,285
that the generators of that
symmetry-- for example,

332
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,970
for rotation it's
angular momentum--

333
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,380
commute with the energy.

334
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,860
And when you have an operator
that commutes with the energy

335
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,350
operator, as we've
seen, you can generally

336
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,300
construct new states given
a single energy eigenstate

337
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,230
by acting suitably
with that operator.

338
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,814
So we should expect there
to be some new symmetry.

339
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,480
But it's very hard
to see what symmetry.

340
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,287
I mean, this is hydrogen.

341
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,370
This is central potential.

342
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,100
It's just some stupid
central potential.

343
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,300
What's so special about
the hydrogen system as

344
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,650
opposed to, for example,
the harmonic oscillator?

345
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,830
Which hopefully you will see
in recitation at some point.

346
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,360
The harmonic oscillator
in three dimensions

347
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,590
has degeneracy 2l plus 1.

348
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,650
It's a central potential.

349
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,320
It has to have degeneracy 2l
plus 1-- but not n squared.

350
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,370
Where did that come from?

351
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,290
What's so special about
the Kepler problem?

352
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,870
So there must be some
symmetry, but it's not obvious

353
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,640
what it is.

354
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,415
But now let's use a note
from classical mechanics.

355
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,540
Noether's Theorem tells us
when we have a symmetry,

356
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,617
we have a conserved quantity.

357
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,700
We also saw this in the
quantum mechanical version

358
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,022
for expectation values.

359
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,230
We have a conserved quantity.

360
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,632

361
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,840
And in quantum mechanics,
having a conserved quantity

362
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
means that the energy
commutes with some quantity.

363
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,734

364
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,400
Because that controls
the time evolution

365
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,441
of the expectation value.

366
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,739

367
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,280
So there must be
some quantity, which

368
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,440
I've written by a question mark,
that commutes with the energy

369
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,290
operator, specifically
in the case

370
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,150
of the harmonic oscillator.

371
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,529
So what is that quantity?

372
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:07,570
So actually, this quantity
in classical mechanics

373
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,816
was studied, because
the same thing

374
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,940
is true in the Kepler case.

375
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,230
In the Kepler case,
the orbits close,

376
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,006
and they have simple
ellipses, and they

377
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:16,380
have all sorts of
nice properties

378
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,869
that beg for an explanation
in terms of symmetry.

379
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,160
And it was pointed out by a
number of people-- Laplace,

380
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,560
Runge, Lenz, various
people-- and this is often

381
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,020
called the Runge-Lenz
vector, but I

382
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,630
think you can blame it
on any number of people--

383
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,740
that there's a vector that
in classical mechanics,

384
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,830
for the Kepler problem--
or for the Coulomb problem,

385
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,200
is conserved.

386
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,100
And that quantity is p cross
l-- momentum cross angular

387
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,825
momentum-- minus m
e squared-- and let

388
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:49,290
me write m sub electrons--
it's the mass rather

389
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,800
than the quantum number little
m-- e squared, r vector.

390
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,940
So it turns out this quantity
is classically conserved,

391
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,280
and if you make a quantum
operator out of it,

392
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,260
then e with A is equal to 0.

393
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,582
Add hat.

394
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,700
This was enormously non-obvious.

395
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,800
If it's obvious to
you, you're a freak.

396
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,230
It's really, really not obvious.

397
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,310
You can go through and
do the calculation.

398
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,320
And when I say really not
obvious, I mean-- well,

399
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,310
I'll show you what I
mean in just a second.

400
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,825
So you can go through and do
the calculation classically.

401
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,880
Is this quantity conserved
in the Kepler problem

402
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,520
using Newton's law?

403
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,110
And the answer is yes.

404
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,920
It's amazing.

405
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,210
Quantum mechanically, you
can do the same thing.

406
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,120
But I'm going to warn you for
anyone who has the chutzpah

407
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,620
to try-- because I
encourage you to,

408
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,280
but it takes a
little bit of brawn--

409
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,570
think about this
operator for second.

410
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,019
Does this classical quantity
have an obvious interpretation

411
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:42,935
as a quantum operator?

412
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:45,980

413
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,230
No, because l is r cross p.

414
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,940
But now we have prp.

415
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,770
There's an ordering ambiguity.

416
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,730
So you have to decide
which order do you

417
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,020
put that p and that r, and
the other p-- ppr, rpr,

418
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,469
prr-- right?

419
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:01,510
You can write out which
components you mean here.

420
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,140
For example, you mean
for the z component of a,

421
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,090
you're going to get
px ly, and ly px.

422
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,460
But within that, how do you
order the p's and the r's,

423
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,510
because ly contains px, and
in particular, it contains x.

424
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,860
So there's an
ordering ambiguity.

425
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,130
So just be a little bit
careful about this as a quantum

426
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,470
mechanical operator if
you do play with this.

427
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,050
But if you do it, and
you're thoughtful about it,

428
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,850
it's pretty easy to see that
it can be computed and checked

429
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,090
that, in fact, the
commutator vanishes.

430
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,311
So at this point, it's
tempting to say, aha!

431
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:38,810
There's an extra
conserved quantity.

432
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,180
We declare victory.

433
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,980
The problem is, this didn't
give us the symmetry.

434
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,960
This just told us there's
a conserved quantity.

435
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,361
What's the symmetry behind this?

436
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:50,110
What's the symmetry
that insures that this

437
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,070
is a conserved quantity?

438
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,630
It's obviously not rotations.

439
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,240
It's something else.

440
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
And so there are many
answers to this question.

441
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,840
One answer involves an explicit
expression for in phase space,

442
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,930
the change of
variables dx-- and this

443
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:15,730
is a variation that
depends on f of x and p.

444
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,560
So there's a little
vector parameter,

445
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,060
and the change of the
physical coordinates

446
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,796
depends on both the
coordinates and the momenta.

447
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,170
This is a slightly
strange thing,

448
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,450
because it's like a
change of variables

449
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,949
where the position gets mapped
into some non-linear function

450
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,590
of the positions and momenta.

451
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,580
That's a little bit weird,
but you can do this.

452
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,622
But I don't find it a
terribly satisfying answer.

453
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,913
And here's the answer I find
most satisfying-- it's not

454
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,700
terribly useful for
our present purposes,

455
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,520
but you're going to run
into this again in 805, when

456
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,717
you do what's called the
operator method for the Coulomb

457
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:48,092
potential, and it
turns out to be

458
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,686
an enormously useful machine.

459
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:51,060
We're not going
to use it in 804,

460
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,610
but I want to
advertise it for you.

461
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,590
I want to give you a
description, though,

462
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,950
that isn't the description
you're going to get in 805.

463
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,280
The description is
the following-- 1935,

464
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,880
guy named Fock,
crazy guy, amazing,

465
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,820
amazing physicist--
played a huge role

466
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,660
in the development of
quantum field theory.

467
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,290
I'm not exactly sure why he was
thinking about this problem,

468
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,500
but he was, and this was a
very sort of Soviet thing

469
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,150
to do at the time, I guess, to
be hard core and mathematical.

470
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,200
So off he was going,
computing things,

471
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,870
and he observed the
following fact--

472
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,260
how he observed this,
again, crazy long story.

473
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,170
He observed the following fact--
if you take a Kepler problem

474
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,010
and you work in momentum
space-- so you write everything

475
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,430
in terms of the momentum--
it turns out that the Kepler

476
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,370
problem, or he referred
to as the Kepler problem,

477
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,986
but I'll refer to it as
the Coulomb problem in 3D,

478
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:45,610
three spatial dimensions--
this is really crazy--

479
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,060
is exactly equivalent.

480
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,202
There's a change of variables--
it's kind of complicated,

481
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:51,910
but it's just a
projection, it turns out.

482
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,980
It's exactly equivalent to
the problem of a free particle

483
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,320
in four dimensions,
constrained to the surface

484
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,274
of a sphere-- to a three
sphere in four dimensions.

485
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,190
So you take a three
sphere in four dimensions.

486
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,090
You take a marble.

487
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,060
You kick it, but make sure
that it's stuck to the sphere.

488
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,900
It will move in
perfect circles, right?

489
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,400
Obviously-- it's
moving on a sphere,

490
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,110
it's just going to
move in great circles.

491
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,910
OK, that's nice and simple.

492
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,950
What's the symmetry
group of that system?

493
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,060
Well, the sphere is
invariant under any rotation

494
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,780
in four dimensions.

495
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

496
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,924
PROFESSOR: Ah, SO4--
there's a symmetry SO4--

497
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,340
special orthogonal
transformation.

498
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,965
Special means it
doesn't change length.

499
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:41,730
Orthogonal means
that it's a rotation.

500
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,930
So it's orthogonal rotations
in four dimensions,

501
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,060
and so now, this
should sound familiar,

502
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:57,780
because the angular
momentum group in 3D is SO3.

503
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,580
It's rotations that don't change
the length in three dimensions.

504
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,080
OK?

505
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,050
How many elements does it have?

506
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,587
How many conserved quantities
go along with this?

507
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:08,420
Well, how many conserved
quantities go along

508
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,878
with rotations in
three dimensions?

509
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:12,010

510
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,510
What's conserved by virtue of
rotational invariance in three

511
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,350
dimensions?

512
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,766
Angular momentum-- how many
components of angular momentum

513
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,500
are there?

514
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,880
Three, right, there are three.

515
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,420
So it turns out that
if you calculate in SO4

516
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,690
how many conserved quantities
are there, there are six.

517
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,430
And when you do this
mapping back down

518
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,510
from the free particle in 4D
to the Coulomb problem in 3D,

519
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,780
three of them are the l's,
and the other three of them

520
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,280
are this A vector--
comes out spot on.

521
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,447
So what it's telling you is
that the spectrum of hydrogen--

522
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,280
or at least the I
shouldn't say of hydrogen,

523
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,370
the spectrum of the
Coulomb system--

524
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,350
has an enhanced symmetry.

525
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,060
It's the symmetry group of
rotations in four dimensions.

526
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,990
Why?

527
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,790
I don't know, it's
just kind awesome.

528
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,220
But I think that's about
the best that can be said.

529
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,510
It's just true.

530
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,170
So for certain very
special potentials,

531
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,836
we find that this
sort of thing happens.

532
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,230
It happens in
other systems, too.

533
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,500
You discover that there
are accidental symmetries

534
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,379
in your system.

535
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,670
They shouldn't be referred
to as accidental symmetries.

536
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,970
They are enormously
nontrivial functions

537
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,774
of the rest of the
system, and we're

538
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:18,440
going to break the
symmetry in a minute,

539
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,856
and you'll see why we shouldn't
refer to it as accidental.

540
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:23,080
But in any case, the
answer to the question,

541
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,240
why do we have this giant
degeneracy in the Coulomb

542
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,900
problem-- why is it n squared
rather than 2l plus 1--

543
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,407
is that there is an
enhanced symmetry group.

544
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,490
There's more symmetry then
you would have thought.

545
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,980
And there's a conserved
quantity associated with it.

546
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,790
And that conserved
quantity corresponds

547
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,910
quantum mechanically
to an operator

548
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,070
that commutes with
the energy operator.

549
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,018
OK?

550
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,030
Yeah.

551
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,946
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

552
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:52,330

553
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,521
PROFESSOR: Indeed, indeed.

554
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:55,770
AUDIENCE: So how do you get
three conserved components

555
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,995
[INAUDIBLE].

556
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:58,870
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

557
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,770
What do I mean in classical
mechanics for a quantity

558
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,932
to be conserved?

559
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:05,140
I mean that the time rate
of change of that quantity,

560
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,620
under the classical dynamics,
under classical evolution,

561
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,990
is preserved.

562
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,600
So what's the quantum
mechanical version of that?

563
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,520
So the mechanical
version of that is, well,

564
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,310
can we say that d dt
of some operator--

565
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,740
or of some observable a is 0.

566
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,210
Does this makes sense?

567
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,740
No, because it turns out,
in the language we've

568
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,410
been using-- in the Schrodinger
evolution description

569
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,550
that we've been using--
this doesn't really

570
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,840
make sense, because this
thing is an operator.

571
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,790
That's not a quantity.

572
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,000
Quantity is something
you measure.

573
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,958
So what do you measure?

574
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,130
Do you measure the operator?

575
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,394
In a state, you measure
its expectation values.

576
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,810
You might measure
its eigenvalues,

577
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,450
but the more general thing
is expectation values.

578
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,640
So this is something
that depends on time,

579
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,660
because the wave function
depends on time-- psi of t.

580
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,390
OK, so the best to say
something is conserved,

581
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,863
is to say d dt of A is 0.

582
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:01,790

583
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,660
But we've seen
what the condition

584
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,200
is for the expectation
value to not change in time.

585
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,420
In general, for any
operator A, the time rate

586
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,430
of change of its
expectation value

587
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:27,840
is given by the
commutator of E with A.

588
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,690
I can do the symbols-- good.

589
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,880
OK, so in particular, if
this commutator vanishes,

590
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,660
if the commutator vanishes--
equals 0--, this is equal to--

591
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

592
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,217
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

593
00:28:46,217 --> 00:28:48,050
Well, the wave function
can be time variant,

594
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,030
and I'm going to
assume for the moment

595
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,650
that the energy operator
and the A operator are not,

596
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,600
themselves, explicitly
time dependent.

597
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,150
Yes, that's an
important assumption.

598
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,649
So let me just
assume for simplicity

599
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:58,281
that neither the energy nor the
operator A that I'm looking at

600
00:28:58,281 --> 00:28:59,530
are explicitly time dependent.

601
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,332
Like, it shouldn't
be, like, x plus tp.

602
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:03,290
That would be annoying.

603
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,634
So let me assume that
that's not the case.

604
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:07,300
You do have to deal
with that sometimes.

605
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,990
For example, if you are
dealing with a system that

606
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,495
changes in time, where there's
a background magnetic field,

607
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,370
or something like that,
that changes in time.

608
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,661
But module that sort of detail.

609
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:17,310
And also, there's an i h bar,
so where do the i h bars go?

610
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,010

611
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,760
Do the units make sense here?

612
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,560

613
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,550
A, A, good.

614
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,100
E and d dt-- whoops.

615
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,169
So where do the i h bars go?

616
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,460
Well, it can go on either side.

617
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,209
You have to tell me
if they go up or down.

618
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,216

619
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:38,590
What is the
Schrodinger equation?

620
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:45,760

621
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,980
Yeah, exactly, i h bar,
OK so we need an i h bar.

622
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,460
[LAUGHTER]

623
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,470
OK, this spring
has got to us all.

624
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,060
So now, in the case
that e with A as 0,

625
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,670
imagine we have an operator
a that commutes equal to 0.

626
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,190
Then d dt of the expectation
value of A in any state

627
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,210
is equal to 0.

628
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,080
And that's what
I'll call conserved.

629
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,466
So classically, to be
a conserved quantity

630
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:18,840
means that it's
time independent.

631
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,940
Quantum mechanically, to
be a conserved quantity

632
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,635
means that it commutes
with the energy.

633
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,760
Now, going back to the
question-- the question was,

634
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,150
look for angular momentum.

635
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,555
There are only two numbers you
can know at any moment in time.

636
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:30,430
You can't know three.

637
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,559
You can know the total
angular momentum, little l.

638
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,100
And you can know
the angular momentum

639
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,183
in a particular direction,
which we conventionally

640
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:37,862
call z-- little n, right?

641
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:39,820
But you can't know some
other angular momentum,

642
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,770
like angular momentum in x
direction simultaneously.

643
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,720
So what does it mean
to say that there

644
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,960
are three conserved quantities?

645
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,335
I can't know three conserved
quantities at the same time.

646
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:48,640
They're not even well defined
at some moment in time.

647
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,400
The answer is there are
three operators-- lx,

648
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,870
and ly, and lz--
which I will simply

649
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,200
write as l vector-- all of
which commute with E. So

650
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,510
while it's true that
systems don't have

651
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,460
definite values of lx,
ly and lz simultaneously,

652
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,730
nonetheless lx, ly
and lz all commute

653
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,245
with the energy operator.

654
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,370
And as a consequence, their
time expectation values

655
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,657
are all 0 in a
central potential.

656
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,490
So the time derivatives
of their expectation

657
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,890
are all 0s in a
central potential.

658
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,723
They're all constant
in a central potential.

659
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:21,854
Yeah.

660
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:22,770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

661
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:29,296

662
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:31,654
PROFESSOR: You mean 1 over r?

663
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:32,654
STUDENT: Yeah, 1 over r.

664
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:35,880

665
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,451
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if you don't have 1 over r,

666
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:39,950
do you get extra-special
things that

667
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,575
happen for other
potentials that aren't

668
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:43,756
1 over r, but something else?

669
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:44,672
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

670
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:48,514

671
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,180
PROFESSOR: It's not
quite a unique case.

672
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,120
So the question is-- this
is a very good question.

673
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,931
So the question is this-- this
is a great question-- look,

674
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:59,180
there's something peculiar
about 1 over r classically.

675
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,040
The orbit's closed.

676
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
You get ellipses.

677
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,220
You don't get
progressing ellipses.

678
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,250
That's what you get if
you have an n harmonic.

679
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,920
If you have an extra 1 over r
to the sixth term, or something,

680
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,040
a small correction
to 1 over r, which we

681
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,270
do in the real solar system.

682
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,040
It's a many body system
instead of a two-body system,

683
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,235
so r orbit doesn't close.

684
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:19,207
It's close, but--
so that's special.

685
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,290
And here we see that there's
an enhanced symmetry.

686
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,300
Are these things
related to each other?

687
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,260
So the answer is almost,
in the following sense--

688
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,200
for the harmonic oscillator,
we also have it close,

689
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,560
but there isn't a
Runge-Lenz vector.

690
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,102
However, the orbits
close, so there's

691
00:32:35,102 --> 00:32:36,685
something special
about that one, too.

692
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:38,210
Is there a conserved
quantity there?

693
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,600
And it turns out the
answer to that is yes.

694
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,391
There's an enhanced
symmetry there as well.

695
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,040
But it's not like this.

696
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,210
It doesn't lead to this
gigantic degeneracy.

697
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,780
There is just extra
structure that's

698
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,238
nice about the
harmonic oscillator.

699
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:51,400
But for the harmonic oscillator,
of course, it also closes.

700
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,684
It's not this orbits this.

701
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,100
So there's a nice
structure there,

702
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,450
but it's not quite so simple.

703
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,260

704
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,520
OK, yeah, one last question.

705
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,511
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Kepler's problem.

706
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:17,441
I was wondering if it's at all
correct thinking [INAUDIBLE]

707
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:21,385
symmetry or
degeneracy [INAUDIBLE]

708
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:22,890
equal time instead
of equal area?

709
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,662
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's not unrelated.

710
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,620
I don't know how to make
that connection sharp,

711
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,391
but the thing I can say sharp--
so the question is, look,

712
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:31,640
is that conserved quantity
somehow related to the fact

713
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,880
that there's equal time in
equal-- equal areas swept out

714
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,035
in equal time at all
points in the orbit?

715
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,910
Which is a true thing
about a Kepler problem.

716
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,220
That's a good observation.

717
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,340
I don't know how to
make that connection,

718
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,990
but it is true in
the following sense--

719
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,114
that both of those facts
are guaranteed by the fact

720
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:48,170
that you have closed orbits
with a particular ratio.

721
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,270
And that is, indeed,
can be blamed

722
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,939
on the conservation of
the Runge-Lenz vector.

723
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,480
I don't know how to make that
connection direct and explicit,

724
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,460
but indeed it is.

725
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,550
So that's fun question.

726
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,010
I'll have to think about that.

727
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,792
That's a good one.

728
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,624

729
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,790
One of the totally awesome
things about teaching 804

730
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,895
is that every
single time, someone

731
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:09,520
asks a question I've
never even thought

732
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,070
of before-- forget
never answered.

733
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,655
Never even thought of.

734
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:12,655
I never thought of that.

735
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:14,909
It's a great question.

736
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,679
OK, so everyone cool
with the degeneracy?

737
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,110
We have this
gigantic degeneracy.

738
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,409
So knowing what the degeneracy
is, or where it's coming from,

739
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,199
at least more or
less-- is progress.

740
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,630
But if you really understand
why something is conserved,

741
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,989
then you can break
that conservation.

742
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,590
You can break that degeneracy.

743
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,190
So here's my question,
is it possible-- can

744
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:46,240
we, or indeed must we, can we
break or lift this degeneracy?

745
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,239
So first, let me tell you
what those words mean.

746
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,350

747
00:34:51,350 --> 00:35:00,130
So we have this
gigantic degeneracy

748
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,504
of the n squared of
the Coulomb potential.

749
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:06,170
Can we break that
degeneracy or lift it?

750
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,461
What I mean by lift the
degeneracy, what I mean by lift

751
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:09,837
the degeneracy is
the following--

752
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:11,586
suppose I have a system
that's degenerate,

753
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:13,090
so it's got two
energy eigenstates

754
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,440
with the same energy eigenvalue.

755
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,330
So this is energy.

756
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,256
Then if I can kick the
system in some way,

757
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:20,830
or modify it, or bend it such
that the energy levels are

758
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,580
no longer to
degenerate, one state

759
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,137
has been lifted above the other.

760
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:26,970
And so we use the word
to lift a degeneracy.

761
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:29,011
Now you can see that
they're two different states

762
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:30,300
by measuring the energies.

763
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,330
It's also said to
split a degeneracy,

764
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,790
or to break a degeneracy.

765
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,117
So those are just words.

766
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:36,950
OK, so can we break or
lift this degeneracy?

767
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,170

768
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,792
So sure.

769
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,000
How do we break a degeneracy?

770
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,210
How do we lift a degeneracy?

771
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,610

772
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,860
We need to break the symmetry.

773
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,825

774
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:56,200
So if we don't
have the symmetry,

775
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,366
we won't get the degeneracy.

776
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:58,630
We've seen this before.

777
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,100
So first off, let's
think about what

778
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,600
are the two symmetries
that we want?

779
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,660
Well, we got this
degeneracy of 2l plus 1

780
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,650
from spherical symmetry.

781
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,210
And we got this extra degeneracy
of n squared from conservation

782
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,550
of the Runge-Lenz vector.

783
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,300
And conservation of
the Runge-Lenz vector

784
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,400
came from the fact that we had
exactly the Coulomb system.

785
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,940
So anything that isn't
exactly the Coulomb system,

786
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,470
but is still
rotationally invariant,

787
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,280
should still have the
2l plus 1 degeneracy,

788
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,260
but not the n
squared degeneracy--

789
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,060
like the harmonic
oscillator, for example.

790
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,800
So let's change the system.

791
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,330
Let's find a small correction
to the system that leaves it

792
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,080
mostly the Coulomb problem,
but with some small correction.

793
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,830
So what comes to mind?

794
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,290
So one good way to think
about a physical, natural way

795
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,380
to break this degeneracy,
to break the symmetry,

796
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,555
is to think a real system
that's described by the Coulomb

797
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:50,055
potential.

798
00:36:50,055 --> 00:36:52,330
So the system that we usually
talk about is hydrogen.

799
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,444
Hydrogen is the proton.

800
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,360
It's got a plus charge,
and it's got electron.

801
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,510
And it's attractive with
a minus E squared upon r.

802
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,239
So in hydrogen, is this the
energy operator for hydrogen?

803
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,280
Is this a good description
of the energy operator

804
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,120
for hydrogen?

805
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,632
It's a good start, but
it's not exactly right,

806
00:37:10,632 --> 00:37:11,590
for a bunch of reasons.

807
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,620
And in fact, in your
first problem set,

808
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,980
when you computed the time
it takes for hydrogen,

809
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:23,564
classically, to decay from
the classical Bohr radius,

810
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:26,230
one of the things you discovered
is that the electron starts out

811
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,330
being non-relativistic, but very
rapidly becomes relativistic.

812
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,030
And rapidly is 10 to
the minus 15 seconds.

813
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,850
This is a non-relativistic, p
squared upon 2m kinetic energy.

814
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,820
That's probably not a
perfect approximation.

815
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:48,020
So the first example is going
to be relativistic corrections.

816
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,510
Now, will relativistic
corrections

817
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,595
break rotational symmetry?

818
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:54,260

819
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,370
They can't, because
relativity doesn't say,

820
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,580
this is the z direction.

821
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,080
In fact, it does
quite the opposite.

822
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,621
Relativity, among
other things, says,

823
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:02,880
don't get too hung up on
what's the z direction.

824
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,920
But relativistic corrections
will not break the symmetry.

825
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,420
So if we include
relativistic corrections

826
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:20,270
to the kinetic energy,
this will change E,

827
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,910
change the energy operator.

828
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,740
But it will preserve
the rotational symmetry.

829
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,899
E with l is equal to 0.

830
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,690
So we won't break this
rotational symmetry,

831
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,160
so we'll preserve the 2l plus 1.

832
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,890
So let's check to see
that this is true.

833
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,940
So to check to see
that this is true,

834
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,950
let's actually estimate out
the correction to the energy

835
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,640
due to the first nontrivial
relativistic effect

836
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
in the atom.

837
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,970
The first nontrivial,
relativistic effect

838
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,220
can be calculated
[INAUDIBLE] kinetic energy

839
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,780
in special relativity,
of a particle of mass m.

840
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,650
So that's easy.

841
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:06,130
It's the total energy is
the square root of m squared

842
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,842
c to the 4th plus p squared
c squared minus mc squared.

843
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:13,800
That's the rest energy.

844
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,830
That's the total energy, so
this is the kinetic energy.

845
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,360
But this is equal to--
well, if we pull out

846
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,925
a factor of m squared
c squared, this

847
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:31,550
is m c squared times the square
root of 1 plus p squared over n

848
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,054
squared c squared minus 1.

849
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,470
And now if we
Taylor expand this--

850
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,100
because if the momentum is small
compared to mc squared-- or mc,

851
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,850
I should say-- the momentum is
small compared to mc which is,

852
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,170
morally speaking,
at low velocity is,

853
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,870
the velocity is
small compared to c,

854
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,070
then this is 1 plus
a small number,

855
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:56,120
and we can Taylor expand this to
get 1 plus 1/2 a small number.

856
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,060
And the 1s will cancel,
giving us only 1/2.

857
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,630
So this is going to be equal
to 1/2 of that small number,

858
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,610
p squared over m
squared c squared,

859
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,820
times mc squared
upstairs, giving us

860
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,100
the first term, which
is p squared upon 2m.

861
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,360
That's the familiar
classical kinetic energy.

862
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,170
Rock on.

863
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,320
What's next correction?

864
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,400
The next correction is the next
term for this Taylor series,

865
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,110
which is going to involve
this quantity squared,

866
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,470
so it's going to be p to
the 4th over m to the 4th, c

867
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,830
the 4th times mc to the 4th.

868
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,760
The coefficient is a minus
1/8, so we get minus p

869
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,790
to the 4th over 8m
cubed c squared.

870
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,380

871
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,780
And that's down by a
factor of m squared

872
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,900
c squared from this
guy, n of p squared

873
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,750
upstairs-- which is
what you'd get-- p

874
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,080
squared m squared,
over c squared, OK?

875
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,890
So the correction to the kinetic
energy for a given momentum p

876
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,490
is to correct it down
by p to the 4th term.

877
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,580
Everyone cool with that?

878
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,418
Yeah.

879
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,150
AUDIENCE: Why do you make
the assumption [INAUDIBLE].

880
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,390
PROFESSOR: Because
you, like Schrodinger,

881
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,580
did problem Set One.

882
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,050
And problem Set One said, if
you have an electron at the Bohr

883
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,530
radius classically, its
velocity is about 1/400

884
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,910
of the speed of light.

885
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,350
200?

886
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,005
It's small.

887
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:14,505
It's a couple of
orders of magnitude

888
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,838
smaller than the speed of light.

889
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,890
So that number, that ratio
there, is 1 upon 200,

890
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,462
or 400-- I don't
remember-- squared.

891
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:22,920
That's a very small
number, so it's

892
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,210
a reasonable approximation.

893
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

894
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,510
PROFESSOR: Because what
is the typical-- that's

895
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,150
an excellent question.

896
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,108
So why am I talking about
it as if the electron

897
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:32,600
is sitting at that radius?

898
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,680
And the answer is, well, look--
what is the average momentum?

899
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,299
What is the average
value of p squared in,

900
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,340
let's say, the ground
state of the hydrogen atom?

901
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,589
What's the average value of p?

902
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:45,650

903
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,150
What must be the
average value of p

904
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,570
in the ground state
of the hydrogen atom?

905
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,090
Zero on two grounds--
first off, p is a vector,

906
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,580
and the ground state of hydrogen
is rotationally invariant.

907
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,663
It doesn't break anything.

908
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,630
Secondly, it's not
going anywhere.

909
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,588
It's a bound state, so
it's just sitting there.

910
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,640
It's got an average
momentum of 0.

911
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,980
If it carried momentum,
it would be cruising.

912
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,470
So it's got average momentum 0.

913
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,553
OK, fine, but what's the
average momentum squared?

914
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,414
What's the average of p squared?

915
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:11,080
We can actually do
out that calculation.

916
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,705
You're going to have to do that
calculation on the problem set.

917
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,315
And it's a small number.

918
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:17,190
And it's, in fact,
almost exactly what

919
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,890
you'd guess classically
from the Bohr radius.

920
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,456
So you have to know the
h bar to compute the Bohr

921
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,040
radius in the first place.

922
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,530
So the answer is, to the
best of anyone's ability

923
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,559
to define what's the
momentum, or the typical scale

924
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,350
of momentum, that
typical scale of momentum

925
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,850
for the electron in the
ground state of hydrogen

926
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,340
is extraordinarily small
compared to the speed of light

927
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,749
by a factor of 100, 200, or 400.

928
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:39,040
Does that answer your question?

929
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

930
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,811
PROFESSOR: It's a
very good question.

931
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,750
OK, so here's the
kinetic energy.

932
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,881
And by the way,
another way to say

933
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:46,380
that this approximation
must be good

934
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,080
is that we've already
computed-- ignoring

935
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,246
the relativistic correction--
we computed the ground

936
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:52,070
state of energy,
and it was 13.6 Ev,

937
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,450
which is pretty good, since
the binding energy of hydrogen

938
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,370
is about 13.6 Ev.

939
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,640
So apparently, that was
a good approximation.

940
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,160
And you might be disgusted
by answer analysis like that,

941
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,117
but that's what physics is.

942
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:05,950
You write down some
stupid, cockamamie model

943
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,350
that you know is
wrong, but if it

944
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,522
does a good job of fitting
the data, you declare triumph,

945
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:11,480
and you call Stockholm.

946
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,440
[LAUGHTER]

947
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,300
So it depends on the
problem you've just

948
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,210
solved approximately.

949
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,080
So here's the first correction.

950
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,570
And now, what this
tells us is therefore,

951
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,675
the energy of
hydrogen-- or at least

952
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:31,050
a better model of
hydrogen-- I'll

953
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:37,070
call it hydrogen tilde--
is equal to E Coulomb

954
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:43,450
minus p to the 4th over
8m cubed c squared.

955
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:53,540

956
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,870
OK so this, however, we
know is small compared

957
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,812
to the kinetic energy, because
13.6 is pretty close to 13.6.

958
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,270
Notice I didn't include the
rest of the significant digits.

959
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,010
So this must be in the
insignificant digits.

960
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,460
So this must be small.

961
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,460
So here's what I
want to ask-- we

962
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,400
know that the energy of
the Coulomb problem, nlm,

963
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,660
is equal to e0 squared
minus e0 squared

964
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,400
over n squared,
independent of l and m.

965
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,090
What's the energy in this
toy model of hydrogen

966
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,580
that includes the first
relativistic correction-- nlm.

967
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,436
Well, to answer that question
we have to resolve the energy

968
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,560
eigenvalue equation, right?

969
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,310
We have to refined the
energy eigenstates,

970
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,610
and we have to solve that.

971
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,410
And this is going to be a much
worse problem, because it's

972
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,201
going to involve a p
to the 4th term, which

973
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:41,820
is going to involve
four derivatives.

974
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,580
That sounds horrible.

975
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,040
Can anyone think of a better
way to just approximate,

976
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,640
estimate the magnitude and the
value of the leading correction

977
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,163
from this quantity?

978
00:44:53,163 --> 00:44:53,663
Yeah.

979
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:56,960

980
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,865
AUDIENCE: Some variation
on take an eigenvalue,

981
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,933
plug it in, see
what the error is,

982
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:06,630
correct for that error--
something like that.

983
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,880
PROFESSOR: There's an iterative
method for doing that.

984
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
It's a very good guess, but
there's an even easier way

985
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,505
to estimate it.

986
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:15,320
That's something we will
call perturbation theory when

987
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,640
we do this in 805.

988
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,419
And doing that systematically
is exactly the right answer.

989
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:21,710
However I want you to do just
the leading part of that.

990
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,110
Yeah.

991
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,310
AUDIENCE: Dimensional analysis.

992
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,518
PROFESSOR: Oh, dimensional
analysis would be awesome.

993
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:29,080
That's fantastic, brilliant.

994
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,387
So how would you compute p?

995
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:34,123

996
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,570
OK, so we didn't calculate p.

997
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,560
You can do a
dimensional analysis

998
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,018
and get a p, because
you have an e,

999
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:39,630
you have an l, you
can probably do it.

1000
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,004
But here's the
problem with that,

1001
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,530
though-- this is the correct
first answer to any question

1002
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,230
of this kind--
correct first answer

1003
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,826
is plug in dimensional
analysis, and get an estimate

1004
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:48,950
for the order of magnitude.

1005
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,030
But we want more than the
order of magnitude here.

1006
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,760
We're interested in
splitting the degeneracy

1007
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,154
due to this interaction.

1008
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,570
So what that means is we want
to see that different values

1009
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,330
use of l lead to
different energy.

1010
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,560
What we care about
is the l dependence

1011
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,980
that comes out of
this correction.

1012
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,230
And we're not going to be
able to get the l dependence

1013
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,390
from dimensional analysis,
because l is an integer.

1014
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,300
It is dimensionless.

1015
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,750
Yeah, so that will give
you the correct magnitude,

1016
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,220
and that is the
first thing you do.

1017
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,934
What's the second thing you do?

1018
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,600
AUDIENCE: Stick in
the expectation value

1019
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,365
of p to the 4th.

1020
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:22,240
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

1021
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,670
Let's just stick in the
expectation value p to the 4th.

1022
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,420
That's not exactly
the right thing to do,

1023
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,987
but if this is small, that's
probably pretty reasonable.

1024
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:31,320
And what you'll find when you
do it systematically using

1025
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,520
perturbation theory, as
was pointed out earlier,

1026
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,780
we can take the entire system,
the entire energy eigenvalue

1027
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,800
equation-- we can
think of this 1 over m

1028
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,439
cubed c squared
as a small number,

1029
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:43,730
and we can do perturbation
theory on that small number.

1030
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,120
We can Taylor expand everything
in that small number.

1031
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,690
And when you Taylor expand
the exact equation, what

1032
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,470
you discover is the leading
term in that Taylor expansion

1033
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,040
is the expectation value
p to the 4th over 8m cubed

1034
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,260
c squared.

1035
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,970
OK, so this is a
fantastic guess.

1036
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,490
OK, so let's compute it.

1037
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,930
So E hydrogen is going to be
equal to E nlm, which I'm just

1038
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,020
to write as minus
E0 over m squared.

1039
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:23,600

1040
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,210
OK, so what is the
correct answer here?

1041
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,450
So it's this quantity
minus-- so this

1042
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,940
is making it more tightly bound.

1043
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,790
Notice the sign,
because p to the 4th

1044
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,770
is strictly positive
if p is real.

1045
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,670
So minus E0 over m
squared, and if you go out

1046
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,711
and you do this expectation
value, which I really

1047
00:47:40,711 --> 00:47:43,839
should have put on the
problem set-- oh, I still can.

1048
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,380
It hasn't been posted yet, so
it'll be posted this afternoon.

1049
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,600
But I won't.

1050
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,450
It's not that bad, actually.

1051
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,680
[LAUGHTER]

1052
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,923
Matt, what do you think?

1053
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:56,855
AUDIENCE: No!

1054
00:47:56,855 --> 00:48:00,240
[LAUGHS]

1055
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,680
PROFESSOR: We'll discuss
this afterwards, OK?

1056
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,299
Which may or may not
appear on your problem set.

1057
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,840
So if you go ahead and you do
this calculation, what you find

1058
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,497
is the correction is En
squared, so E0 squared over n

1059
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,580
to the 4th-- this time it
really is n to the 4th--

1060
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,370
and now you have to worry
about dimensional analysis.

1061
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,400
This is two energies.

1062
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,806
We want one energy, divided
by-- wait for it-- mc squared,

1063
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:22,430
because it's a
relativistic correction.

1064
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,110
That shouldn't be
too surprising.

1065
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,765
Times the quantity
4n over-- and here

1066
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:32,932
where life gets awesome--
l plus 1/2 minus 3.

1067
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:37,550
[LAUGHTER]

1068
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,990
PROFESSOR: You laugh,
but I feel delighted

1069
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,480
by this for so many reasons.

1070
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,090
One is, that's beautiful.

1071
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,650
What a crazy
combination of symbols.

1072
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,100
But the second
and more important

1073
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:52,390
one is, look it has an l in it,
and the l is downstairs, right?

1074
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,891
That's good.

1075
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,140
It has more leverage that way.

1076
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,960
But so we've got
this l appearing,

1077
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,780
so the energy depends on l.

1078
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,200
Good, we've broken
the degeneracy.

1079
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,957
Different values of l
give different energies.

1080
00:49:05,957 --> 00:49:07,165
So let's do that graphically.

1081
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:12,510

1082
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:17,130
So in particular,
what this tells

1083
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:23,780
us is that now while the
Coulomb energy commuted

1084
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,950
with the Runge-Lenz
vector, it must be true

1085
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,960
that the energy of
this model of hydrogen,

1086
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,620
which includes the first
relativistic correction,

1087
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,960
does not commute with
the Runge-Lenz vector.

1088
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,810
And indeed, if you
check this-- which

1089
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,160
is effortful, but
not intellectually

1090
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,870
difficult-- indeed,
it doesn't vanish.

1091
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,540
And the failure of this
conservation equation,

1092
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,430
the failure this commutational
relation to vanish,

1093
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,720
tell us that it's
possible for the system

1094
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,760
to not be degenerate.

1095
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,430
And lo and behold,
it is not degenerate.

1096
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,680
OK?

1097
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,500
Yeah.

1098
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,120
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
to clarify something that--

1099
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,424
did you say before that the
actual first term when you

1100
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:08,532
encounter relativity just
includes substituting

1101
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:11,516
the non-relativistic
p to the 4th?

1102
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:12,140
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1103
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,010
Sorry, I should have said that.

1104
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,190
There are other things are
important for relativity

1105
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,648
that we'll come to
in a little bit.

1106
00:50:16,648 --> 00:50:18,700
But if you just look
at the kinetic energy,

1107
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,172
this is the first
non-trivial correction.

1108
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:23,020
Yeah.

1109
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,330
AUDIENCE: So we still have
the 2l plus 1 degeneracy.

1110
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,950
PROFESSOR: We still have the
2l plus 1 degeneracy, exactly.

1111
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,796
Because does this correction
violate rotational invariance?

1112
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:32,670
No, that's p squared.

1113
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,961
That's a scalar under rotation.

1114
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:36,070
It's just the
number, not a vector.

1115
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:42,320
But E still commutes with l.

1116
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,310
And you see that because this
is independent of little m.

1117
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,160
This is the mass
of the electron.

1118
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,460
So this is independent of
the quantum number little m.

1119
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,630
It only depends on the
quantum number little l.

1120
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,220
So indeed, it is
still degenerate.

1121
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,997
So let's go through this and
see the degeneracy explicitly.

1122
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:01,330
And let me do that by drawing
you the following diagram.

1123
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:08,780
So what happens if we have
E1, which is the ground state?

1124
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,670
It has some energy which is
negative, which is minus E0.

1125
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,700
And when we include this first
correction, what does it do?

1126
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,542
Well, it decreases
it by some amount.

1127
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:22,640

1128
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,962
Everyone cool with that?

1129
00:51:23,962 --> 00:51:25,170
It doesn't change the number.

1130
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,860
It doesn't split any degeneracy,
because there was only

1131
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,360
one ground state
in the first place,

1132
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,590
because l had to
be 0 when n is 1.

1133
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,690
l has to be one less
than n or smaller.

1134
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,780
And if n is 1, l has to be 0.

1135
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,030
It can't be any smaller
than 0, so it's 0.

1136
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,530
There's just a one state,
with degeneracy 2, 0

1137
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,850
plus 1, which is 1.

1138
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,760
OK so that's fine.

1139
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,400
It just changes the ground
state by some amount.

1140
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,380
Let's consider the
second excited level.

1141
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,741
So in the second excited
level, we have the states--

1142
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,490
and let me name this
slightly differently,

1143
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,170
so this has energy minus E0.

1144
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,490
The ground state had l
equals 0, and m equals 0.

1145
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,370
It had to.

1146
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,770
For the second excited
state, n equals 2,

1147
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,180
how many states are there?

1148
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,470
2 squared is 4, so there are
four states, two, three, four.

1149
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,640
And what are their
values of l and m?

1150
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,660
Well, if n is 2, l
can be either 0 or 1.

1151
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,650
If it's 0, then m has to be 0.

1152
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,455
If it's 1, m could be
1, or it could be 0,

1153
00:52:23,455 --> 00:52:27,170
or it could be minus 1.

1154
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,700
So this, again, is lm, lm, lm.

1155
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,280
So those are the four states
with energy E2 in the hydrogen

1156
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:33,986
atom.

1157
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:36,360
And now when we ask, what are
the energies of these three

1158
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,320
states, when we include this
so-called fine structure, what

1159
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,660
is this going to do?

1160
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,940
Well, the ground state is
going to get pushed down

1161
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,600
by some amount.

1162
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,820

1163
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,290
I should draw this differently
to make it more vivid.

1164
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:52,957

1165
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:55,415
This gets pushed down by some
amount, with some value of l.

1166
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:57,330
l here is 0.

1167
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,250
But for these
three states, which

1168
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,420
all have the same
value of little l, 1,

1169
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,360
the denominator is larger.

1170
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,260
So the amount by which it
gets pushed down is less.

1171
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,384
So these three states
get pushed down less,

1172
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:09,800
but the same amount
as each other.

1173
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,830

1174
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,730
That cool?

1175
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:22,350
So these three states--
degeneracy is 3,

1176
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,800
and this state degeneracy is 1.

1177
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,410
Now, notice that 1
plus 3 is equal to 4

1178
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,130
is equal to n squared.

1179
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,470
So these states split
into multiplets-- groups

1180
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,135
of states-- which have
to have the same energy

1181
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:42,214
by rotational invariance.

1182
00:53:42,214 --> 00:53:43,630
If they have l
equas 1, there must

1183
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,260
be three states with the
same energy-- there must be.

1184
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,020
And states with l equals 0,
there's just the one state.

1185
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,740

1186
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,520
And if we did the
same thing for E3,

1187
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,560
let's just think about
what would happen.

1188
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,140
So I'm just going
to write the l.

1189
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,431
I'm not going to include the m.

1190
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:03,940
We have the l equals 0 times 1.

1191
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,500
We have the l equals
1 state, times 3.

1192
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,060
And we have l equals 2 state.

1193
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,180
And how many states are there
in the l equals 2 state?

1194
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,180
Times 5, good.

1195
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,860
And again, this gets
pushed down to some value.

1196
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,360
This gets pushed
down to some value.

1197
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,800
This gets pushed
down to some value,

1198
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,012
where this is one,
three, and five.

1199
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,470
And again, these
add up to 9, which

1200
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,180
is 3 squared-- the degeneracy.

1201
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,930
So by turning on the
relativistic corrections,

1202
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,170
we break this degeneracy.

1203
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,170
We lift this degeneracy.

1204
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:38,104
You break the symmetry,
you lift the degeneracy.

1205
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:39,520
Now, unfortunately,
this isn't one

1206
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,700
we can control by turning
a dial in the lab.

1207
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,140
No experiment that
I can do in the lab

1208
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,160
will change the value
of the speed of light.

1209
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,425

1210
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:49,925
Well, actually there
are experiments

1211
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,966
that will change the value
of the speed of light.

1212
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:55,269
If you work in medium, the
effective speed of light

1213
00:54:55,269 --> 00:54:55,810
is different.

1214
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,804
So that's going to change
relativistic effects.

1215
00:54:57,804 --> 00:54:58,720
So that's interesting.

1216
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,178
That tells you that you can
actually vary this continuously

1217
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:04,220
if you can vary continuously
the index of refraction

1218
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,569
of the ambient system.

1219
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,610
I invite you to think
about how you might do that

1220
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,925
experimentally, because
it's a fun question.

1221
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:13,940

1222
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,150
OK, however, what
I'd really like

1223
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,660
is something where
Professor Evan in his lab

1224
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:26,730
can actually turn a dial,
and change the spectrum

1225
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,870
in a way that explicitly
breaks the symmetry.

1226
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,350
Meanwhile, I also
want an example

1227
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:32,570
that breaks the
rotational invariance.

1228
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,910
I want to break the 2l
plus 1 states up into 2l

1229
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,550
plus 1 states with
different energies.

1230
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,876
I want to make them
depend on the angular

1231
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,000
momentum in some direction.

1232
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,095
What must I do in order
to lift that degeneracy?

1233
00:55:42,095 --> 00:55:47,670

1234
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,120
AUDIENCE: Add a magnetic field.

1235
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,510
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

1236
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,200
If you add a magnetic
field, why is that

1237
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,449
going to break the degeneracy?

1238
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:56,194

1239
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:57,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1240
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:02,255

1241
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:03,630
PROFESSOR: Give
me an answer that

1242
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,610
depends, not on your
knowledge of chemistry,

1243
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:09,860
but give me an answer that
depends on symmetries.

1244
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,342
Why doe turning on
a magnetic field

1245
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:13,800
have the potential to split
the degeneracy of the 2l plus 1

1246
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,120
states?

1247
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,840
AUDIENCE: You don't have
rotational symmetry.

1248
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,830
PROFESSOR: Thank you, exactly.

1249
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,680
You have no rotational
symmetry, exactly.

1250
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,760
So that's pretty good.

1251
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:29,330
So let's break the 2l plus 1 by
breaking rotational symmetry.

1252
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:32,672
There are many ways we could
break rotational symmetry.

1253
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:34,130
We could turn on
an electric field.

1254
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,910
We could turn on
a magnetic field.

1255
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:39,597
We could put a
shovel in the room.

1256
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,930
But anything that breaks
rotational symmetry will do it,

1257
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,250
but a very convenient way is
to do it with a magnetic field.

1258
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,958
Magnetic field is
particularly beautiful.

1259
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:50,060
So this is effect is now
call the Zeeman effect.

1260
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,190
I believe it was
Faraday-- one of

1261
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:59,580
the classic electromagnetists
of the 19th century attempted

1262
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,770
to look at the spectral
lines coming off glowing gas,

1263
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,790
and see if they
changed by turning

1264
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,407
on an electric or
a magnetic field.

1265
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:07,990
It turns out to be
a tricky experiment

1266
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,130
to do, because you need to
have a very well-controlled

1267
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,380
magnetic field,
otherwise what you

1268
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,790
get is just a bunch of schmutz.

1269
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,380
So to get a clean
spectrum, you have

1270
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,550
to have a very uniform magnetic
field, which is not trivial.

1271
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,800
It has to be time independent.

1272
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,477
So Zeeman, at the very end of
the 19th century-- in fact,

1273
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,310
this experiment was
done, I believe, in '96.

1274
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:28,790

1275
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,170
So I think the paper
came out in '97

1276
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,455
but the experiment
was done in '96.

1277
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:35,580
Zeeman did this experiment.

1278
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,210
He said look, if i turn
on a magnetic field

1279
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,418
next to a hot, glowing gas
and look the spectrum that

1280
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:43,060
comes off, anything
happen to it?

1281
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,931
Why would you think that
anything might happen?

1282
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,930
And the answer to this
one is really quite nice.

1283
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,130
Look, if we compute
the energy, the energy

1284
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,710
is going to be
equal to the Coulomb

1285
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,030
energy plus a correction,
which is the following--

1286
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,540
if you think of the atom
as an electron that carries

1287
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,599
some angular momentum in
the presence of a proton,

1288
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,140
if you think of the electron as
a thing carrying some angular

1289
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,681
momentum, and a
thing with a charge--

1290
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:09,940
it has a charge and
angular momentum.

1291
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,100
It's going to have
magnetic moment, mu.

1292
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,800
And the magnetic
moment is going to be

1293
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:21,000
equal to the current of the
charge times the area swept out

1294
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,220
divided by c, because we
work with sensible units.

1295
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:36,750
And this is equal to minus--
for the case of the atom--

1296
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:41,180
minus mu, the magnetic
moment of the system

1297
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,920
dotted into the magnetic
field that you turn on

1298
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,670
in the background.

1299
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,420
So this is a background
magnetic field.

1300
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,049
I am turning on an
electromagnet, which

1301
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:50,090
induces a magnetic field
in some known direction,

1302
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,670
with some known magnitude.

1303
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,630
So my dial is the
magnitude of that B field.

1304
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,920
I could make it large,
or I could make it small.

1305
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,010
And it's in a known direction.

1306
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,034
And the point is, our electron
because it's orbiting,

1307
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,700
because it carries
some angular momentum

1308
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,506
and it carries some in charge,
has some magnetic moment.

1309
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:08,130
So it behaves like
a little bar magnet.

1310
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,200
And that bar magnet wants to
anti-align with the background

1311
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
magnetic field that
I've turned on.

1312
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,550
So there's an energy penalty
to not being aligned.

1313
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:21,550
This is the usual dipole-dipole
potential from electrostatics.

1314
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:29,160
OK and mu here is equal to minus
E over 2mc-- angular momentum.

1315
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,920

1316
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,370
So this can be computed from
a simple model of the atom.

1317
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,540

1318
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,930
Whatever, it's easy to compute.

1319
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,201
So this is slightly
annoying, because if E

1320
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:46,700
is in some arbitrary direction,
let's just simplify our life

1321
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,392
and say that's equal to
E Coulomb minus mu B.

1322
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:52,350
And I want to turn on a
magnetic field of known

1323
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,650
amplitude in a known direction.

1324
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,899
Let's call it the z direction.

1325
00:59:54,899 --> 00:59:57,480
So this is mu z.

1326
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:03,040
But this mu z, that's just mu
z is lz times minus E over 2mc.

1327
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:09,190
So this is going to
be plus E over 2mc,

1328
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,874
Bz-- I'm going to put
this all together, Bz Lz.

1329
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:16,440

1330
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,321
Everyone cool with that?

1331
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:19,820
So where this is
coming from, again,

1332
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,000
is just the angular momentum
is telling you the velocity.

1333
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,380
The velocity is telling
you the current.

1334
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,790
And then the area is the radius.

1335
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:33,581
So that's what's giving you
the radius and the angular

1336
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:34,080
momentum.

1337
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,820

1338
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,907
So this is our energy.

1339
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:42,115
What does this tell you
about the energy eigenvalues?

1340
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:45,340

1341
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,340
They depend on m, right?

1342
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,250
And do we have to solve
the energy eigenvalue

1343
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,080
equation again?

1344
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,060
No, because our energy
eigenfunctions of Ec

1345
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,950
are proportional to
ylm, so they're already

1346
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:59,300
eigenfunctions of lz.

1347
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,050
So when I take this beast, and
I act on the wave functions

1348
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:08,440
I erased, but on the 1 upon
little r, capital R, sub nl, y

1349
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,810
sub lm-- when I act
on the ylm's, this

1350
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:14,880
is just going to give
me h bar m, right?

1351
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,877
So this is just a constant when
acting on the Coulomb energy

1352
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:19,460
eigenfunction.

1353
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,460
So this is a much
easier problem.

1354
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,793
That way, we don't even have
to make any approximations.

1355
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:29,280
We can just say exactly energy
Zeeman is equal to minus E0

1356
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:40,960
upon n squared, nlm
plus E h bar upon 2mc,

1357
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,650
Bz-- the background
magnetic field,

1358
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:47,730
and this is the m of electron
mass-- times little m.

1359
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,720
And I'm going to write
little m sub l, just

1360
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,676
to distinguish little
m sub l from m sub E.

1361
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:58,050
So when we turn
on the prediction

1362
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:02,280
here, when we turn on the
magnetic field a la Zeeman,

1363
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,590
our energy levels will
get split according

1364
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,160
to the different values of m.

1365
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,812
Now if instead of working
with the pure Coulomb system,

1366
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,270
if we were in fact
a little clever,

1367
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,490
and we'd already noticed that
there's a fine structure--

1368
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,600
because they already
knew that there

1369
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,100
was a fine structure
at this point--

1370
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,380
they could see the
different spectra

1371
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,936
in lines coming off of hot gas.

1372
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:26,310
So it's just an
experimental fact

1373
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,893
you can't turn off
the fine structure.

1374
01:02:27,893 --> 01:02:33,507
This is going to be equal
to e nlm of our correction

1375
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:35,840
to the hydrogen atom, with
the fine structure corrected.

1376
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,670
So the l equals 1 states and
the l equals 0 states are split.

1377
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,967
Let's focus, for example, on E2.

1378
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,550
So these guys have
a different energy.

1379
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,341
The l equals 1 guys
have a different energy

1380
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:47,970
than the l equals 0 guys.

1381
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,990
What does this predict
is going to happen

1382
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,240
if I look at my spectral line?

1383
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,930
So what this predicts
is the following--

1384
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,630
it says that if you
have some spectrum that

1385
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:08,660
looks like this-- so this is
as a function of wavelength

1386
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,650
and i'm looking literally
at what comes off a prism.

1387
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,050
I'm looking at spectrum lines.

1388
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,740
And I'll have a line here.

1389
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,900
And these are going to
be the l equals 0 states.

1390
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,770
This is n equals 2.

1391
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,860
And then there's the
l equals 1 states.

1392
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,820
This is with zero magnetic
field-- Bz equals 0.

1393
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,820

1394
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:38,040
If we turn on a magnetic
field, Bz not equal to zero,

1395
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,720
what should we see?

1396
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,140
Well, what happens
to this state?

1397
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,610
Nothing-- it's the same thing,
because the m is strictly 0,

1398
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,050
so it's the same value.

1399
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:50,850
And this guy, what
happens to it?

1400
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:53,242
The m equals 0
state is the same.

1401
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:54,950
But then it breaks
up-- as everyone said,

1402
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:57,555
it breaks up into three lines
that are equally spaced.

1403
01:03:57,555 --> 01:04:01,260

1404
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,710
It breaks up into three
lines, because one of them

1405
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,750
has m which is plus 1, one
of them has m which is 0,

1406
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,540
and one is m is minus 1.

1407
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,770
So energies will
increase or decrease.

1408
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:14,170
Let's say this is frequency.

1409
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,290
So we get this splitting.

1410
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,460
And another way to draw
this is as a function of B,

1411
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,570
let's draw the energy levels.

1412
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,680
So there's the 1.

1413
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,150
There's the 0.

1414
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,960
And this stays constant.

1415
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,035
And these guys-- one is
constant, one increases,

1416
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:30,785
and one decreases.

1417
01:04:30,785 --> 01:04:34,006

1418
01:04:34,006 --> 01:04:36,130
When you start getting into
strong magnetic fields,

1419
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,025
weird things happen,
like these guys cross,

1420
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:40,930
and all sorts of subtle
things can happen.

1421
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:42,930
But let's ignore the
strong magnetic field case,

1422
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,010
and just focus on this.

1423
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,290
So we see that these guys split.

1424
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:51,690
So this is what the Schrodinger
theory, or the full story

1425
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,000
would predict-- it came
a little bit after this,

1426
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,097
but this experiment
was done in '96,

1427
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:59,680
so there's actually kind of an
entertaining story about people

1428
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,560
trying to explain this
effect classically.

1429
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,010
Well, look you could
have some angular

1430
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,445
momentum in the z
direction, some angular

1431
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:06,030
momentum in the x direction,
some angular momentum in the y

1432
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,810
direction.

1433
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,018
The part that has angular
momentum in the x direction

1434
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:11,170
doesn't do anything,
or in the z direction.

1435
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:12,795
The part with the x
and part with the y

1436
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:13,982
can have different polars.

1437
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:15,690
There's a whole
classical song and dance.

1438
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,290
It's crazy.

1439
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:17,230
It doesn't make any sense.

1440
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,980
But that's because they were
trying to classical mechanics

1441
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,840
to do quantum mechanics,
which doesn't work.

1442
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,180
So I'm not even going
to bother explaining

1443
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,180
what they were thinking.

1444
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:26,660
But anyway, so people came up
with a sort of classical crutch

1445
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,720
to say, well that's
not totally insane.

1446
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,870
So this is what Zeeman
got, for example,

1447
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,840
by looking at hydrogen.

1448
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,550
But he did more than
just look at hydrogen.

1449
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,385
I can't remember exactly-- I
think he did it with sodium.

1450
01:05:40,385 --> 01:05:42,010
Matt, do you remember?

1451
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,280
I think he did sodium and iron.

1452
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,755
But anyway, here's
the funny thing

1453
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,130
that he got with
sodium and iron.

1454
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,546
So this is a
different experiment.

1455
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:50,060
It's exactly the
same set up, but he

1456
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,030
was looking at spectral
lines in sodium.

1457
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:55,130
And spectral lines in sodium
did a very similar thing.

1458
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,450
There were some
where 1 went to 1.

1459
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:01,400

1460
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,520
And there were
others where 1 went

1461
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,546
to-- why did we have three here?

1462
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:10,920
Just as quick reminder, why
do we have three states here?

1463
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1464
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,840
PROFESSOR: Because we have
three states for l equals 1.

1465
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:25,600
This one state went to one,
two, three, four states,

1466
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,734
with none of them in the middle.

1467
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,150
And in fact, it's
worse than that,

1468
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,108
because they didn't go
to equally spaced states

1469
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:31,700
in general.

1470
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,650
In general, they did
something slightly funny.

1471
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,690
And the beautiful plot in
his paper looks like this.

1472
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:40,130

1473
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:44,410
There are four states, and as
you take the magnetic field

1474
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,230
to 0, these four states
all coalesce exactly

1475
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,064
to this one state.

1476
01:06:49,064 --> 01:06:51,355
So this one line is representing
four different states.

1477
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:54,000

1478
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,990
And this already included
the fine structure,

1479
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:00,535
so we know that this is
all a single value of l.

1480
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:02,035
But that apparently
has four states.

1481
01:07:02,035 --> 01:07:07,000

1482
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,810
That's should worry you.

1483
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,926
What does that tell you about l?

1484
01:07:12,926 --> 01:07:14,550
What does l have to
be in order to have

1485
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,444
four states in your tower?

1486
01:07:16,444 --> 01:07:17,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1487
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,600
PROFESSOR: Half integer--
in particular, what value?

1488
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,830
3/2, crap.

1489
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,790
We already know that
these wave functions

1490
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,090
are described by
the ylm's, right?

1491
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,600
We solved that problem.

1492
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,870
We explicitly solved it.

1493
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:30,920
Here's the exact answer.

1494
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,246
It's the ylm's.

1495
01:07:33,246 --> 01:07:34,620
But we've observed
experimentally

1496
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,210
that l has to be 3/2.

1497
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:40,347
But if l is 3/2,
ylm is equal to 0,

1498
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,805
because it's equal
to minus itself.

1499
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:45,070

1500
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,400
This is bad.

1501
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,860
This is 0.

1502
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,840
So this effect is called
the Zeeman effect,

1503
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,743
and this effect is called
the anomalous Zeeman effect.

1504
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:53,630
[LAUGHTER]

1505
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,300
Which is strange
for two reasons.

1506
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,258
The first reason it's
strange is they showed up

1507
01:07:57,258 --> 01:07:58,312
in the same paper.

1508
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,770
And the second thing is, OK,
you call it the Zeeman effect,

1509
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,110
because there's some
guy named Zeeman.

1510
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:06,009
Is there some guy
named Anomalous Zeeman?

1511
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:07,050
It's a very strange name.

1512
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,299
Anyway so this was called
the anomalous Zeeman effect,

1513
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:12,230
despite appearing in the same
paper, because it's weird.

1514
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,087
It was deeply
disconcerting to people.

1515
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:15,670
We now just call it
the Zeeman effect,

1516
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,964
but we have the bad habit--
for entertainment value--

1517
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:20,297
of referring to it still as
the anamolous Zeeman effect.

1518
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:23,292
I'm not the only one
responsible for that bad habit.

1519
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:25,750
I'm going to point out that at
the end of this paper-- it's

1520
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,500
a totally awesome
paper, by the way-- it's

1521
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,600
very readable and short--
he says-- I was looking

1522
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,399
at it last night-- it
says, quote possibly

1523
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:36,580
the observed phenomenon
will be regarded

1524
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,810
as nothing of any consequence.

1525
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:44,029
OK, so a few years later,
Pauli says the following--

1526
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:46,319
so Pauli says this,
actually, and this is also

1527
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,410
totally lovely in Science
from 1946 Pauli was in the US

1528
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,170
during the war.

1529
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,674
After the war, he was at the
Institute for Advanced Study.

1530
01:08:54,674 --> 01:08:57,090
At the Institute for Advanced
Studies, while he was there,

1531
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,439
he got the Nobel Prize.

1532
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:00,744
And he gave-- for the
exclusion principle, which

1533
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:02,910
we are about to get to--
and he gave a little spiel,

1534
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,310
and it's written up in
this edition of Science.

1535
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,040
And he says, quote,
a colleague who

1536
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,080
met me strolling
rather aimlessly

1537
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,000
in the beautiful
streets of Copenhagen

1538
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,010
said to me in a friendly
manner, "You look very unhappy."

1539
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:22,910
Whereupon, I responded fiercely,
"How can one look happy

1540
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,686
when he is thinking about
the anamolous Zeeman effect?"

1541
01:09:25,686 --> 01:09:32,500
[LAUGHTER]

1542
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,830
So this troubled people.

1543
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,374
Yeah.

1544
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:35,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1545
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:42,220

1546
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,389
PROFESSOR: Yeah he found
all sorts of crazy states.

1547
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,680
So this isn't the only example.

1548
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,388
It's just the only
one I'm going to draw.

1549
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:49,479
But indeed, you can
find five half states

1550
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:50,967
you can find states with six.

1551
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:52,050
AUDIENCE: Why [INAUDIBLE]?

1552
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:56,787

1553
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:58,620
PROFESSOR: Oh, I didn't
draw all the states.

1554
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,078
The spectrum is complicated
and messy, because it's sodium.

1555
01:10:01,078 --> 01:10:02,970
And so there's
all sorts of crap.

1556
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,570
So I'm just not drawing it.

1557
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:08,370
I'm just focusing on a
specific set of spectral lines.

1558
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:16,310
Maybe the best way
to draw that is-- OK.

1559
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:20,540
So this was really troubling.

1560
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,679
So let's put this on
pause for the moment,

1561
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,470
and we'll come back to
it in just a second.

1562
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:28,010
So meanwhile, there's
something else

1563
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,760
that's sort of annoying
about this system.

1564
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,097
We've got the Coulomb potential,
and the Coulomb potential

1565
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:35,680
has the following
beautiful property--

1566
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:41,710
the degeneracy of any energy
state is equal to n squared.

1567
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:44,410
Meanwhile, various
people were fond

1568
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:49,550
of observing the fact that
the number of states, which

1569
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,080
I will-- in an
abuse of language--

1570
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,080
call the degeneracy of the
level n in the periodic table,

1571
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,770
is equal to-- well, the
first one there's two.

1572
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,736
And then there's eight,
and then there's 18.

1573
01:11:01,736 --> 01:11:05,930

1574
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:13,180
So two, 8, 8, 18, that's
almost 2n squared.

1575
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,720

1576
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,040
Two four 8, 9, 18.

1577
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,870
Cool, maybe there's a
relationship, right?

1578
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:23,245
And meanwhile,
it's very tempting

1579
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,244
to think there's a
relationship, because imagine

1580
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:27,012
you have four electrons.

1581
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:28,970
If you have four electrons,
what you do you do?

1582
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,820
Well, you put an
electron here, and then

1583
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,730
you could put an
electron here, or you

1584
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,357
could put an other
electron here.

1585
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:36,440
You could also put another
electron here and here.

1586
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,356
Or you could put them
in any combination-- two

1587
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:40,410
here, put two here,
two here, one,

1588
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,450
one-- you could do all
sorts of stuff, right?

1589
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:45,990
But if, for the
moment, you imagine

1590
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,722
that electrons have
this funny property.

1591
01:11:47,722 --> 01:11:49,180
Imagine for a moment
that electrons

1592
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,430
have the property that they
can't be in the same state

1593
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,315
at once.

1594
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:54,440
Then if you have four
electrons-- I don't know why.

1595
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,130
I'm desperate.

1596
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,490
I'm thinking about the
anamolous Zeeman effect,

1597
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,040
among other things.

1598
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,206
I have nothing better to do.

1599
01:11:58,206 --> 01:12:00,560
So just for fun, let's imagine
if I put an elector here,

1600
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,560
I can't put another one.

1601
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,910
So if I have a
two electron atom,

1602
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,360
the second one goes
with one of these.

1603
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,300
A three-electron atom,
a four-electron atom,

1604
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,810
and these guys are all related
to each other, because they

1605
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,212
live in the same
energy level, but they

1606
01:12:09,212 --> 01:12:10,290
have different l
values, so they'll

1607
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,748
have slightly
different properties.

1608
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:14,950
That suggests that
the one l equals

1609
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:17,530
0 state should be different
from the 3 l equals 1 states,

1610
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,470
chemically.

1611
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,630
But wait-- there aren't
groupings of one and three.

1612
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,500
They're groupings
of two and six.

1613
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:32,802
Ah, two-- well, so Pauli
staring at this in 1925

1614
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:34,260
said the following--
he said, look,

1615
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,180
I'm going to
conjecture two things.

1616
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:41,000
The first is that
no two electrons

1617
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,190
can live in the same state--
inhabit the same quantum state.

1618
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:53,170

1619
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,570
That doesn't give us the
periodic table, though.

1620
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,060
It gives us half
the periodic table.

1621
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:12,240
There are twice as many states
in hydrogen as you think.

1622
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:15,126

1623
01:13:15,126 --> 01:13:17,000
And you might think that
I'm being facetious,

1624
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,315
that he said something a
little more sophisticated.

1625
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:20,190
But he really didn't.

1626
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:22,020
What he said is, I
posit of the existence

1627
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,060
of an additional quantum number
which the electron can have,

1628
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,840
which takes one of two values.

1629
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,460
Which translated, says, there
are twice as many states

1630
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,309
as you think.

1631
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:34,600
So that's exactly what he said.

1632
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,740
So this is called the
Pauli exclusion principle.

1633
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:40,262
And now this does a
totally spectacular thing--

1634
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:42,720
and you've probably all seen
this in high school chemistry,

1635
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,370
or even college chemistry.

1636
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,579
Now, first electron goes
here, second electron

1637
01:13:46,579 --> 01:13:48,620
goes here, because there
are twice as many states

1638
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,880
as you think, but then I can't
put another state in there,

1639
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,520
because that's as
many as you can have.

1640
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,690
One can go here, and you
can put up to six in here.

1641
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:56,340
And that's it.

1642
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,840
So the E2 states, the n squared,
which is 4 times 2 states,

1643
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,940
are somehow related to
each other naturally.

1644
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,920
And this gives you the
structure of the periodic table.

1645
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,336
In fact, an awful
lot of chemistry

1646
01:14:07,336 --> 01:14:08,480
follows directly from this.

1647
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,188
So this is the Pauli
exclusion principle.

1648
01:14:10,188 --> 01:14:12,430
However, it's a little
bit disappointing,

1649
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,980
because while this is
whatever-- some ridiculous rule,

1650
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,354
but we're doing
quantum mechanics

1651
01:14:16,354 --> 01:14:18,800
and they're all
ridiculous rules.

1652
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,730
On the other hand, this
one is just stupid.

1653
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:21,230
Right?

1654
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:24,890
This is just, like, look,
it wouldn't it be nice?

1655
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:31,520
So in '25, a couple guys--
really interesting characters--

1656
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,739
named Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck--
so Uhlenbeck-- wow,

1657
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,780
we're really low on time.

1658
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,100
OK, so I'll just tell
you this, and then I'll

1659
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,320
get to the last of it later.

1660
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,310
So Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck--
who were young, kind of naive--

1661
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,310
said, look we've got
two effects here.

1662
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,110
One effect is the
anamolous Zeeman effect,

1663
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:56,380
and there's this
weird fact that states

1664
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,335
have the wrong total
angular momentum.

1665
01:14:58,335 --> 01:15:00,460
And we have this second
thing, that there are twice

1666
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,250
as many states for
an electron as you

1667
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,410
think in the Coulomb potential.

1668
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,490
How can these two things
fit together naturally?

1669
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:10,060
Well here's a guess--
suppose that the angular

1670
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,390
momentum that we
calculated when we

1671
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:17,569
did the estimate of the braking
due to the Zeeman effect,

1672
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:19,860
suppose that angular momentum
was not the right angular

1673
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:20,310
momentum.

1674
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,130
Maybe there's more angular
momentum in the system.

1675
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:23,670
There's angular momentum in
the system from the electron

1676
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:25,878
orbiting around, but maybe
like a little, tiny Earth,

1677
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:28,180
the electron itself can
have some intrinsic angular

1678
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,347
momentum.

1679
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,180
It turns out Pauli had
had this idea before.

1680
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,640
In fact, Kramers
had suggested this

1681
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,800
to him, who was a very
young guy at the time.

1682
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,660
And Pauli said, you're
a blithering idiot,

1683
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,490
because if you calculate
how small an electron has

1684
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,410
to be in order to fit all the
other things we know, and you

1685
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,370
figure out how fast it would
have to rotate to explain

1686
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:44,840
the anamolous Zeeman
effect, the surface

1687
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,990
would have to be moving
faster the speed of light.

1688
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,110
That's ridiculous.

1689
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,630
Leave my office.

1690
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:58,750
So then Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit--
these two guys-- write a paper,

1691
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,440
and say aha!

1692
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,350
Well, we can explain
this, but let's just not

1693
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:02,980
assume that the stupid
thing is rotating.

1694
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,810
Let's just say an electron
has some intrinsic angular

1695
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,630
momentum.

1696
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:07,650
I don't know, why not?

1697
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,400
Electrons have intrinsic
angular momentum,

1698
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,370
and if you assume that electrons
have an intrinsic angular

1699
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:16,880
momentum-- which I'll call
S for the moment-- so then

1700
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,390
the total angular
momentum, j, is

1701
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,320
equal to l, its orbital
angular momentum,

1702
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,420
plus some intrinsic
angular momentum, which--

1703
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,795
I don't remember what symbol
they used, but we'll call it

1704
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:28,040
for the moment S-- where
this has the property that S

1705
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:34,480
squared, for an electron,
sorry, the principle quantum

1706
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,040
number, which I will call
little s is equal to 1/2,

1707
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,214
so m sub s is equal
to plus or minus 1/2.

1708
01:16:41,214 --> 01:16:43,505
So this is like the l equals
1/2 state, but it's not l.

1709
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:44,546
It's something intrinsic.

1710
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:46,730
It has nothing to do
with anything rotating.

1711
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,357
It's just a fact
about electrons.

1712
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:50,190
Suppose electrons have
a little bit of spin.

1713
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,390
Then what you discover is if
you have the l equals 1 state,

1714
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,280
and the electron
has spin 1/2, what's

1715
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,720
the total angular momentum?

1716
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,769
3/2, right?

1717
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:01,560
So what do you get?

1718
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,755
You get quadruplets, like that.

1719
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:07,630
So this turns out to
explain-- if you include

1720
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,463
a small relativistic
effect-- this turns out

1721
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:14,720
to explain the anomalous
Zeeman effect bang on.

1722
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,640
Meanwhile, there
was an experiment

1723
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,210
done in 1922, which is the
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

1724
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:23,080
in which Stern and Gerlach
discovered that nickel, when

1725
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,315
sent through a magnetic
field gradient,

1726
01:17:25,315 --> 01:17:28,600
bent into one of two
different spots-- never three,

1727
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,110
never zero, always two.

1728
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,040
How can that be?

1729
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,410
Electron spin-- that
wasn't realized until 1929,

1730
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,130
that the connection was there.

1731
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:41,870
So these guys came up with
this ridiculous postulate.

1732
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,560
This was Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit.

1733
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:49,460
And let me just quickly--
U-H-L-E-N-B-E-C-K--

1734
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,610
so Uhlenbeck-- amazing,
amazing scientist,

1735
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:55,390
also the father of the
mathematician Uhlenbeck,

1736
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,140
and she was a total badass,
and has inspired an awful lot

1737
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,259
of physics-- Karen
Uhlenbeck, who's at UT.

1738
01:18:02,259 --> 01:18:04,300
So this is a pretty
interesting and prolific guy.

1739
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,350
But he was also prolific
in the following way--

1740
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:10,540
he ran a program at the Rad
Lab at MIT during World War II.

1741
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,740
And Goudsmit worked with him.

1742
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,476
And when they were finishing
up, when the war was ending,

1743
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:17,600
Goudsmit became the scientific
adviser to something

1744
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,140
called Project Alsos.

1745
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,780
Project Alsos was a project
where the military went

1746
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,230
to the conquered
territories in Germany

1747
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:27,870
to catch the German
atomic scientists,

1748
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,710
and bring them to a
place called Farm Hall

1749
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:34,190
in England, where they listened
and eavesdropped on them--

1750
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:37,820
Heisenberg, all the good guys.

1751
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,420
Well, bad guys-- it depends
on-- all the great physicist

1752
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:42,000
in the German
territory at the time

1753
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,360
were deeply complicated people.

1754
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,500
And they listened to them.

1755
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,300
Something called the
Farm Hall Transcripts

1756
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,470
are the transcripts
of those recordings.

1757
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,684
They were written up in a book
called "The Epsilon Project,"

1758
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:54,350
which is totally
breathtakingly awesome.

1759
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:57,580
And Goudsmit wrote a
book called "Alsos"

1760
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,240
about this process of hunting
down the German scientists.

1761
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:07,390
So Goudsmit,
G-O-U-D-S-M-I-T, I think,

1762
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,900
he wrote a book called "Alsos",
which I heartily recommend

1763
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,530
to you, because it's like a
combination adventure story

1764
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:15,020
and beautiful bit
of physics history.

1765
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,020
So these guys both were at
MIT during the World War.

1766
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,720
So there's a nice
connection here.

1767
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,360
So these guys--
fascinating characters,

1768
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,050
and they came up with this
idea of some intrinsic angular

1769
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,740
momentum.

1770
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:27,926
Pauli then calls it spin.

1771
01:19:27,926 --> 01:19:28,800
He gives it the name.

1772
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,590
And he develops a
mathematical theory of spin.

1773
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,220
And the mathematical
theory of spin

1774
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,680
will lead to quantum field
theory, relativistic quantum

1775
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,380
mechanics, and will
eventually lead

1776
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,040
to quantum computation,
which is going

1777
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,074
to be the topic of the
last week of our course.

1778
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,490
So what we've done
so far is we've

1779
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:46,610
explained the discreteness
of atomic spectra,

1780
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,140
and we've explained
the structure

1781
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,422
of the periodic table.

1782
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:50,880
What we haven't
done, is we haven't

1783
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,200
explained why atoms form
molecules or solids.

1784
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,890
And we also haven't explained
what spin is at all.

1785
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,150
Those are the topics in
the next three weeks.

1786
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:01,110
See you next time.

1787
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:06,111
