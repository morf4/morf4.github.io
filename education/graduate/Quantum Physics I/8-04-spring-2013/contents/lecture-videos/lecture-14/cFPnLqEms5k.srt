00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:23,970

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,690
PROFESSOR: So today we're
going to do our last lecture

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,089
on scattering in 1D
quantum mechanics,

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,130
and we're going to introduce
some powerful ideas,

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,129
in particular, the phase
shift and the S matrix,

14
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:35,270
and they're cool.

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,570
We'll use them for good.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,660
Before we get started,
questions from last time?

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,424

18
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:45,340
AUDIENCE: What was the
music that was playing?

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,180
PROFESSOR: Just now?

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,820
It's a band called
Saint Germain.

21
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,280
It's actually a guy,
but he refers to himself

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,720
as a band called Saint Germain.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,200
Anyway, it's from an album
I think called "Traveler."

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,480
Physics questions?

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,530
Anyone?

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,817
OK, good.

27
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:06,650
Well, bad, actually.

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,316
I'd much prefer it
if you had questions,

29
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:11,296
but I'll take that as a sign
of knowledge, competence,

30
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:11,795
and mastery.

31
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:16,680

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,250
So last time, we
talked about scattering

33
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,870
past a barrier
with some height L

34
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,777
and some height V, which
I think we called V0,

35
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,860
and we observed a bunch
of nice things about this.

36
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,570
First off, we computed the
probability of transmission

37
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,400
across this barrier as a
function of the energy,

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,900
and it had a bunch
of nice features.

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,160
First off, it asymptoted
to 1 at high energies,

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,910
which makes sense.

41
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,700
Things shouldn't really care if
you have a little tiny barrier.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,215
It went to 0 at 0 energy.

43
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,894

44
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:49,560
I think we should all
find that obvious.

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,430
If you have
extremely low energy,

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,720
you're just going to bounce
off this very hard wall.

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
In between, though,
there's some structure.

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,950
In particular, at certain
values of the energy

49
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,540
corresponding to certain
values of the wave

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,280
number in the barrier region,
at certain values of the energy,

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,841
we saw that the
transmission was perfect.

52
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:07,340
Oops.

53
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,464
This should have been here.

54
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,740
Sorry.

55
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:18,220
The transition was perfect at
special values of the energy,

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,980
and that the reflection
at those points was 0.

57
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,260
You transmitted perfectly.

58
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,100
But meanwhile, the
reflection, which

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,360
is 1 minus the transmission,
hit maxima at special points,

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,740
and those special
points turn out

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,440
to be half integer shifted
away from the special points

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,875
for perfect transmission.

63
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,000
So at certain points, we
have perfect transmission.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,049
At certain points, we have
extremely efficient reflection.

65
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,590
One of our goals
today is going to be

66
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,430
to understand this physics,
the physics of resonance

67
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,667
in scattering off
of a potential.

68
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,000
So the asymptotes we understand.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,010
Classically, that makes sense.

70
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,259
Classically, that makes sense.

71
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,732
But classically, this is a
really weird structure to see.

72
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,690
And notice that it's also
not something that we

73
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,970
saw when we looked at
scattering off of a simple step.

74
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,130
When we looked at a
simple step, what we got

75
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,582
was something that looked
like 0 and then this.

76
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,540
There was no structure.

77
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,740
It was just a
nice, simple curve.

78
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,680
So something is
happening when we

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,352
have a barrier as
opposed to a step.

80
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:24,060
So our job is going
to be, in some sense,

81
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,590
to answer why are
they so different.

82
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,060
Before we get going, questions
about the step barrier.

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,680
Yeah?

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,408
AUDIENCE: That little line that
you drew over your other graph,

85
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:37,810
is that to scale?

86
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,310
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

87
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,212
This one?

88
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:43,570
AUDIENCE: No, the little line
that you drew right there.

89
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,530
PROFESSOR: This?

90
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,030
Sorry, I should
drawn it separately.

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,570
That was the transmission
as a function of energy

92
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,310
across a single step, and
so that looked like this.

93
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,937
AUDIENCE: So if we
were to overlap that

94
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,260
onto our resonance one--

95
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,051
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

96
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,150
AUDIENCE: Would
it [INAUDIBLE] to?

97
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,600
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

98
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,590
So I just meant to
compare the two.

99
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,923
I just wanted to think of
them as two different systems.

100
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:08,820
In this system, the transmission
curve is a nice, simple curve.

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,920
It has no structure.

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
In the case of a step barrier,
we get non-zero transmission

103
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,370
at low energies
instead of going to 0

104
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,431
and we get this
resonant structure.

105
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,514
So it's just for contrast.

106
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:22,540

107
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,460
Before going into
that in detail,

108
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,820
I want to do one slight
variation of this problem.

109
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm not going to do any
of the computations.

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,221
I'm just going to
tell you how to get

111
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,600
the answer from the answers
we've already computed.

112
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
So consider a square well.

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,015
You guys have solved
the finite square well

114
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,104
on your problem sets.

115
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,020
Consider a finite square
well again of width L

116
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,990
and of depth now minus V0.

117
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,030
It's the same thing
with V goes to minus V.

118
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,030
And again, I want to
consider scattering states.

119
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,480
So I want to consider states
with positive energy, energy

120
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,950
above the asymptotic potential.

121
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,530

122
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,270
Now, at this point, by now we
all know how to solve this.

123
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,755
We write plain waves
here, plain waves here,

124
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:00,880
and plain waves in between.

125
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,750
We solve the potential in each
region where it's constant,

126
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,392
and then we impose continuity
of the wave function

127
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,600
and continuity of the
derivative of the wave function

128
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,080
at the matching points.

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,580
So we know how to
solve this problem

130
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,890
and deduce the transmission
reflection coefficients.

131
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,890
We've done it for this
problem, and it's exactly

132
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,760
the same algebra.

133
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,712
And in fact, it's so
exactly the same algebra

134
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,670
that we can just take
the results from this one

135
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,840
and take V to minus V and
we'll get the right answer.

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,970
You kind of have to.

137
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:32,360
So if we do, what we get for
the transition probability--

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,920
and now this is the transmission
probability for a square well--

139
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,650
and again, I'm going to use the
same dimensionless constants.

140
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,530
g0 squared is equal to 2mL
squared over h bar squared

141
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,660
times V0.

142
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,180
This is 1 over an energy.

143
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,930
This is an energy.

144
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,960
This is dimensionless.

145
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,390
And the dimensionless energy
epsilon is equal to E over V.

146
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,580
To express my
transmission probability,

147
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,940
life is better when
it's dimensionless.

148
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,140
So T, the transmission
probability,

149
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,190
again, it's one of
these horrible 1 overs.

150
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:13,780
1 over 1 plus 1 over 4
epsilon, epsilon plus 1,

151
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,240
sine squared of g0, square
root of epsilon plus 1.

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,840

153
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,580
This is again the same.

154
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,081
You can see what we got last
time by now taking V to minus V

155
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:30,580
again.

156
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,160
That takes epsilon
to minus epsilon.

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,360
So we get epsilon, 1 minus
epsilon, or epsilon minus 1

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,894
picking up the minus
sign from this epsilon,

159
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:40,810
and here we get a 1 minus
epsilon instead of 1

160
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,450
plus epsilon.

161
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,390
That's precisely what
we got last time.

162
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,609
So if you're feeling punchy
at home tonight, check this.

163
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,400
In some sense, you're
going to re-derive it

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,486
on the problem set.

165
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:52,690

166
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,290
So it looks basically
the same as before.

167
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,480
We have a sine
function downstairs,

168
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,011
which again will sometimes be 0.

169
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,510
The sine will
occasionally be 0 when

170
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,250
its argument is
a multiple of pi.

171
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,290
And when that sine
function is 0,

172
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,940
then the transmission
probability is 1 over 1 plus 0.

173
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,880
It's also known as 1.

174
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,900
Transmission is perfect.

175
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,480
So we again get a
resonant structure,

176
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,900
and it's in fact exactly the
same plot, or almost exactly

177
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,100
the same plot.

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,885
I'm going to plot
transmission-- let's go ahead

179
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,090
and do this--
transmission probability

180
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,870
as a function, again, of
the dimensionless energy.

181
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:37,450
And what we get is, again,
not very well drawn resonances

182
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,720
where transmission
goes to 1 thanks

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,030
to my beautiful artistic skills.

184
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,690
Points where the reflection
hits a local maximum.

185
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,470

186
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,540
But we know one more
thing about this system,

187
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,930
which is that, in addition to
having scattering states whose

188
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,160
transition probability are
indicated by this plot,

189
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,480
we know we also have, for
negative energy, bound states.

190
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,910
Unlike the step barrier,
for the step well,

191
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,430
we also have bound states.

192
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,960
So here's the
transmission curve,

193
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,660
but I just want to remind
you that we have energies.

194
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,650
At special values of energies,
we also have bound states.

195
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,190
And precisely what
energies depends

196
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,260
on the structure of
the well and the depth,

197
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,240
but if the depth of the well
is, say, V0 so this is minus 1,

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,230
we know that the lowest
bound state is always

199
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,770
greater energy than
the bottom of the well.

200
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,320
Cool?

201
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,669
So epsilon, remember,
is E over V0,

202
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,289
and in the square
well of depth V0,

203
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,830
the lowest bound state cannot
possibly have energy lower than

204
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,299
the bottom of the well, so
its epsilon must have epsilon

205
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,864
greater than minus 1.

206
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:46,280
Anyway, this is
just to remind you

207
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,360
that there are bound states.

208
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,030
Think of this like
a gun put down

209
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,920
on a table in a play in Act One.

210
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,600

211
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,744
It's that dramatic.

212
00:08:58,744 --> 00:08:59,660
It will show up again.

213
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,677
It will come back and
play well with us.

214
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,260
I want to talk about
these resonances.

215
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,280
Let's understand
why they're there.

216
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,030
There are a bunch of
ways of understanding

217
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,770
why these resonances
are present, and let

218
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,040
me just give you a couple.

219
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,790
First, a heuristic
picture, and then I

220
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,560
want to give you a very precise
computational picture of why

221
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,300
these resonances are happening.

222
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,600
So the first is imagine
we have a state where

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
the transmission is perfect.

224
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,980
What that tells you is
KL is a multiple of pi.

225
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,520

226
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,060
If this is the
distance L of the well,

227
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,240
in here the wave is
exactly one period

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,960
if its KL is equal
to a multiple of pi.

229
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:47,150

230
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,810
Let me simplify my life and
consider the case KL is 2 pi.

231
00:09:49,810 --> 00:10:01,550

232
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,710
Sorry.

233
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,300
4 pi.

234
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,950
I switched notations for you.

235
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,120
I was using in my head, rather
in my notes, width of the well

236
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,070
is 2L for reasons
you'll see on the notes

237
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,380
if you look at the notes,
but let's ignore that.

238
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,820
Let's focus on these guys.

239
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,280
So consider the state,
configuration in energy,

240
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,020
such that in the well, we have
exactly one period of the wave

241
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,740
function.

242
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,780
That means that the value of the
wave function at the two ends

243
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,400
is the same and the
slope is the same.

244
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,420
So whatever the
energy is out here,

245
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,820
if it matches smoothly
and continuously

246
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,485
and its derivative is continuous
here, it will match smoothly

247
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:49,480
and continuously out here as
well with the same amplitude

248
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,954
and the same period
inside and outside.

249
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,120
The amplitude is the same
and the phase is the same.

250
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,161
That means this wave must
have the same amplitude

251
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,700
and the same period.

252
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,210
It has to have the same period
because it's the same energy,

253
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,460
but it must have the same
amplitude and the same slope

254
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,100
at that point.

255
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,450
And that means
that this wave has

256
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,280
the same amplitude as this wave.

257
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,449
The norm squared is the
transmission probability,

258
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,990
the norm squared of this divided
by the norm squared of this.

259
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,430
That means the transmission
probability has to be 1.

260
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,730
What would have
happened had the system,

261
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,899
instead of being perfectly
periodic inside the well--

262
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,190
actually, let me leave that up.

263
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,207

264
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,040
Let's do it as this.

265
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,501

266
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:37,000
Shoot.

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,208
I'm even getting my qualitative
wave functions wrong.

268
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,970
Let's try this again.

269
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,710
Start at the top,
go down, and then

270
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,367
its deeper inside the well
so the amplitude out here,

271
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,950
the difference in energy between
the energy and the potential,

272
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,390
is less, which means
the period is longer

273
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,176
and the amplitude is greater.

274
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:58,300
The way I've drawn it, it's
got a particular value.

275
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:07,510
It's got zero derivative
at this point,

276
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,547
so it's got to-- so
there's our wave function.

277
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,380
Same thing out here.

278
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,162

279
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:21,870
The important thing
is the amplitude here

280
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,328
has to be the same
as the amplitude

281
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,080
here because the amplitude and
the amplitude and the phase

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,760
were exactly as if there had
been no intervening region.

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,670
Everyone agree with that?

284
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,280
By contrast, if we had
looked at a situation where

285
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,080
inside the well, it was not the
same amplitude, so for example,

286
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,780
something like this, came
up with some slope which

287
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,750
is different and a value
which is different,

288
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,820
then this is going to match onto
something with the same period

289
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,165
but with a different amplitude
than it would have over here.

290
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:56,015

291
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:57,890
Same period because it's
got the same energy,

292
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,680
but a different
amplitude because it

293
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,810
has to match on with the
value and the derivative.

294
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,850
So you can think through
this and pretty quickly

295
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,790
convince yourself of the
necessity of the transmission

296
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,050
aptitude being 1 if this
is exactly periodic.

297
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,220
Again, if this is exactly
one period inside,

298
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,770
you can just
imagine this is gone

299
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,450
and you get a continuous
wave function,

300
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,908
so the amplitude
and the derivative

301
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:22,701
must be the same
on both sides as

302
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,950
if there was no barrier there.

303
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,110

304
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,660
When the wave function
doesn't have exactly one

305
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,620
period inside the well,
you can't do that,

306
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,120
so the amplitudes can't
be the same on both sides.

307
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,996
But that's not a very
satisfying explanation.

308
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,828
That's really an
explanation about solutions

309
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,110
to the differential equation.

310
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,609
I'm just telling you properties
of second order differential

311
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:45,120
equations.

312
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,440
Let's think of a
more physical, more

313
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,731
quantum mechanical explanation.

314
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:50,360
Why are we getting
these resonances?

315
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,500
Well, I want to think
about this in the same way

316
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,070
as we thought about the boxes
in the very first lecture.

317
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,740

318
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,620
Suppose we have
this square well,

319
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,889
and I know I have
some amplitude here.

320
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:07,930
I've got a wave function.

321
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,157
It's got some amplitude here.

322
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:10,740
It's got some momentum
going this way,

323
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,160
some positive momentum.

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,770
And I want to ask, what's the
probability that I will scatter

325
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
past the potential, let's
say to this point right here

326
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,686
just on the other
side of the potential?

327
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:22,849
What's the probability
that I will scatter across?

328
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,640
Well, you say, we've
done this calculation.

329
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,000
We know the probability to
transmit across this step

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,870
potential.

331
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,520
We did that last time.

332
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,710
So that's T step.

333
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,410

334
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,170
We know the probability
of scattering

335
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,134
across this potential step,
and that's transmission up.

336
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,550
And so the probability that
you transmit from here to here

337
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,883
is the probability that you
transmit here first and then

338
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:51,090
the probability that
you transmit here,

339
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,757
the product of
the probabilities.

340
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:53,465
Sound reasonable?

341
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:56,491

342
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:56,990
Let's vote.

343
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,700
How many people think that this
is equal to the transmission

344
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,170
probability across
the potential well?

345
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,047
Any votes?

346
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,630
You have to vote one
way or the other.

347
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,370
No, it is not.

348
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,000
How many people vote?

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,500
OK.

350
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Yes, it is.

351
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,000
OK.

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,950
The no's have it, and
that's not terribly

353
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,660
surprising because, of course,
these have no resonance

354
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,035
structure, so
where did that come

355
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,080
from if it's just
that thing squared?

356
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,440
So that probably can't be it,
but here's the bigger problem.

357
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,910
Why is this the wrong argument?

358
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,379

359
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,920
AUDIENCE: Because
there's reflection.

360
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,640
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

361
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,810
There's reflection, but that's
only one step in the answer

362
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,018
or why it's the wrong answer.

363
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,007
Why else?

364
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,590
AUDIENCE: Your
transmission operations

365
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,197
have to do it far away?

366
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,530
PROFESSOR: That's, true but
I just want the probability,

367
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,280
and if I got here with
positive momentum,

368
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,113
I'm eventually going
to get out to infinity,

369
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:45,080
so it's the same
probability because it's

370
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,330
just an E to the ikx out here.

371
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,300
The wave function
is just E to the ikx

372
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,490
so the probability is
going to be the same.

373
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,439
Other reasons?

374
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,772
AUDIENCE: Well, the width of
the well is very important,

375
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,272
but the first
argument ignores that.

376
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:58,063
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

377
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,090
That's also true.

378
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,673
So far, the reasons we have are
we need the width of the well,

379
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,120
doesn't appear.

380
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,405
That seems probably wrong.

381
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:07,024

382
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,440
The second is it's possible
that you could have reflected.

383
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,898
We haven't really
incorporated that

384
00:16:10,898 --> 00:16:12,480
in any sort of elegant way.

385
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,420
AUDIENCE: There are
other ways to transmit

386
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,905
by reflecting twice.

387
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,130
PROFESSOR: That's
absolutely true.

388
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,160
There are other
ways to transmit,

389
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
so you could transmit,
then you could reflect.

390
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,581
So we could transmit then
reflect, and reflect again,

391
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,330
and then transmit.

392
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,190
We could transmit,
reflect, reflect, transmit.

393
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,170
What else?

394
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,590
Do probabilities add
in quantum mechanics?

395
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,929

396
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,470
And when you have
products of events,

397
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,470
do probabilities multiply?

398
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,210
What adds in quantum mechanics?

399
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,479
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

400
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,520
PROFESSOR: The amplitude.

401
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,740
The wave function.

402
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,520
We do not take the
product of probabilities.

403
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,410
What we do is we ask,
what's the amplitude

404
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,237
to get here from
there, and we take

405
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,320
the amplitude norm squared
to get the probability.

406
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,290

407
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,830
So the correct
question is what's

408
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,099
the amplitude to get
from here to here?

409
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,890
How does the wave
function of the amplitude

410
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,610
change as you move
from here to here?

411
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,534
And for that, think back
to the two slit experiment

412
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,160
or think back to the boxes.

413
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,134
We asked the following question.

414
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:15,069
The amplitude that you should
transmit across this well

415
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,740
has a bunch of components,
is a sum of a bunch of terms.

416
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,564
You could transmit
down this well.

417
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,230
Inside here, you know
your wave function

418
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,910
is e to the i k prime L-- or
I think I'm calling this k2 x.

419
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,220
And in moving across the
well, your wave function

420
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,850
evolves by an e to the
i k2 L, and then you

421
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,010
could transmit again with
some transmission amplitude.

422
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,800
So this would be the
transmission down times e

423
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,114
to the i k2 L times
the transmit up.

424
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,780
As we saw last time,
these are the same,

425
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,900
but I just want to
keep them separate

426
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,520
so you know which
one talking about.

427
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,330
This is a contribution.

428
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,360
This is something that could
contribute to the amplitude.

429
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,790
Is it the only thing that could
contribute to the amplitude?

430
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,289
No.

431
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,590
What else could contribute?

432
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,450
Bounce, right?

433
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,120
So to get from here, to here
I could transmit, evolve,

434
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,030
transmit.

435
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,280
I could also transmit,
evolve, reflect, evolve,

436
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,840
reflect, evolve, transmit.

437
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,490
So there's also a term
that's t, e to the ikL, r,

438
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,030
e to the minus ikL,
r, e to the iKL.

439
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,697

440
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,280
Sorry, e to the plus
ikL because we're

441
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,509
increasing the
evolution of the phase.

442
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,050
And then transmit
finally at the end.

443
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,060

444
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,370
And these k's are
all k2, but I could

445
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,242
have done that many times.

446
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:43,450
But notice that each time
what I'm going to do is I'm

447
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,110
going to transmit, reflect,
reflect, transmit or transmit,

448
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,950
reflect, reflect, reflect,
reflect, transmit.

449
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:58,890
So I'm always going to do
this some number of times.

450
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,420
I do this once, I do this
twice, I do it thrice.

451
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,080
This gives me a
geometric series.

452
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:09,560
This is t e to
the i k2 L t times

453
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,370
1 plus this quantity plus
this quantity squared.

454
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,900
That's a geometric series,
1 over 1 plus this quantity

455
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,610
squared.

456
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,017
Sorry, 1 minus because
it's a geometric sum.

457
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,100
And what is this quantity?

458
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Well, it's r squared,
and remember the r's

459
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,733
in both directions are
the same, so I'm just

460
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:30,452
going to write it as
r squared e to the 2i.

461
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,826

462
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:34,686
r squared.

463
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:36,060
It's a real number,
but I'm going

464
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,259
to put the absolute
value on anyway.

465
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,550
It's going to simplify my life.

466
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:47,750
e to the 2i k2 L. So
this is our prediction

467
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,002
from multiple bounces.

468
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,960
What we're doing here is
we're taking seriously

469
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,870
the superposition principle that
says given any process, any way

470
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,440
that that process could happen,
you sum up the amplitudes

471
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,106
and the probability
is the norm squared.

472
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,100
If we have a source
and we have two slits

473
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,226
and I ask you, what's the
probability that you land here,

474
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,350
the probability is not the
sum of the probabilities

475
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,690
for each individual transit.

476
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,230
The probability is the
square of the amplitude where

477
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,710
the amplitude is the
sum, amplitude top

478
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,730
plus amplitude bottom.

479
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,395
Here, there are
many, many slits.

480
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,420
There are many different
ways this could happen.

481
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,345
You could reflect
multiple times.

482
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,809
Everyone cool with that?

483
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,350
By the same token,
we could have done

484
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,780
the same thing for
reflection, but let's stick

485
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,154
with transmission
for the moment.

486
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,930
This is what we get
for the transmission,

487
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,800
and again, the transmission
amplitudes across the step,

488
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,470
as we saw last
time, are the same.

489
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,855
So this is, in fact, t squared.

490
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:42,720

491
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,590
And this gives us a result for
transmission down the potential

492
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:58,930
well, and if we use what the
reflection and transmission

493
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,290
amplitudes were
for our step wells,

494
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:10,040
the answer that this gives is
1 over e to the i k2 L minus 2i

495
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:19,390
upon the transmission for
a step times sine of k2 L.

496
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,799
Now, this isn't the
same as the probability

497
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,340
that we derived over
here, but that's

498
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,440
because this isn't
the probability.

499
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,398
This was the amplitude.

500
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:30,030
We just computed
the total amplitude.

501
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,920
To get the probability,
we have to take

502
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,300
the norm squared
of the amplitude.

503
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,175
And when we take
the norm squared,

504
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:43,940
what we get is 1 upon 1 plus 1
over 4 epsilon, epsilon plus 1,

505
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,170
sine squared of g0
root epsilon plus 1.

506
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,892

507
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:53,850
We get the same answer.

508
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,317

509
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,310
AUDIENCE: Is that an equality?

510
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,480
PROFESSOR: This is an equality.

511
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,010
Oh, sorry.

512
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,530

513
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,297
Thank you, Barton.

514
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,880
We get to the
transmission probability

515
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,230
when we take the norm
squared of the amplitude.

516
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:13,860
Thank you.

517
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,050
Is equal to this, which is
the same as we got before.

518
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,550
Thanks.

519
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,280

520
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,445
Yeah, please?

521
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:25,770
AUDIENCE: Tell me why kL
equals pi doesn't work.

522
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,269

523
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,810
PROFESSOR: kL equals
pi doesn't work.

524
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,350
It does.

525
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,891
You just have to be
careful what kL--

526
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,554

527
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,012
AUDIENCE: On the
first drawing, you

528
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:38,678
changed your kL [INAUDIBLE].

529
00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:43,247

530
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,580
PROFESSOR: Because I'm an idiot.

531
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,810
Because I got a
factor of 2 wrong.

532
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,309
Thank you.

533
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:52,280

534
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,200
Thank you, Matt.

535
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,750
Thank you.

536
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,422
Answer analysis.

537
00:22:58,422 --> 00:22:59,380
It's a wonderful thing.

538
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:06,800

539
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,140
This does something
really nice for us.

540
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,230
Why are we getting a
resonance at special values

541
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,630
at the energy?

542
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,890
What's happening?

543
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,090
Well, in this quantum
mechanical process

544
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,250
of multiple interactions,
multiple scatterings,

545
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,659
there are many terms in the
amplitude for transmitting.

546
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,450
There are terms that
involve no reflection,

547
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,425
there are terms that
involve two reflections,

548
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:36,570
there are terms that
involve four reflections,

549
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,170
and they all come with an
actual magnitude and a phase.

550
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:47,270
And when the phase is the
same, they add constructively,

551
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,200
and when the phases are not
the same, they interfere.

552
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,850
And when the phases
are exactly off,

553
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,500
they interfere
destructively, and that

554
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,980
is why you're
getting a resonance.

555
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,760
Multiple terms in
your superposition

556
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,620
interfere with each
other, something

557
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,060
that does not
happen classically.

558
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,120
Classically, the
probabilities are products.

559
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
Quantum mechanically,
we have superposition

560
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,110
and probabilities are the
squares of the amplitude,

561
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,630
and we get interference
effects in the probabilities.

562
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,590
Cool?

563
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,530
To me, this is a nice, glorious
version of the two slit

564
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,260
experiment, and we're going
to bump up again into it later

565
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,610
when we talk about the physics
of solids in the real world.

566
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,870
Questions at this point?

567
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,689
Yeah?

568
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,730
AUDIENCE: Question on
something you said earlier.

569
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,399
What is the k2 L
equals [INAUDIBLE]?

570
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:40,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what's
special about that?

571
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:46,660
What's special about that is at
this point, where kL is n pi,

572
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,670
we get perfect transmission.

573
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,200
When kL is equal
to n plus 1/2 pi,

574
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,054
the reflection is
as good as it gets.

575
00:24:55,054 --> 00:24:56,720
What that's really
doing is it's saying,

576
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,550
when is this locally largest?

577
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,324
So that's the special
points when the transmission

578
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:05,740
is as small as possible, which
means the reflection, which

579
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,406
is 1 minus the
transmission probability,

580
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,620
is as large as possible.

581
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,659
And you can get that, again,
from these expressions.

582
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:14,325
Other questions?

583
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:28,790

584
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,780
So I want to think a little more
about these square barriers.

585
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,080
And in particular, in
thinking about the square well

586
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,360
barrier, what we've
been talking about

587
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,650
all along are
monochromatic wave packets.

588
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,180
We've been talking about
plain waves, just simply

589
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,990
e to the ikx, but you
can't put a single particle

590
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,630
in a state which
is a plain wave.

591
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,710
It's not normalizable.

592
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,490
What we really mean
at the end of the day

593
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,198
when we talk about
single particles is we

594
00:25:57,198 --> 00:26:00,940
put them in some well localized
wave packet, which at time 0,

595
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,200
let's say, is at position x0,
which in this case is negative,

596
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,840
and which has some well
defined average momentum, k0.

597
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,340
I'll say it's the expectation
value of momentum in this wave

598
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,077
packet.

599
00:26:14,077 --> 00:26:15,660
And the question we
really want to ask

600
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,970
when we talk about scattering
is, what happens to this beast

601
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,310
as it hits the
barrier, which I'm

602
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,810
going to put the
left hand side at 0

603
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,170
and the right hand
side at L and let

604
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,810
the depth be minus v0 again.

605
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,740
What happens as this incident
wave packet hits the barrier

606
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,859
and then scatters off?

607
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,150
Well, we know what would
happen if it was a plain wave,

608
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,520
but a plain wave
wouldn't be localized.

609
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,160
So this is the
question I want to ask,

610
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,530
and I want to use the
results that we already have.

611
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,750
Now, here's the key thing.

612
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,490

613
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,100
Consider to begin
with just a wave

614
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,890
packet for a free
particle centered

615
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:58,520
at x0 and with momentum k0,
just look for a free particle.

616
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,350
We know how to write this.

617
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,980
We can put the
system, for example,

618
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,650
we can take our wave
function at time 0

619
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,560
to be a Gaussian, some
normalization times

620
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,270
e to the minus x minus x0
squared over 2a squared.

621
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,309
And we want to give
it some momentum k0,

622
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,600
and you know how to do that
after the last problem set,

623
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,066
e to the i k0 x.

624
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:22,830
Everyone cool with that?

625
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,995
So there's our
initial wave function,

626
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,870
and we want to know how
it evolves with time,

627
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,130
and we know how to do that.

628
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,930
To evolve it in time,
we first expand it

629
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,820
in energy eigenstates.

630
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:39,260
So psi of x0 is equal to--
well, the energy eigenstates

631
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,150
in this case are plain waves,
dk e to the ikx over root 2 pi

632
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,990
times some coefficients, f of
k, the expansion coefficients.

633
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,400
But these are just
the Fourier transform

634
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,550
of our initial
Gaussian wave packet,

635
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:02,740
and we know what the form
of f of k is equal to.

636
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,560
Well, it's a Gaussian
of width 1 upon alpha

637
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,130
e to the minus k minus k0
because it has momentum k0,

638
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,460
so it's centered around k0,
squared over 2 times a squared,

639
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,310
and the a goes upstairs.

640
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,700
And the position of
the initial wave packet

641
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
is encoded in the
Fourier transform,

642
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,050
and I'm going to put
a normalization here,

643
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,560
which I'm not going to worry
about, with an overall phase

644
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,900
e to the minus ik x0.

645
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,360
So in just the same say
that adding on a phase,

646
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,667
e to the i k0 x, in
the position space

647
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:39,250
wave function tells you what the
expectation value of momentum

648
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,285
is, tacking on the phase--
and we can get this

649
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:43,368
from just Fourier transform--
tacking on the phase

650
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:45,470
e to the ik x0 in
the Fourier transform

651
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,210
tells you the center point,
the central position,

652
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,292
of the wave packet.

653
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,750
So this you did on
the problem set,

654
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,650
and this is a trivial
momentum space

655
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,170
version of the same thing.

656
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,890
So here's our wave
packet expanded

657
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,890
in plain waves, which
are energy eigenstates.

658
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,015
And the statement that
these are energy eigenstates

659
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,650
is equivalent to the statement
that under time evolution,

660
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,207
they do nothing but
rotate by a phase.

661
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,165
So if we want to know
what the wave function is

662
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:12,540
as a function of time, psi of x
and t is equal to the integral,

663
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,470
dk, the Fourier mode f of k.

664
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,052
I'll write it out.

665
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,610
Actually, I'm going to
write this out explicitly.

666
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:28,540
f of k 1 over root
2 pi e to the ikx

667
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,410
minus omega t where omega, of
course, is a function of t.

668
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:39,750
It's a free particle, so
for our free particle,

669
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:45,462
h bar squared k squared upon
2m is equal to h bar omega.

670
00:29:45,462 --> 00:29:48,410

671
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,300
We've done this before.

672
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,680
But now what I want to do
is I want to take exactly

673
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,910
the same system and I
want to add, at position

674
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,120
zero, a well of
depth v0 and width L.

675
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,553
How is our story
going to change?

676
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,886
Well, we want our initial
wave packet, which is up to us

677
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:08,330
to choose, we want our initial
wave packet to be the same.

678
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,871
We want to start
with a Gaussian far,

679
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:12,359
far, far away from the barrier.

680
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,150
We want it to be well
localized in position

681
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,090
and well localized in momentum
space, not perfectly localized,

682
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,659
of course.

683
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,700
It's a finite Gaussian to
satisfy the uncertainty

684
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,520
principle, but it's
well localized.

685
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,096
So how does this story change?

686
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,470
Well, this doesn't
change at all.

687
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,080
It's the same wave function.

688
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,980
However, when we expand
in energy eigenstates,

689
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:37,350
the energy eigenstates are
no longer simple plain waves.

690
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,600
The energy eigenstates,
as we know for the system,

691
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,570
take a different form.

692
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,990
For the square well and positive
energy scattering states,

693
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,170
the plain wave, or the
energy eigenstates,

694
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,470
which I will label by k, just
because I'm going to call e

695
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,121
is equal to h bar squared
k squared upon 2m--

696
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,620
the energy is a constant-- which
is the k asymptotically far

697
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
away from the potential.

698
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,850

699
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:12,050
The wave function I can write
as 1 over root 2 pi times

700
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:16,300
e to the ikx when we're
on the left hand side,

701
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,920
but being on the left hand side
is equivalent to multiplying

702
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,870
by a theta function of minus x.

703
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,750
This is the function which is
0 when its argument is negative

704
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,350
and 1 when its
argument is positive.

705
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,530

706
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,930
Plus we have the
reflected term, which

707
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,680
has an amplitude, r, which
is again a function of k.

708
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,250
This is the
reflection amplitude,

709
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,850
also known as c upon a.

710
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,020
e to the minus ikx-- again,
on the left hand side--

711
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,980
theta of minus x plus a
transition amplitude whose

712
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,070
norm squared is transmission
probability e to the ikx when

713
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,470
we're on the right, theta of x.

714
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,280

715
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,930
So this is just a slightly
different notation

716
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,810
than what we usually write
with left and right separated.

717
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:17,950

718
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,565
So what we want to do now is
we want to decompose our wave

719
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,690
function in terms of the
actual energy eigenstates.

720
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,440

721
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,860
The way we're going to do that,
and having done that, having

722
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,275
expanded our wave
function in this basis,

723
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,650
we can determine the time
evolution in the following way.

724
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,420
First, we expand
the wave function

725
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,230
at time 0 as an
integral, dk, and I'm

726
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,176
going to pull the root 2 pi out.

727
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,880

728
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,340
And we have some
Fourier transform,

729
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,890
which I'm now going
to call f tilde

730
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,223
because is slightly different
than the f we used before,

731
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:01,500
but it's what the expansion
coefficients have to be,

732
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:11,260
f tilde of k times
this beast, phi of k.

733
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:24,745

734
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,120
Let me actually
take this product

735
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,995
and write it out in
terms of the three terms.

736
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:33,680
So those three terms are going
to be f of k, again tilde,

737
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:43,340
e to the ikx, theta of minus x,
plus f tilde r e to the minus

738
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:53,272
ikx, theta of minus
x plus f tilde t

739
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:57,100
e to the ikx, theta of x.

740
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,490

741
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,590
Let's look at these terms.

742
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,510

743
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,639
Finally, we want to look
at the time evolution,

744
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,300
but we started out as a
superposition of states

745
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,159
with definite
energy labeled by k,

746
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,346
so we know the time evolution
is e to the ikx minus omega t, e

747
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:22,000
to the i minus ikx plus
omega t, so minus omega t,

748
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,130
and kx minus omega t.

749
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,310
So we can immediately, from this
time evolving wave function,

750
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,699
identify these
two terms as terms

751
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,350
with a central peak
moving to the right,

752
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,588
and this, central peak moving
to the left, kx plus omega t.

753
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:40,040

754
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Everyone cool with that?

755
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,530

756
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,030
Questions?

757
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,326

758
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,826
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain real quick

759
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:53,666
one more time how
that's the [INAUDIBLE]?

760
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,290
PROFESSOR: How that--
sorry, say again.

761
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,166
AUDIENCE: How the top
equation [INAUDIBLE].

762
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,450
PROFESSOR: How the top
equation led to this,

763
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,697
or just where this came from?

764
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:02,950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

765
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,800
PROFESSOR: Good.

766
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,710
This is just a notational thing.

767
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,900
Usually when I say phi sub
k is equal to, on the left,

768
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,560
e to the ikx with some
overall amplitude.

769
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,870
Let's say 1 over
2 pi e to the ikx

770
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:28,040
plus c over a e to the
minus ikx on the left,

771
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,770
and because this is
the reflected wave,

772
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,460
I'm just going to call this
R. And then on the right,

773
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,099
we have e to the ikx.

774
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,890
There's only a wave
travelling to the right

775
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,162
and the coefficient is the
transmission amplitude.

776
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:44,120
So this is what we normally
write, but then I'm

777
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,760
using the so-called
theta function.

778
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,500
Theta of x is defined as 0
when x is less than 0 and 1

779
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,680
when x is greater than 0.

780
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,520
This is a function 1.

781
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,310
Using theta function
allows me to write

782
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,510
this thing as a single
function without having

783
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,490
to goose around
with lots of terms.

784
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,440
Is that cool?

785
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,035
Great.

786
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,460
AUDIENCE: Are we just
thinking about one

787
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,612
step here or the whole
well, because always, we

788
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:11,320
should have something
[INAUDIBLE].

789
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,900
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

790
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,640
Excellent, excellent.

791
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,390
Thank you so much.

792
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,180

793
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,130
What I want to do is I want
to think of the wave function.

794
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,539
This is a good description when
the particle is far, far away,

795
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:24,830
and this is a good description
when the particle is not

796
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,240
in the potential.

797
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,740
Sorry.

798
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,050
Thank you.

799
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,520
I totally glossed
over this step.

800
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,860
I want to imagine
this as a potential

801
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:40,422
where all of the matching is
implemented at x equals 0,

802
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:41,880
so when I write it
in this fashion.

803
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,816

804
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:46,565
Another equivalent way
to think about this

805
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:48,648
is this is a good description
of the wave function

806
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:49,940
when we're not inside the well.

807
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,273
So for the purposes of the
rest of the analysis that I'm

808
00:36:52,273 --> 00:36:53,970
going to do, this
is exactly what

809
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,010
the form of the wave function is
when we're not inside the well,

810
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,060
and then let's just
not use this to ask

811
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,380
about questions inside the well.

812
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,849
When I write it in
this theta form,

813
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,890
or for that matter, when
I write it in this form,

814
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,130
this is not the form.

815
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,780
What I mean is left of the
well and right of the well,

816
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:20,180
and inside-- t e to
the ikx-- inside,

817
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,789
it's doing something
else, but we

818
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:25,330
don't want to ask
questions about it.

819
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,080

820
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,140
That's just going
to simplify my life.

821
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,810
Yeah?

822
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,250
AUDIENCE: And is
the lowercase t then

823
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,977
just the square
root of capital T?

824
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:37,810
PROFESSOR: It's the
square root of capital T

825
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,060
but you've got to be careful
because there can be a phase.

826
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,185
Remember, this is the
amplitude, and what it really

827
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:45,430
is is this reflection
is B over A,

828
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,240
and these guys are
complex numbers.

829
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,990
And it's true that B
over A norm squared

830
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,660
is the transmission
probability, but B over A

831
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,090
has a phase, and that
quantity I'm going to call t,

832
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,500
and we'll interpret that in
more detail in a few minutes.

833
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,610

834
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,520
So it's of this form.

835
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,420
I just want to look at
each of these three terms.

836
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,040
In particular, I want to
focus on them at time 0.

837
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,380
So at t equals 0, what
does this look like?

838
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,740
Well, that first term
is integral dk of f of k

839
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:25,630
e to the ikx minus omega
t, theta of minus x.

840
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,065
Notice that theta of minus
x is independent of k.

841
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:29,440
It's independent
of the integral,

842
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,930
so this is just a function
times theta of minus x.

843
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,917
And this function
was constructed

844
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,250
to give us the initial Gaussian.

845
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,210

846
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,650
And this was at t equals 0.

847
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:49,090
So this is just our Gaussian
at position x0 centered

848
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:55,292
around value k0 at time
equals 0, theta of minus x.

849
00:38:55,292 --> 00:39:01,555

850
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:07,830
Sorry, at position x0.

851
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,880
All this function is, this
is the Fourier transform

852
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,270
of our Gaussian and we're
undoing the Fourier transform.

853
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,090
This is just giving
us our Gaussian back.

854
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,830
And as long as the particle
is far away from the well--

855
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,992
so here's the well and
here's our wave packet--

856
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,700
that theta function
is totally irrelevant

857
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,272
because the Gaussian makes
it 0 away from the center

858
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:27,230
of the Gaussian anyway.

859
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:34,800

860
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,520
And so just as a
quick question, if we

861
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,260
look at this is a function of
t so we put back in the minus

862
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:49,760
omega t, so if we put back
in the time dependence,

863
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,870
this is a wave that's
moving to the right,

864
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,705
and to be more
precise about that,

865
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:57,080
what does it mean to say it's
a wave moving to the right?

866
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,700
Well, this is an envelope
on this set of plain waves,

867
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,890
and the envelope,
by construction,

868
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,770
was well localized
around position x

869
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,994
but it was also well
localized in momentum,

870
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,660
and in particular,
the Fourier transform

871
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,130
is well localized
around the momentum k0.

872
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,930

873
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,370
And so using the method
of stationary phase,

874
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:27,660
or just asking, where is the
phase constant stationary,

875
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,440
we get that the central
peak of the wave function

876
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,890
satisfies the equation d d k0.

877
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,940
If you're not familiar
with stationary phase,

878
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,240
let the recitation
instructors know

879
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,110
and they will
discuss it for you.

880
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,890
The points of stationary
phase of this superposition

881
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:58,690
of this wave packet lie
at the position d dk of kx

882
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,930
minus omega of kt
evaluated at the peak, k0,

883
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,530
of the distribution.

884
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,860
But d dk of kx minus omega
t is, for the first term x,

885
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,350
and for the second
term, d dk of omega.

886
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,650
Well, we know that omega, we're
in the free particle regime.

887
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,490
Omega, we all know what it is.

888
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,952
It's h bar k squared upon 2m.

889
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:23,660
We take the derivative
with respect to k.

890
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,300
We get h bar k over m.

891
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:32,860
The 2's cancel, so x
minus h bar k over m t.

892
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,140
And a place where
this phase is 0,

893
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,920
where the phase is
stationary, moves over time

894
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,190
as x is equal to
h bar k over m t.

895
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,880
But h bar k over m,
that's the momentum.

896
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,930
p over m, that's the
classical velocity.

897
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,140
So this is v0 t, the velocity
associated with that momentum.

898
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,919
So this is good.

899
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,210
We've done the right job of
setting up our wave packet.

900
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,120
We built a Gaussian
that was far away that

901
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,794
was moving in with a fixed
velocity towards the barrier,

902
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:08,210
and now we want to know what
happens after it collides off

903
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,300
the barrier.

904
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,012
Cool?

905
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,970
So what we really want
to ask is at late times,

906
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,553
what does the wave
function look like?

907
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:15,794

908
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,460
Again, we're focusing
on the first term.

909
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,450
The position of this wave packet
at late times, a positive t,

910
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,932
is positive, and
when it's positive,

911
00:42:22,932 --> 00:42:24,890
then this theta function
kills its contribution

912
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,860
to the overall wave function.

913
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,410
This theta is now theta
of minus a positive number

914
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,060
and this Gaussian is gone.

915
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,510
What is it replaced by?

916
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,060
Well, these two terms
aren't necessarily 0.

917
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,350
In particular, this one
is moving to the left.

918
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,120
So as time goes forward, x
is moving further and further

919
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,190
to the left, and so this theta
function starts turning on.

920
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,490
And similarly, as
x goes positive,

921
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,290
this theta function
starts turning on as well.

922
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:59,959
Let's focus on this third
term, the transmitted term.

923
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,250
Let's focus on this third term.

924
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:08,120

925
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,400
In particular, that term looks
like integral dk over root 2

926
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,130
pi, f times the transmission
amplitude times e

927
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,590
to the ikx minus omega t.

928
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,540

929
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,680
And there's an overall
theta of x outside,

930
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,810
but for late times where
the center of the wave

931
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,510
packet where the transmitted
wave packet should be positive,

932
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,255
this theta is just going to be
1 so we can safely ignore it.

933
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:37,740
It's just saying we're
far off to the right.

934
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,700
And now I want to
do one last thing.

935
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,310
This was an overall envelope.

936
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,025
This t was our
scattering amplitude,

937
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:47,900
and I want to write it
in the following form.

938
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,410
I want to write it as root
T e to the minus i phi

939
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,287
where phi is k.

940
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:55,870
So what this is
saying is that indeed,

941
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,703
as was pointed out
earlier, the norm squared

942
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:01,010
of this coefficient T is the
transmission probability,

943
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,540
but it has a phase.

944
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,520
And what I want to know is
what does this phase mean?

945
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,360
What information is
contained in this phase?

946
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,110
And that's what
we're about to find.

947
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,470
So let's put that in.

948
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:18,030
Here we have root
T and minus phi

949
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,952
where omega and phi
are both functions of k

950
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:22,410
because the
transmission amplitudes

951
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,260
depend on the momentum,
or the energy.

952
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,840
And now I again want to know,
how does this wave packet move?

953
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,930
If I look at this wave packet,
how does it move en masse?

954
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,510
As a group of waves, how
does this wave packet move?

955
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,130
In particular,
with what velocity?

956
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,560
I'll again make an argument
by stationary phase.

957
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,960
I'll look at a point
of phase equals 0

958
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,565
and ask how it moves over time.

959
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:47,940
And the point of
stationary phase

960
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,860
is again given by d dk of
the phase kx minus omega

961
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:01,220
of kt minus phi of k is equal
to 0 evaluated at k0, which

962
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,200
is where our envelope
is sharply peaked.

963
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,470

964
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,420
This expression
is equal to-- this

965
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,730
is, again, x minus d omega dk.

966
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:22,250
That's the classical velocity,
v0 t-- minus d phi dk.

967
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:28,495
But just as a note, d phi
dk is equal to d omega dk,

968
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:34,290
d phi d omega, but
this is equal to-- this

969
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,110
is just the chain rule.
d omega dk, that's

970
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,310
the classical velocity.

971
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:45,230
d phi d omega, that's
d phi dE times h bar.

972
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,510
I just multiplied by h
bar on the top and bottom.

973
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:57,280
So this is equal to x minus
v0 t plus h bar d phi dE.

974
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,480

975
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,100
So first off, let's just make
sure that the units make sense.

976
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,997
That's a length,
that's a velocity,

977
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:06,580
so this had better
have units of time.

978
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,950
Time, that's good.

979
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,890
So h bar times d phase over dE.

980
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,970
Well, phase is dimensionless,
energy is units of energy,

981
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,390
h is energy times time, so
this dimensionally works out.

982
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,500
So this is 0.

983
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,630
So the claim is the
point of stationary phase

984
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,260
has this derivative equal to
0, so setting this equal to 0

985
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,580
tells us that the peak
of the wave function

986
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,650
moves according
to this equation.

987
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,420

988
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,915
So this is really satisfying.

989
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:37,290
This should be really satisfying
for a couple of reasons.

990
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:41,440
First off, it tells you that
the peak of the transmitted wave

991
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,460
packet, not just a plain wave,
the peak of the actual wave

992
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,100
packet, well localized,
moves with overall velocity

993
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,860
v0, the constant velocity
that we started with,

994
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,530
and that's good.

995
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,280
If it was moving with
some other velocity,

996
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,696
we would have lost
energy somehow.

997
00:46:54,696 --> 00:46:57,600
That would be not so sensible.

998
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,240
So this wave packet is moving
with an overall velocity v0.

999
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,650
However, it doesn't
move along just

1000
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,300
as the original wave
packet's peak had.

1001
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,550
It moves as if shifted in time.

1002
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,560

1003
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,920
So the phase, and more to
the point, the gradient

1004
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,420
of the phase with
respect to energy,

1005
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,150
the rate of change with energy
of the phase times h bar

1006
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:28,690
is giving us a shift in the time
of where the wave packet is.

1007
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,530
What does that mean?

1008
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,730

1009
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:33,910
Let's be precise about this.

1010
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:43,120

1011
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,545
Let's interpret this.

1012
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:47,420
Here's the interpretation
I want to give you.

1013
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,160

1014
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,070
Consider classically the system.

1015
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,180
Classically, we have an
object with some energy,

1016
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,390
and it rolls along and it finds
a potential well, and what

1017
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,200
happens when it gets
into the potential well?

1018
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,494
It speeds up.

1019
00:48:05,494 --> 00:48:06,910
because it's got
a lot more energy

1020
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,790
relative to the potential.

1021
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,290
So it goes much faster in here
and it gets to the other side

1022
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,460
and it slows down again.

1023
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,571
So if I had taken a
particle with velocity--

1024
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:15,070
let's call this
position 0 and let's

1025
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,680
say it gets to this
wall at time 0,

1026
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,390
so it's moving with
x is equal to v0 t,

1027
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,060
if there had been
no barrier there,

1028
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,018
then at subsequent times,
it would get out here

1029
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:29,160
in a time that distance
over v0, right?

1030
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,570
However, imagine this well
was extraordinarily deep.

1031
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,330
If this well were
extraordinarily deep,

1032
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,530
what would happen?

1033
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,840
Well basically, in here, its
velocity is arbitrarily large,

1034
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,145
and it would just immediately
jump across this well.

1035
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:45,180

1036
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,460
This would be a perfectly
good description of the motion

1037
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,020
before it gets to the well,
but after it leaves the well,

1038
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:57,290
the position is going
to be v0 t plus-- well,

1039
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,520
what's the time shift?

1040
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,430
The time shift is
the time that we

1041
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,080
didn't need to cross this gap.

1042
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,540
And how much would
that time have been?

1043
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,220
Well, it's the distance
divided by the velocity.

1044
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,300
That's the time we didn't need.

1045
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,740
So t plus-- it moves as
if it's at a later time--

1046
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,430
t plus L over v0.

1047
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,944
Cool?

1048
00:49:22,944 --> 00:49:25,360
So if we had a really deep
well and we watched a particle,

1049
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,120
we would watch it move x0,
x v0 t, v0 t, v0 t, v0 t

1050
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,550
plus L over v, v0
t plus L over v.

1051
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,560
So it's the time that we made
up by being deep in the well.

1052
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,450
So there's a classical picture
because it goes faster inside.

1053
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:44,520
So comparing these, here
we've done a calculation

1054
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,760
of the time shift due
to the quantum particle

1055
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:54,390
quantum mechanically
transiting the potential well.

1056
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,430
So let's compare these.

1057
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,420

1058
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,530
This says the classical
prediction is the time it took,

1059
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:08,130
delta t, classical is
equal to L over v0,

1060
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,940
and the question is,
is this the same?

1061
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,880
One way to phrase this question
is, is it the same as h bar d

1062
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:21,350
phi dE evaluated at k0?

1063
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:28,100

1064
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:35,290
From our results last time,
for the amplitude c over a,

1065
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,860
we get that phi is equal
to-- which is just minus

1066
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:46,430
the argument, or the phase, of
c over a, or of the transmission

1067
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,254
amplitude little
t-- phi turns out

1068
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:58,670
to be equal to k2 L minus arctan
of k1 squared plus k2 squared

1069
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:06,290
over 2 k1 k2, tan of
k2 L. I look at this

1070
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,870
and it doesn't tell
me all that much.

1071
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,444
It's a little bit bewildering,
so let's unpack this.

1072
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:11,860
What we really
want to know is, is

1073
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,318
this close to the
classical result?

1074
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:20,050

1075
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:22,120
Here's a quick way to check.

1076
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,630
We know this expression is
going to simplify near resonance

1077
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,100
where the sine vanishes,
so let's look, just

1078
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,130
for simplicity,
near the resonance.

1079
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,380
And in particular, let's
look near the resonance k2 L

1080
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,974
is equal to n pi.

1081
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:39,140
Then it turns out that a
quick calculation gives you

1082
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,840
that h bar d phi dE
at this value of k,

1083
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,540
at that value of the energy,
goes as L over 2 v0 times

1084
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:56,840
1 plus the energy over
the depth of the well, v0.

1085
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,070
Now remember, the classical
approximation was L over v0.

1086
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,330
We just did this very quickly.

1087
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,310
We did it assuming an
arbitrarily deep well.

1088
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,820
So v0 is arbitrarily
larger in magnitude than E,

1089
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,222
so this term is negligible.

1090
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:09,180
Where we should compare
that very simple, naive

1091
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,510
classical result is
here, L over 2 v0.

1092
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,180
And what we see is that the
quantum mechanical result

1093
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,030
gives a time shift which
is down by a factor of 2.

1094
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,920

1095
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,880
So what's going on?

1096
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,950
Well, apparently, the
things slow down inside.

1097
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,630
The time that it
took us to cross

1098
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,810
was greater than you
would have naively guessed

1099
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,530
by making it arbitrarily deep.

1100
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,590
And we can make that
a little more sharp

1101
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:46,380
by plotting, as a function of
E over v0, the actual phase

1102
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,984
shift.

1103
00:52:47,984 --> 00:52:50,150
If do a better job than
saying it's infinitely deep,

1104
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:55,720
the classical prediction
looks something like this,

1105
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,109
and this is for delta t,
the time shift, classical.

1106
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:03,400
When you look at the correct
quantum mechanical result,

1107
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:19,920
here's what you find,
where the difference is

1108
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,570
a factor of 2, 1/2 the
height down, and again,

1109
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,450
1/2 the height down.

1110
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,810
So this is that factor
of 2 downstairs.

1111
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:32,442
So the wave packet goes
actually a little bit faster

1112
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:33,900
than the classical
prediction would

1113
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,440
guess except near
resonance, and these

1114
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,815
are at the resonant
values of the momentum.

1115
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,440
At the resonant values
of the momentum,

1116
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,971
it takes much longer
to get across.

1117
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,470
Instead of going a
little bit faster

1118
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,430
than the classical
result, it goes a factor

1119
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,570
of 2 slower than the
classical result.

1120
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,050
And so now I ask
you the question,

1121
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,450
why is it going more slowly?

1122
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:55,190
Why does it spend so much more
time inside the well quantum

1123
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,810
mechanically than it
would have classically?

1124
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,830
Why is the particle effectively
taking so much longer

1125
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,990
to transit the well
near resonance?

1126
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,449
AUDIENCE: Because it can
reflect and it can keep going

1127
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:08,490
and a classical particle
is not going to do that.

1128
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

1129
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,950
So the classical particle
just goes across.

1130
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,160
The quantum mechanical
particle has a superposition

1131
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,534
of contributions
to its amplitude

1132
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:17,792
where it transits-- transit,
bounce, bounce, transit,

1133
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:20,560
transit, bounce, bounce,
bounce, bounce, transit.

1134
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,250
And now you can
ask, how much time

1135
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,540
was spent by each of those
imaginary particles imaginarily

1136
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,005
moving across?

1137
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:29,380
And if you're careful about
how you set up that question,

1138
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,740
you can recover this factor of
2, which is kind of beautiful.

1139
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,640
But the important thing here is
when you're hitting resonance,

1140
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,780
the multiple scattering
processes are important.

1141
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,040
They're not canceling out.

1142
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,270
They're not at random phase.

1143
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,030
They're not interfering
destructively with each other.

1144
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,488
They're interfering
constructively,

1145
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:47,700
and you get perfect
transmission precisely

1146
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,160
because of the
constructive interference

1147
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,050
of an infinite number
of contributions

1148
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,882
to the quantum
mechanical amplitude.

1149
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:56,840
And this is, again, we're
seeing the same thing

1150
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,550
in this annoying slow down.

1151
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,150
This tells us another
thing, though,

1152
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,110
which is that the
scattering phase, the phase

1153
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,650
in the transmission
amplitude, contains

1154
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,400
an awful lot of the
physics of the system.

1155
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,350
It's telling us about how long
it takes for the wave packet

1156
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,680
to transit across the
potential, effectively.

1157
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,347
Yeah?

1158
00:55:15,347 --> 00:55:16,600
AUDIENCE: What's the
vertical axis being used for?

1159
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,308
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

1160
00:55:17,308 --> 00:55:21,620
The vertical axis
here is the shift

1161
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,300
in the time due to the fact
that it went across this well

1162
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,700
and went a little
bit faster inside.

1163
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,580
So empirically, what it means is
when you get out very far away

1164
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,070
and you watch the motion
of the wave packet,

1165
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,794
and you ask, how long
has it been since it got

1166
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,210
to the barrier in
the first place,

1167
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,640
it took less time than
you would have guessed

1168
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,400
by knowing that its velocity is
v0, and the amount of time less

1169
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,757
is this much time.

1170
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:43,840
That answer your question?

1171
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,720
Good.

1172
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,972
Yeah?

1173
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:48,710
AUDIENCE: Why is each
of the amplitudes 1/2?

1174
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,880
Why is the first one, and
it bounces around twice.

1175
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,847

1176
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,930
PROFESSOR: When we compare
the classical amplitude

1177
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,140
and the limit that
v0 goes to infinity?

1178
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,660
The comparison is
just a factor of 2.

1179
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,150
It's more complicated out here.

1180
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:10,428
In the limit that v0 is
large, this is exactly 1/2.

1181
00:56:10,428 --> 00:56:11,344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1182
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:13,779

1183
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:15,320
PROFESSOR: The
resonances are leading

1184
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,486
to this extra factor of 1/2.

1185
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:18,907

1186
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:20,490
I have to say I don't
remember exactly

1187
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,020
whether, as you include
the sub-leading terms of 1

1188
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,590
over v0, whether it stays
1/2 or whether it doesn't,

1189
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,480
but in the limit
that v0 is large,

1190
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,500
it remains either close
to 1/2 or exactly 1/2,

1191
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,750
I just don't remember exactly.

1192
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,000
The important thing is
that there's a sharp dip.

1193
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,680
It takes much longer to transit,
and so you get less bonus time,

1194
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,240
as it were.

1195
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,370
You've gained less time in
the quantum mechanical model

1196
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,822
than the classical model.

1197
00:56:44,822 --> 00:56:47,280
And when you do the experiment,
you get the quantum result.

1198
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,940

1199
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,580
That's the crucial point.

1200
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,260
Other questions?

1201
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,680

1202
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,290
So the phase contains an
awful lot of the physics.

1203
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,240

1204
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,440
So I want to generalize
this whole story

1205
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,920
in a very particular way,
this way of reorganizing

1206
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,140
the scattering in 1D.

1207
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,060
What we're doing
right now is we're

1208
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,060
studying scattering
problems in one dimension,

1209
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,900
but we live in three dimensions.

1210
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,983
The story is going to be
more complicated in three

1211
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:20,483
dimensions.

1212
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:22,649
It's going to be more
complicated in two dimensions,

1213
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:24,220
but the basic ideas
are all the same.

1214
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,219
It's just the details are
going to be different.

1215
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:29,420
And one thing that turns out
to be very useful in organizing

1216
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,449
scattering, both
in one dimension

1217
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,990
and in three
dimensions, is something

1218
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,198
called the scattering matrix.

1219
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:35,870
I'm going to talk
about that now.

1220
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,380
In three dimensions,
it's essential,

1221
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,720
but even in one dimension,
where it's usually not used,

1222
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,360
it's a very powerful
way to organize

1223
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,350
our knowledge of the system as
encoded by the scattering data.

1224
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,000
So here's the basic idea.

1225
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,800
As we discussed
before, what we really

1226
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,420
want to do in the ideal world
is take some unknown potential

1227
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,510
in some bounded
region, some region,

1228
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,660
and outside, we have the
potential is constant.

1229
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,300
[INAUDIBLE] my bad
artistic skills.

1230
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,740
So potential is
constant out here.

1231
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,990
And the potential could be
some horrible thing in here

1232
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,490
that we don't happen
to know, and we

1233
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,530
want to read off of
the scattering process,

1234
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,500
we want to be able to deduce
something about the potential.

1235
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:26,190
So for example, we
can deduce the energy

1236
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:30,920
by looking at the
position of the barriers,

1237
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,380
and we can disentangle
the position of the energy

1238
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,350
and the depth and the width
by looking at the phase shift,

1239
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,680
by looking at the time delay.

1240
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,940
So we can deduce all the
parameters of our potential

1241
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,830
by looking at the resonance
points and the phase shift.

1242
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:46,665
I want to do this more
generally for general potential.

1243
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:48,040
And to set that
up, we need to be

1244
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,150
a bit more general
than we've been.

1245
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:54,060

1246
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,730
So in general, if we
solve this potential,

1247
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:02,270
as we talked about before, we
have A and B, e to the ikx,

1248
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,850
e to the minus ikx out
here, and out here, we

1249
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:11,278
have C e to the ikx and
D e to the minus ikx.

1250
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:14,235

1251
00:59:14,235 --> 00:59:16,110
And I'm not going to
ask what happens inside.

1252
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,377

1253
00:59:19,377 --> 00:59:20,960
Now we can do, as
discussed, two kinds

1254
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,043
of scattering experiments.

1255
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:24,220
We can send things in from
the left, in which case

1256
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,100
A is nonzero, and then things
can either transmit or reflect,

1257
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,755
but nothing's going to come
in from infinity, so D is 0.

1258
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:31,130
Or we can do the
same in reverse.

1259
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,254
Send things in from here,
and that corresponds to A

1260
00:59:33,254 --> 00:59:36,630
is 0, nothing coming in
this way but d0 and 0.

1261
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,900
And more generally, we can
ask the following question.

1262
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,950
Suppose I send some amount
of stuff in from the left

1263
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,010
and I send some amount of stuff
in from the right, D. Then

1264
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,650
that will tell me how much stuff
will be going out to the right

1265
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,150
and how much stuff will
be going out to the left.

1266
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,040
If you tell me how
much is coming in,

1267
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:59,440
I will tell you how much
is coming out, B, C.

1268
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,630
So if you could
solve this problem,

1269
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,480
the answer is just some
paralinear relations

1270
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,080
between these, and we can write
this as a matrix, which I will

1271
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:15,030
S11, S12, S21, S22.

1272
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,650
What this matrix is doing is
it takes the amplitude you're

1273
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,120
sending in from
the left to right

1274
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,344
and tells you the amplitude
coming out to the left

1275
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:22,010
or to the right.

1276
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:22,833
Yes?

1277
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,870
AUDIENCE: How do we know
this relation is linear?

1278
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:28,850
PROFESSOR: If you double the
amount of stuff coming in,

1279
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,030
then you must double the
amount of stuff going out

1280
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,420
or probability is not conserved.

1281
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,070

1282
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,120
Also, we've derived
these relations.

1283
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,730
You know how the relations work.

1284
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,769
The relations work by satisfying
a series of linear equations

1285
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,310
between the various
coefficients such

1286
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,855
that you have continuity
and differentiability at all

1287
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,634
the matching points.

1288
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:50,050
But the crucial
thing of linearity

1289
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:54,034
is probability is conserved
and time evolution is linear.

1290
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:54,700
Other questions?

1291
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,540

1292
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,100
So this is just some stupid
matrix, and we call it,

1293
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,505
not surprisingly, the S
matrix in all of its majesty.

1294
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:09,510

1295
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:10,810
The basic idea is this.

1296
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,685
For scattering problems, if
someone tells you the S matrix,

1297
01:01:13,685 --> 01:01:15,310
and in particular,
if someone tells you

1298
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:18,892
how all the coefficients of
the S matrix vary with energy,

1299
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:21,100
then you've completely solved
any scattering problem.

1300
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,950
You tell me what A and D are.

1301
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:23,450
Great.

1302
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,071
I'll tell you exactly what
B and C are mode by mode,

1303
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:27,570
and I can do this
for superposition.

1304
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:30,377
So this allows you to completely
solve any scattering problem

1305
01:01:30,377 --> 01:01:31,960
in quantum mechanics
once you know it.

1306
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,176
So it suffices to know S to
solve all scattering problems.

1307
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:38,270

1308
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,520
I want to now spend just a
little bit of time thinking

1309
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,310
about what properties the
S matrix and its components

1310
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,580
must satisfy.

1311
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,210
What properties
must the S matrix

1312
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:51,400
satisfy in order to
jibe well with the rest

1313
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,610
of the rules of
quantum mechanics?

1314
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,760
I'm not going to study
any particular system.

1315
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,480
I just want to ask
general questions.

1316
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,510
So the first thing
that must be true

1317
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,285
is that stuff doesn't disappear.

1318
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:11,950

1319
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:16,120
Disapparate is probably
the appropriate.

1320
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,870
Stuff doesn't leak
out of the world,

1321
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,490
so whatever goes
in must come out.

1322
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,760
What that means is norm of
A squared plus norm of D

1323
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,970
squared, which is the
probability density in

1324
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,030
and probability
density out, must

1325
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:32,000
be equal to B squared
plus C squared.

1326
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,160

1327
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,422
Everyone agree with that?

1328
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,340
AUDIENCE: Why can't stuff
stay in the potential?

1329
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,960
PROFESSOR: Why can't stuff
stay in the potential?

1330
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,350
That's a good.

1331
01:02:46,350 --> 01:03:00,750

1332
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,260
So if we're looking at
fixed energy eigenstates,

1333
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,070
we know that we're in
a stationary state,

1334
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:09,200
so whatever the amplitude
going into the middle is,

1335
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,187
it must also be coming
out of the middle.

1336
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:13,770
There's another way
to say this, which

1337
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,520
is let's think about it not
in terms of individual energy

1338
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,020
eigenstates.

1339
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,936
Let's think about it in
terms of wave packets.

1340
01:03:18,936 --> 01:03:20,590
So if we take a
wave packet of stuff

1341
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,400
and we send in that wave packet,
it has some momentum, right?

1342
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,280

1343
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,190
This is going to get
delicate and technical.

1344
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:31,040
Let me just stick with
the first statement, which

1345
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,350
is that if stuff
is going in, then

1346
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,140
it has to also be
coming out by the fact

1347
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,150
that this is an
energy eigenstate.

1348
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,650
The overall probability
distribution

1349
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,810
is not changing in time.

1350
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:43,324

1351
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:44,990
If stuff went in and
it didn't come out,

1352
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,770
that would mean
it's staying there.

1353
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:46,700
That would mean
that the probability

1354
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,060
density is changing in time.

1355
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
That's not what happens
in an energy eigenstate.

1356
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,631
The probability distribution
is time independent.

1357
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:54,630
Everyone cool with that?

1358
01:03:54,630 --> 01:04:02,380

1359
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,570
So let's think, though,
about what this is.

1360
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:07,080
I can write this in
the following nice way.

1361
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:12,440
I can write this as A
complex conjugate D complex

1362
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,522
conjugate, AD.

1363
01:04:16,522 --> 01:04:17,980
And on the right
hand side, this is

1364
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:23,525
equal to B complex conjugate,
C complex conjugate, BC.

1365
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:25,400
I have done nothing
other than write this out

1366
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,440
in some suggested form.

1367
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,760
But B and C are equal
to the S matrix,

1368
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,380
so BC is the S matrix times
A, and B complex conjugate,

1369
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,550
C complex conjugate is the
transposed complex conjugate.

1370
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:44,970
So this is equal to A complex
conjugate, D complex conjugate,

1371
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:48,620
S transpose complex conjugate,
also known as adjoint,

1372
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,370
and this is S on AD.

1373
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:55,010

1374
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,100
Yeah?

1375
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,360
But this has to be equal
to this for any A and D.

1376
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,750
So what must be true of
S dagger S as a matrix?

1377
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,230
It's got to be the identity
as a matrix in order for this

1378
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,450
to be true for all A and D. Ah.

1379
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,170
That's cool.

1380
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,500
Stuff doesn't disappear.

1381
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,970
S is a unitary matrix.

1382
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:23,640

1383
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,980
So S is a unitary matrix.

1384
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:31,090

1385
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,290
Its inverse is its adjoint.

1386
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:43,110

1387
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:47,530
You'll study this in a little
more detail on the problem set.

1388
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,190
You studied the
definition of unitary

1389
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,316
on the last problem set.

1390
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,690
So that's the
first thing about S

1391
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,500
and it turns out to
be completely general.

1392
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,990
Anytime, whether you're in one
dimension or two dimensions

1393
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:01,550
or three, if you send stuff
in, it should not get stuck.

1394
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,360
It should come out.

1395
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,064
And when it does come
out, the statement

1396
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:07,730
that it comes out for
energy eigenstates

1397
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,850
is the statement that
S is a unitary matrix.

1398
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:11,876
Questions on that.

1399
01:06:11,876 --> 01:06:17,840

1400
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:29,760
So a consequence of that is
that the eigenvalues of S

1401
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,510
are phases, pure phases.

1402
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:35,020

1403
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,800
So I can write S--
I'll write them

1404
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,480
as S1 is equal to
e to the i of phi 1

1405
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,824
and S2 is equal
to the i of phi 2.

1406
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:53,090

1407
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:56,970
So the statement that
S is a unitary matrix

1408
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,362
leads to constraints
on the coefficients,

1409
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:02,570
and you're going to derive
these on your problem set.

1410
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:03,910
I'm just going to list them now.

1411
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:07,960
The first is that
the magnitude of S11

1412
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,840
is equal to the
magnitude of S22.

1413
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,970
The magnitude of S12 is equal
to the magnitude of S21.

1414
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:24,200

1415
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:31,880
More importantly, S12 norm
squared plus S11 squared

1416
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,990
is equal to 1.

1417
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:43,670
And finally, S11, S12 complex
conjugate, plus S21, S22

1418
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:47,010
complex conjugate is equal to 0.

1419
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:51,820
So what do these mean?

1420
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,453
What are these
conditions telling us?

1421
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:56,877

1422
01:07:56,877 --> 01:07:58,460
They're telling us,
of course, they're

1423
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,490
a consequence of
conservational probability,

1424
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,950
but they have another meaning.

1425
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,491
To get that other
meaning, let's look

1426
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:07,230
at the definition of the
transmission amplitudes.

1427
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:09,890
In particular, consider
the case that we send stuff

1428
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,390
in from the left and
nothing in from the right.

1429
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,830
That corresponds to D equals 0.

1430
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,710
When D equals 0, what
does this tell us?

1431
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,899
It tells us that B
is equal to-- and A

1432
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,119
equals 1 for normalization.

1433
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:24,740

1434
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:30,810
B is equal to-- well, D is
equal to 0, so it's just S11 A,

1435
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:35,029
so B over A is S11.

1436
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:40,601
And similarly, C over A is S21.

1437
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,100
But C over A is the
thing that we've

1438
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,720
been calling the transmission
amplitude, little t,

1439
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,109
and this is the reflection
amplitude, little r.

1440
01:08:48,109 --> 01:08:51,140
So this is the reflection
amplitude, if we send in stuff

1441
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,479
and it bounces off,
reflects to the left,

1442
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,869
and this is the transmission
amplitude for transmitting

1443
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:56,410
to the right.

1444
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,529

1445
01:08:58,529 --> 01:08:59,529
Everyone cool with that?

1446
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:02,279

1447
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,380
This is reflection
to the left, this

1448
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,085
is transmission to the right.

1449
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:08,210
By the same token, this is
going to be transmission

1450
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,060
to the left and
reflection to the right.

1451
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,680

1452
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,840
So now let's look
at these conditions.

1453
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,350
S11 is reflection and this
is going to be reflection.

1454
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,350
This says that the
reflection to the left

1455
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,875
is equal to the reflection
to the right in magnitude.

1456
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,910

1457
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:30,149
Before, what we saw was
for the simple step,

1458
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:32,660
the reflection amplitude was
equal from left to right, not

1459
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,430
just the magnitude,
but the actual value

1460
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,100
was equal from the
left and the right.

1461
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,350
It was a little bit of a
cheat because they were real.

1462
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,217

1463
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,800
And we saw that that
was a consequence

1464
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,870
of just being the step.

1465
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:43,970
We didn't know
anything more about it.

1466
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,595
But now we see that
on general grounds,

1467
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,309
on conservation of
probability grounds,

1468
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,100
the magnitude of the
reflection to the left

1469
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,510
and to the right for any
potential had better be equal.

1470
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:57,490
And similarly, the magnitude of
the transmission for the left

1471
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:03,120
and the transmission to the
right had better be equal,

1472
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,540
all other things being-- if
you're sending in from the left

1473
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,140
and then transmitting
to the left,

1474
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,598
or sending in from the right
and transmitting to the right.

1475
01:10:10,598 --> 01:10:12,170
And what does this one tell us?

1476
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:18,130
Well, S12 and S11, that tells
us that little t squared, which

1477
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:23,890
is the total probability to
transmit, plus little r squared

1478
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:27,040
is the total probability
to reflect, is equal to 1,

1479
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,350
and we saw this last time, too.

1480
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:32,360

1481
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,630
This was the earlier definition
of nothing gets stuck.

1482
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:39,771
And this one you'll study
on your problem set.

1483
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:41,254
It's a little more subtle.

1484
01:10:41,254 --> 01:10:45,440

1485
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,935
Questions?

1486
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:47,435
Yeah?

1487
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:50,345
AUDIENCE: Can you explain one
more time why is S unitary?

1488
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:51,777
How did you get that?

1489
01:10:51,777 --> 01:10:54,110
PROFESSOR: So the way we got
S was unitary is first off,

1490
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,740
this is just the
definition of S. S

1491
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,800
is the matrix that,
for any energy,

1492
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,500
relates A and D, the
ingoing amplitudes,

1493
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,830
to the outgoing amplitudes B
and C. Just the definition.

1494
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,640
Meanwhile, I claim that
stuff doesn't go away,

1495
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,010
nothing gets stuck,
nothing disappears,

1496
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,350
so the total probability
density of stuff going in

1497
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,550
must be equal to the
total probability

1498
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,675
density of stuff going out.

1499
01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:15,826

1500
01:11:15,826 --> 01:11:17,200
The probability
of stuff going in

1501
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,970
can be expressed as this
row vector times this column

1502
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:23,020
vector, and on the out, this
row vector times this column

1503
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,560
vector, and then we use the
definition of the S matrix.

1504
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,590
This column vector is equal
to S times this row vector.

1505
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,800

1506
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,090
BC is equal to S times AD.

1507
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,470
And when we take the
transposed complex conjugate,

1508
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:39,050
I get AD transposed
complex conjugate,

1509
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:42,040
S transposed complex conjugate,
but that's the S adjoint.

1510
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,730
But in order for this to be
true for any vectors A and D,

1511
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:50,340
it must be that S dagger S
is unitary is the identity,

1512
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,340
but that's the definition
of a unitary matrix.

1513
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,270
Cool?

1514
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,770
Others.

1515
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,240

1516
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,100
You're going to prove
a variety of things

1517
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:07,370
on the problem set
about the scattering

1518
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,930
matrix and its
coefficients, but I

1519
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:12,600
want to show you two
properties of it.

1520
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,630
The first is reasonably
tame, and it'll

1521
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:21,135
make a little sharper the
step result we got earlier

1522
01:12:21,135 --> 01:12:23,260
that the reflection in both
directions off the step

1523
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,170
potential was in fact
exactly the same.

1524
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:34,974

1525
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:36,890
Suppose our system is
time reversal invariant.

1526
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:40,390

1527
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,990
So if t goes to minus
t, nothing changes.

1528
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,490
This would not be
true, for example,

1529
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,365
if we had electric
currents in our system

1530
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:50,797
because as we take t to minus
t, then the current reverses.

1531
01:12:50,797 --> 01:12:52,630
So if the current shows
up in the potential,

1532
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,140
or if a magnetic
field due to a current

1533
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,620
shows up in the
potential energy,

1534
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,090
then as we change
t to minus t, we

1535
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:58,590
change the direction
of the current,

1536
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:01,250
we change the direction
of the magnetic field.

1537
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,879
In simple systems where we
have time reversal invariance,

1538
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,420
for example,
electrostatics, but not,

1539
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,590
for example, magnetostatics,
suppose we have time reversal

1540
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:13,560
invariance, then what you've
shown on a previous problem

1541
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,060
set is that psi is a
solution, then psi star,

1542
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,820
psi complex conjugate
is also a solution.

1543
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,920

1544
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,882
And using these, what you'll
see what you can show--

1545
01:13:26,882 --> 01:13:28,590
and I'm not going to
go through the steps

1546
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,750
for this-- well, that's easy.

1547
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,010
If we do the time reversal,
the wave function,

1548
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,160
looking on the left or on the
right, so comparing these guys,

1549
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,650
what changes?

1550
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,244
Under time reversal,
we get a solution.

1551
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:45,160
Given this solution, we
have another solution,

1552
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,990
A star e to the minus ikx,
B star e to the plus ikx.

1553
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:55,082
Minus star, star, plus.

1554
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:56,540
So we can run
exactly the same game

1555
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,168
but now with this amplitude.

1556
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:02,760

1557
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,680
And when you put the
conditions together,

1558
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,850
which you'll do on the problem
set, another way to say this

1559
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:12,220
is the same solution with k
to minus k and with A and B

1560
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,780
replaced by their
complex conjugates

1561
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:17,480
and C and D replaced by each
other's complex conjugates.

1562
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,810
Then this implies
that it must be true

1563
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:25,840
that A and D, which are now
the outgoing guys because we've

1564
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,780
time reversed, is equal
to S-- and I'll write this

1565
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:39,440
out explicitly-- S11, S12,
S21, S22, B star, and C star.

1566
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,530

1567
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,440
So these together give you that.

1568
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,950

1569
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:53,500
Therefore, S complex
conjugate S is equal to 1.

1570
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,460

1571
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,780
If S complex conjugate
S is equal to 1,

1572
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:05,160
then S inverse is
equal to S transpose,

1573
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,840
just putting this on the right.

1574
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,027
So S transpose is equal to S
inverse is equal to S adjoint

1575
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,110
because S is also unitary.

1576
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,910

1577
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:26,960
So time reversal invariance
implies, for example,

1578
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,590
that S dagger is
equal to S star,

1579
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,673
or S equal to S transpose.

1580
01:15:29,673 --> 01:15:36,380

1581
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,880
This is what I
wanted to write here.

1582
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,390
Gives us that S is
equal to S transpose.

1583
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:46,110
And in particular, this tells
us that S21 is equal to S12.

1584
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,950
The off diagonal
terms are equal,

1585
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:52,650
not just in magnitude, which
was insured by unitary,

1586
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:55,457
but if, in addition to
being a unitary system,

1587
01:15:55,457 --> 01:15:57,540
which of course, it should
be, if in addition it's

1588
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,580
time reversal invariant, then we
see that the off diagonal terms

1589
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,104
are equal not just in
magnitude but also in phase.

1590
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:04,770
And as you know, the
phase is important.

1591
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:06,480
The phase contains physics.

1592
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,930
It tells you about time delays
and shifts in the scattering

1593
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:10,576
process.

1594
01:16:10,576 --> 01:16:11,700
So the phases are the same.

1595
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,200
That statement is
not a trivial one.

1596
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,080
It contains physics.

1597
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,960
So when the system is time
reversal invariant, the phases

1598
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,890
as well as the
amplitudes are the same.

1599
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,120
And you'll derive a series
of related conditions

1600
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,482
or consequences for the S
matrix from various properties

1601
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:28,940
of the system, for
example, parity,

1602
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,670
if you could have a
symmetric potential.

1603
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,375
But now in the last
few minutes, I just

1604
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:35,920
want to tell you a
really lovely thing.

1605
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,730
So it should be pretty
clear at this point

1606
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,170
that all the information
about scattering

1607
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,806
is contained in the S matrix and
its dependence on the energy.

1608
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:44,680
If you know what the
incident amplitudes are,

1609
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,236
you know what the
outgoing amplitudes are,

1610
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:49,110
and that's cool because
you can measure this.

1611
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,191
You can take a potential,
you can literally just

1612
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,690
send in a beam of
particles, and you

1613
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,970
can ask, how likely
are they to get out.

1614
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:59,180
And more importantly, if I
build a wave packet, on average,

1615
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,049
what's the time
delay or acceleration

1616
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:03,340
of the transmitted wave packet?

1617
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,890
And that way, I can
measure the phase as well.

1618
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,630
I can measure both the
transmission probabilities

1619
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,110
and the phases, or at least
the gradient of the phase

1620
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,800
with energy.

1621
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,300
Go ahead.

1622
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,883
AUDIENCE: Is there
a special condition

1623
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:16,330
that we can [? pose ?]
to see the resonance?

1624
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:17,580
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

1625
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,569
Hold onto your
question for a second.

1626
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,860
There's an enormous amount
of the physics of scattering

1627
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:25,529
contained in the S matrix, and
you can measure the S matrix,

1628
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:27,570
and you can measure its
dependence on the energy.

1629
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:31,070
You can measure the coefficients
S12 and S22, their phases

1630
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,780
and their amplitudes,
as a function of energy,

1631
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,970
and you can plot them.

1632
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,660
Here's what I want
to convince you of.

1633
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:41,480
If you plot those and look
at how the functions behave

1634
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,560
as functions of energy and ask,
how do those functions extend

1635
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,680
to negative energy by
just drawing the line,

1636
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,260
continuing the lines,
you can derive the energy

1637
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:55,320
of any bound states
in the system, too.

1638
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,950
Knowledge of the scattering is
enough to determine the bound

1639
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,952
state energies of a system,
and let me show you that.

1640
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:05,410
And this is one of the coolest
things in quantum mechanics.

1641
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,760
Here's how this works.

1642
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,740
We have, from the
definition of the S matrix,

1643
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:13,930
that BC is equal to
the S matrix on AD,

1644
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,790
where the wave
function-- let me just

1645
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:20,930
put this back in the original
form-- is CD, AB, e to the ikx,

1646
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:26,812
e to the minus ikx, and e to the
plus ikx, e to the minus ikx.

1647
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:28,520
So that's the definition
of the S matrix.

1648
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,730
The S matrix, at
a given energy e,

1649
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,060
is a coefficient relation
matrix between the ingoing

1650
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,820
and outgoing, or, more
to the point, A and D.

1651
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,850
And in all of this, I've assumed
that the energy was positive,

1652
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:42,840
that the k1 and k2
are positive and real.

1653
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,340
But now let's ask
the question, what

1654
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,215
would have happened if,
in the whole process,

1655
01:18:46,215 --> 01:18:53,490
I had taken the
energy less than 0?

1656
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:57,280
If the energy were less
than 0, instead of k,

1657
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,490
k would be replaced by i alpha.

1658
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:01,240
Let's think about
what that does.

1659
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:07,540
If k is i alpha, this is
e to the ik is minus alpha

1660
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:11,350
and minus ik is plus alpha.

1661
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:15,890
Similarly, ik times i,
that gives me a minus alpha

1662
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:18,730
and this gives me a plus alpha.

1663
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:19,770
Yeah?

1664
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:21,800
So as equations, they're
the same equations

1665
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,800
with k replaced by i alpha.

1666
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,030
And now what must be
true for these states

1667
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,870
to be normalizable?

1668
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,890
What must be true,
for example, of A?

1669
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,070

1670
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:40,770
A must be 0 because at minus
infinity, there's divergence.

1671
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,416
Not normalizable.

1672
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,790
So in order to be
at bound state,

1673
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:47,160
in order to have a physical
state, A must be 0.

1674
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,416
What about D?

1675
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:50,220
Same reason.

1676
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,930
It's got to be 0 at
positive infinity.

1677
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,470
These guys are convergent,
so C and B can be non-zero.

1678
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:57,800
So now here's my question.

1679
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,760
We know that these
relations must be true

1680
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,690
because all these relations are
encoding is how a solution here

1681
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:07,150
matches to a solution
here through a potential

1682
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:10,140
in between with continuity of
the derivative and anything

1683
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,900
else that's true of
that potential inside.

1684
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,810
All that S is doing
from that point of view

1685
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,610
is telling me how
these coefficients

1686
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,150
match onto these coefficients.

1687
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:18,480
Yes?

1688
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,960
Now what, for a bound state--
if we have e less than 0,

1689
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,510
what must be true?

1690
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:30,200
It must be true that AD is equal
to 0, and in particular, 00.

1691
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,310
So what are B and C?

1692
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:34,090

1693
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:37,000
Well, a matrix times
0 is equal to--

1694
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,790
AUDIENCE: 0.

1695
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:40,508
PROFESSOR: Unless?

1696
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:41,867
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1697
01:20:41,867 --> 01:20:45,170
PROFESSOR: Unless the
matrix itself is diverging,

1698
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,300
and then you have to be
more careful, but let's

1699
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,340
be naive for the moment.

1700
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:56,720
If A is 00, then in order
for B and C to be non-zero,

1701
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,650
S must have a pole.

1702
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:01,580

1703
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:05,120
S must go like 1 over 0.

1704
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,560
S must diverge at some
special value of the energy.

1705
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,389
Well, that's easy.

1706
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:11,930
That tells you that if you look
at any particular coefficient

1707
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:15,440
in S, any of the
matrix elements of S,

1708
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,940
the numerator can you whatever
you want, some finite number,

1709
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,740
but the denominator
had better be?

1710
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,600
AUDIENCE: 0.

1711
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,590
PROFESSOR: 0.

1712
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,830
So let's look at
the denominator.

1713
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:30,466
If I compute S21-- actually,
let me do this over here.

1714
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:32,890
No, it's all filled.

1715
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,280
Let's do it over here.

1716
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,060
If I look at S21 for
the potential well,

1717
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,530
scattering off
the potential well

1718
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:44,610
that we looked at at the
beginning of today's lecture,

1719
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,840
this guy, and now
I'm going to look

1720
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:51,420
at S21, one of the
coefficients of this guy,

1721
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,990
also known as the scattering
amplitude t for the well.

1722
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:58,870

1723
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:05,020
This is equal to-- and it's a
godawful expression-- 2 k1 k2

1724
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:12,210
e to the i k2 L over
2 k1 k2 cos of k

1725
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:18,920
prime L minus i k squared plus
k1 squared plus k2 squared

1726
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:24,910
times sine of k2 L. This
is some horrible thing.

1727
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:30,220
But now I ask the condition,
when does this have a pole?

1728
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,810
When the energy has
continued to be negative,

1729
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,650
for what values does
this have a pole

1730
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,410
or does the
denominator have a 0?

1731
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,170
And the answer is
if you take this

1732
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,780
and you massage
the equation, this

1733
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,753
is equal to 0 a little bit, you
get the following expression,

1734
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:53,870
k2 L upon 2 tangent of k2 L
upon 2 is equal to k1 L upon 2.

1735
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:56,310
This is the condition
for the bound state

1736
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,980
energies of the
square well, and we

1737
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:03,080
computed it using knowledge
only of the scattering states.

1738
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,320
If you took particles
and a square well

1739
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,180
and roll the particles across
the square well potential

1740
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,857
and measure it as a function
of energy, the scattering

1741
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:12,440
amplitude, the
transmission amplitude,

1742
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,720
and in particular S21, an
element of the S matrix,

1743
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,910
and you plotted it as
a function of energy,

1744
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:23,860
and then you approximated that
by a function of energy that

1745
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,196
satisfies the basic properties
of unitarity, what you would

1746
01:23:27,196 --> 01:23:28,570
find is that when
you then extend

1747
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,276
that function in
mathematica to minus

1748
01:23:31,276 --> 01:23:32,650
a particular value
of the energy,

1749
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:36,000
the denominator
diverges at that energy.

1750
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,912
You know that there
will be a bound state.

1751
01:23:38,912 --> 01:23:40,620
And so from scattering,
you've determined

1752
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,236
the existence of a bound state.

1753
01:23:42,236 --> 01:23:44,610
This is how we find an awful
lot of the particles that we

1754
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:49,050
actually deduce must
exist in the real world.

1755
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:52,050
We'll pick up next time.

1756
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,600
[APPLAUSE]

1757
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,826
