00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,900

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
PROFESSOR: Today,
what we want to do

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,720
is talk about something at a
much higher scale than what

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,100
we've thought about through
most of this semester.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,642
And that's probably by design.

14
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:32,100
Over the course of
the semester, we

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,300
started with kind
of enzyme kinetics

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,220
or molecular binding
kind of events,

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,680
and we slowly built our way up
the larger and larger scales.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,110
Now there's always this
question about whether we're

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,820
claiming that we really
understand how the higher

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,974
levels of organization
result from the lower level

21
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:50,515
interactions.

22
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:54,070
And I'd say, we definitely
don't understand all of it.

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,990
So you shouldn't come away
with that as the notion.

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,100
But at least one
thing that I think

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,690
is fascinating about this
area of systems biology

26
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,129
is that much of the framework
that we use to understand,

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,220
let's say, molecular scale
interactions or stochastic gene

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,420
expression, so these dynamics
at the smaller scale,

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,304
much of those ideas and
such certainly transport up

30
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:16,470
to these higher scales or
translate up to the higher

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,990
scales, where, in
this case, we're

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,900
using kind of master
equation type formulas

33
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,314
to try to understand
relative species abundance.

34
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:23,730
And so I think
part of what I like

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,420
about this topic of neutral
theory versus niche theory

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,780
and so forth in ecology
is that you can just

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,530
see how very, very similar
ideas, that we applied

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,400
for studying stochastic
gene expression,

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,358
can also be used to try
to understand why it is

40
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:41,800
that some species are more
common than others when you go

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,610
and you count them, in this
case, on an island in Panama.

42
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,230
Now, the subject
is, by its nature,

43
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,840
less experimentally
focused than much

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
of what we've done over
the course the semester.

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,680
And this is really
a topic the tends

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,200
to be a combination
of mathematical theory

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,680
with kind of careful counting of
species in some different areas

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,199
and trying to understand
what that means.

49
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,740
But it's an area
that there have been

50
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,880
a number of physicists involved
in over the last 10 years.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,690
And I think that
it's fascinating,

52
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,010
because it does get to the
heart of what we are looking

53
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,530
for from a theory,
what kind of evidence

54
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,040
do we use to support a
theory or to refute it.

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,272
So I think there are a lot of
very basic issues about science

56
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,730
that come up when
we start thinking

57
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,630
about this question of
neutral theory in ecology.

58
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,832
And since it's, for many
of us, a totally new area

59
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:36,290
that we don't know
very much about,

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,570
you can come to it
with maybe fresh eyes.

61
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,320
And you don't have the
same preconceptions

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,981
that you would have for many
other models that you might

63
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,230
be more familiar with in the
context of molecular cell

64
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,730
biology.

65
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,410

66
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,640
So the basic question
that we're going

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,610
to try to talk
about today is just

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,950
the question of why is it that,
when you look out at the world,

69
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,510
you see that there
are some species that

70
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,850
seem to be abundant and
some that seem to be rare?

71
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,350
Are there other patterns
that are somehow universal?

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,010
And what kind of sort
of lower scale processes

73
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,390
might lead to the
patterns that we observe?

74
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,220
And I think that this paper
that we read is-- I mean,

75
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,510
it's not that it's.

76
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,930
Well, can somebody say what the
actual scientific contribution

77
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,801
of this paper was?

78
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:34,300
Yes?

79
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,330
AUDIENCE: They
did a calculation.

80
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,940
PROFESSOR: They
did a calculation.

81
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,350
But it's a little bit
more specific than that.

82
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,850
What is it?

83
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,160
AUDIENCE: They came up with
the closed form equation?

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
PROFESSOR: That's right.

85
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,230
Basically, there was a model of
this neutral theory in ecology

86
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,920
that we're going to explain
or try to understand.

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
You can simulate the
model, but then there

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,700
are possible issues associated
with convergence or something

89
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,410
of those.

90
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,826
Although it's hard
to believe that

91
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,200
that's really such a concern.

92
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,970
But you can simulate that model.

93
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,680
What they did is
they just showed

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,919
that you could get an analytic-y
kind of expression for it.

95
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,460
It's not a super
analytic expression,

96
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,920
but, at least, it's not
a straight up simulation.

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,892
You kind of numerically
do something,

98
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,600
integrate something,
as compared to doing

99
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,683
the stochastic simulation.

100
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:17,844

101
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,510
So it's not that that,
in and of itself,

102
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,469
is what you feel like--
it's not what we necessarily

103
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:24,260
care so much about.

104
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,880
But I think that it's still
just a nice, short description

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,681
of the model and the
assumptions that go into it.

106
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,180
And you get a little
bit of a window

107
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,990
into the debate that's
going on between these two

108
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,910
communities of kind
of the neutral theory

109
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,780
guys and the niche
theory community.

110
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,650

111
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,080
So there's only one
figure in this paper.

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
And it's an example
of the kind of data

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,110
that we want to
try to understand.

114
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,330
So there's a particular
pattern in terms

115
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,400
of the relative
species abundance.

116
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,150
And we want to understand
what kind of models

117
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,280
might lead to that
observed pattern.

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,940
But given that there's just
one figure in the paper,

119
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,640
we have to make sure
that we understand

120
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,560
exactly what is being plotted.

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,210
And what I've found
from experience--

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,000
and, actually, even the
answer to the email question

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,514
that was sent out, I
think, was incorrect on one

124
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:20,180
of these things.

125
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,880
So we'll talk about
that some more.

126
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,587
So beware.

127
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:25,420
We'll figure it out.

128
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,040
But I think it's actually
surprisingly tricky

129
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,560
to understand what
this figure is saying.

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,020
But first of all, can
somebody describe not

131
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,620
what the figure is
saying but just what

132
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,160
the data is supposed to be?

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:56,550

134
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,640
Where do they get the data?

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,896
Anything that's useful?

136
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,692
AUDIENCE: They were on
an island ecosystem.

137
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:06,900
PROFESSOR: There's an island.

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,752
It's called BCI,
Barro Colorado Island.

139
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:13,668
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

140
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:25,080

141
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,015
PROFESSOR: So it's
a 50 hectare plot.

142
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:31,380

143
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,504
Does anybody know
what a hectare is?

144
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,420
AUDIENCE: It's a lot
more than a square meter.

145
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,550
PROFESSOR: It's a lot more than
a square meter, yes, indeed.

146
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah.

147
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,921
Is this an English
unit of measure?

148
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,920
This is the kind of thing
that I have to Google.

149
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,970
But it's one hectare is equal
to 10 to the 4 meters squared.

150
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,032

151
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:55,365
That's a good thing to memorize.

152
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:59,041

153
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,540
I

154
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,180
AUDIENCE: Exactly
or approximate?

155
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,430
PROFESSOR: I think it's exact.

156
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,680
I think I think it's an exact.

157
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,805
AUDIENCE: Then
it's a metric unit.

158
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so apparently
it is a metric unit.

159
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,150
So the idea is that if you take
a 100 meters by 100 meters,

160
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,070
this is a hectare.

161
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,080
And there's 50 of them.

162
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,435
It's about like a half
a square kilometer

163
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:21,110
to give you a sense of
what we're talking about.

164
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,331
And what do they
do on this plot?

165
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:28,930
AUDIENCE: They count a certain
number as canopy trees.

166
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,209
So the trees that
are, like, really big.

167
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,500
PROFESSOR: And how do they
decide which trees to count?

168
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,190
Did they count every tree?

169
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,890
AUDIENCE: No, just the ones
that like formed the top layer.

170
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,987
PROFESSOR: I think that the
way that they decide-- OK.

171
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:47,070
Does anybody remember how
many trees were counted?

172
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,283

173
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:51,660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

174
00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:06,390
PROFESSOR: So there are 21,457
trees in this 50 hectare plot.

175
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,770
They identify the species for
each one of these 21,000 trees.

176
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,670
And they assign them.

177
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,610
And they found that there
were 225 distinct species.

178
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,590

179
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,552
So this is really quite
an amazing data set.

180
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:27,960
Because I can tell you that I
would not be able to do this.

181
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,080

182
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,559
This was highly
skilled biologists

183
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,880
that can distinguish 225.

184
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,834
If they can identify
these 225, that

185
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,250
means they have to be able to
identify other ones as well.

186
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,340
And they did it
for 20,000 trees.

187
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,620
And indeed, Barro
Colorado Island

188
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,560
is one of the major Smithsonian
research institutes,

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,032
where they've been tracking.

190
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,740
They do this like
every five years or so,

191
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,630
where they do a census, where
they count all of the trees.

192
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,929
And they're also tracking many
other-- it's not just trees.

193
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,220
They're doing everything there.

194
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,512
AUDIENCE: Is there only plants?

195
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:09,470
PROFESSOR: What's that?

196
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,890
AUDIENCE: Is it only plants?

197
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,473
PROFESSOR: No.

198
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:16,090

199
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,285
So actually, I
visited BCI, and it

200
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,410
seemed like they were
studying all sorts of things.

201
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,760
And there were nice
looking birds there.

202
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,589
AUDIENCE: No, I
mean in this census.

203
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,380
PROFESSOR: In this
census, it's only trees.

204
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,150
And the way that they decide
which of the trees to do,

205
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,880
it's the ones that are more
than 10 centimeters DBH.

206
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,940
Anybody can guess
what DBH might mean?

207
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:50,050

208
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,240
It's actually diameter
at breast height.

209
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,908

210
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:05,925
So what they do is they walk
up to the tree with a ruler,

211
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,800
and then, if it's larger
than 10 centimeters,

212
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,020
then they count it.

213
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,200
You need to have some
threshold at the lower end,

214
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,140
otherwise you're
in trouble, right?

215
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,131
And there were plenty of trees
that satisfied this requirement

216
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:20,630
here.

217
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:27,380

218
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,420
Then what they do, for
all of these trees,

219
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,295
it's assigned to some species.

220
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:38,020

221
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,350
The basic goal of this
branch of biology or ecology

222
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,817
is to try to
understand the pattern,

223
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,650
from this sort of data,
where it comes from.

224
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,170
Or first describe
it, and then once you

225
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,950
have a description
of it, then you

226
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,377
can try to understand what
microscale processes might

227
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,210
lead to the pattern.

228
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,030
And the pattern is what's
plotted in figure 1.

229
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,610
It's the only
figure in the paper.

230
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,660
I have reconstructed
a rough version of it,

231
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,120
here, for you on the board.

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,960
But if you want a
more accurate version,

233
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,600
you can look at your paper.

234
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,120
Now, we want to make
sure that we understand

235
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,430
what the figure is saying.

236
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,880
So we will ask the
following question.

237
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,860
What is the most common
number of individuals

238
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,066
for a species in this data set?

239
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:30,040

240
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:39,660
The most common/frequent number
of individuals for a species

241
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:49,340
to have in this data set.

242
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,594
Now, it's maybe
worth just saying

243
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:52,760
something a little bit more.

244
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,710
So you notice that
they were not trying

245
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,780
to count the total number
of species, altogether.

246
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,426
And in general, all of this
field of relative species

247
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,467
abundance, to try to
understand them, what you do

248
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,792
is typically take
one trophic level.

249
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,250
So some of the
classic studies were

250
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,000
of beetles in the Thames River.

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,050
The idea is that it's
some set of species

252
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,850
that you think are
going to be interacting,

253
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,350
maybe competing,
with each other,

254
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,390
in some way, in the
sense that they're

255
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,180
maybe eating related things and
being eaten by related things.

256
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,070
And so in this case,
these are the trees

257
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,230
in Barro Colorado Island.

258
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,537
And you can imagine
that this is useful.

259
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:32,620
The fact that it's trees
instead of something else

260
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,251
means that you can actually
track the individuals

261
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:35,750
over time.

262
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,166
And when you go
to the island what

263
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,929
you see is that all the trees,
they're wrapped by some tag.

264
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,470
And presumably, they
have some system

265
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,590
to tell you which species
that is so that they

266
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,880
keep records of everything.

267
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,870
But the question is, what's
the most common number

268
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,790
of individuals for
species in the data set?

269
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,506
Do you understand what
I'm trying to ask?

270
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:03,960

271
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,120
And we're going do
approximate, so we'll say.

272
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:20,230

273
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,640
Or this, can't determine.

274
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:28,530

275
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,600
We want to know, what is the
mode of this distribution

276
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,360
of the number of individuals
for each of these species?

277
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,140

278
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,540
Do you understand the question?

279
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,220
I'm going to give you 20
seconds to look at this.

280
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:55,659

281
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,110
AUDIENCE: Should we just
hold a blank piece of paper?

282
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,516
PROFESSOR: Oh, we
don't have our-- ah.

283
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:02,310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

284
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,530
PROFESSOR: You know, the
TA always lets me down.

285
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,310
All right, yeah.

286
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,634
So you can do A, B,
C, D, E. Are we ready?

287
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

288
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:21,570

289
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,680
PROFESSOR: You can just
do this if you're not.

290
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,100
But given this was the
only figure in the paper,

291
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,470
and that this is a basic
property of the distribution,

292
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,407
I'm sure that you figured that
out last night, anyways, right?

293
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:33,240
Especially since it was
one of the questions

294
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,031
in the [INAUDIBLE].

295
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,410
So you presumably already
thought about this question,

296
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:36,940
right?

297
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,430
OK.

298
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,253
Yes?

299
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

300
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,725
PROFESSOR: Ready,
three, two, one.

301
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:47,590

302
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,060
I'd say we got a lot of B's.

303
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,935
So it seems like B is the most.

304
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,284

305
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,950
So this, we'll put a
question mark here.

306
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,860

307
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,440
Can somebody verbally
say why their neighbor

308
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,740
said that the mode of the
distribution is around 30?

309
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,810

310
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,427
Yeah?

311
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:13,510
AUDIENCE: The tallest bar.

312
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,620
PROFESSOR: The tallest
bar there is around 30.

313
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,270
That's a very
practical definition.

314
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,240
So that's normally what
we mean by the mode.

315
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,550
There is a slight
problem in all of this,

316
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,520
which is that this
thing is plotted

317
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,415
in a very kind of funny way.

318
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:30,290
So if you look at the
figure, what you'll see

319
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,748
is that it's number
of individuals.

320
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,375
And down here, it
says, log2 scale.

321
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:40,610

322
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,530
Now, when we say the mode,
what we're wondering about

323
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:50,080
is that, if you just take the
most typical kind of species

324
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
of tree that's there,
how many individuals do

325
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,371
we think there should be there?

326
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,570

327
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,560
Of course, typical
is hard to define.

328
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,650
We can talk about mode,
median, mean, et cetera.

329
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,210
But the most common
number of individuals

330
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,890
for a species of the data
set ends up not being 30.

331
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,190
It ends up being 1.

332
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,220

333
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,430
And we will try to
reconstruct this right now.

334
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,870
Because you have to do
a little bit of digging

335
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,330
to figure out what is
being plotted here.

336
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,340
But it's not the raw data.

337
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,360
The problem here is that this
is on this log scale, where

338
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,720
the bins here are growing
kind of geometrically

339
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,310
or exponentially, whatever,
as you move to the right.

340
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,975
So over here, this thing
only contains one real bin.

341
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,350
And actually,
we're about to find

342
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,040
it's half a bin,
which is even weirder.

343
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,330
Whereas out here,
this is maybe 30 bins.

344
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,550
So the number of species that
we're going to put in this bin

345
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,990
is everything between around
20 something up to 50 or so.

346
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,701
The number of kind
of true bins that

347
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,200
end up in each of
these plotted bins

348
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,480
is going to grow geometrically
as we move to the right.

349
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,730
So this is a very funny
transform of the data.

350
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,690
And indeed, I think it's
always nice to just, in life,

351
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,890
you always plot
the raw data first.

352
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,720
And then what you can do
is then you can do funny.

353
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,510
There's a reason to
plot it this way.

354
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,770
Because this is where they
get this idea that this might

355
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,530
described as described
as a log normal.

356
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,550
The idea is, if you
take a log of the data,

357
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,550
then you get something
that looks like a normal.

358
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,105
But you always plot
the raw data first.

359
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:40,480
So let's try to figure out
what the raw data looked like.

360
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,260

361
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,680
And now what we're
going to do is

362
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,141
we're going to have real
scalings, honest to goodness

363
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:49,640
numbers.

364
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,130

365
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,170
Now the number of
species you get still.

366
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,800

367
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,580
So this is asking, how
many different species

368
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,100
do we see with one member
or with two members

369
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,980
or with three, four, et cetera?

370
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,715

371
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,340
And I don't know how
far we're actually

372
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,860
going to be able to get.

373
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,440
But in this one
figure, in our paper,

374
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,640
they tell us what
the histogram means.

375
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,600
So the first histogram
bar represents what

376
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,680
they call phi 1 divided by 2.

377
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,920
Phi 1 was the number of species
observed with one member, which

378
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,980
means that even this
first plot bar is not

379
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,940
the number of species observed
with a single individual.

380
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,810
It's half of that.

381
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,350
You can argue about
the consistency

382
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,230
of how these things
should be, but that's

383
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,000
what this thing's plotted.

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And it looks like it was nine,
here, so this should be 18.

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,500
So I'm going to put up here,
here's a 20 and here's a 10.

386
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,950

387
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,140
Right, so here is an 18.

388
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:14,510

389
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,670
Now, what do they say?

390
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,270
This bin represents
phi 1 divided

391
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,894
by 2 plus phi 2 divided by 2.

392
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,310
So they took the
number of species

393
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,940
where they saw just a single
individual plus the number

394
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,690
of species where they
saw two individuals,

395
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,829
and they added those
and they divided by 2.

396
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:36,620
That's this number.

397
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,799

398
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,840
We're not going to go
through this whole process,

399
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,350
because it's a
little bit tiresome.

400
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,410
But I've already
done it for you.

401
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,670
So I'm going to plot a few
of things to get you there.

402
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:58,240

403
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,490
And so I calculated
it was 19, 13, 9, 6.

404
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,696
It becomes ill-determined
once you get out here,

405
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,320
in the sense that we
don't have enough.

406
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,240
It's not uniquely specified
going from that to that

407
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,980
as it has to be.

408
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,970
But I calculated it.

409
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,565
It's around 5, in
here, for a few.

410
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:21,120
And somewhere in here,
it's going to go into 4.

411
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,095
And then this might go down
to 3, and then deh, deh, deh.

412
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:32,550

413
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:42,950
Now, if you look at this and
the rapid rapid fall-off,

414
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,665
do you think that you're
going to find any species that

415
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:47,915
have more than 20 individuals?

416
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:51,440

417
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,340
We're going to vote.

418
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,857
So you see this falling-off?

419
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,690
So let's say that I've
just showed you this,

420
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,930
and I haven't yet
calculated the rest,

421
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,540
do we think that there's going
to be any species with more

422
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,230
than 20 individuals?

423
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,430
Greater than 20
individuals, question mark?

424
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,760
1 is yes.

425
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,245
2 is no.

426
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,945

427
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:16,230
It's going to be yes, no.

428
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,835
Ready, three, two, one.

429
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:21,560

430
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,190
So we got some 2s.

431
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,300
So I'd say that most
people are saying, no.

432
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,532
Look at this fall-off.

433
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:29,990
They're not going
to be any species

434
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,480
with more than 20 individuals.

435
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,630
Although we already
know that there

436
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,480
are many species with
more than 20 individuals.

437
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,930
So this plot is
useful for something.

438
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,560
You can see that there are.

439
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,450
And we know exactly
the number of species

440
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,930
that have more than 20
individuals, roughly.

441
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,760
So those ones are all in these.

442
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,985
So you can see that there
are hundreds of species

443
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:54,235
with more than 20 individuals.

444
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:57,630

445
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,830
And indeed, it looks like there
were two or three species that

446
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,186
had more than 1,000
individuals or 1,500

447
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:04,560
or whatever the
cutoff there was.

448
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,920

449
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:14,050
So this distribution
starts out rather high

450
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,590
but then falls quickly.

451
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,019
And out here, it's going
to be very, very sparse.

452
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,060
So there's going to be a
bunch of numbers in here

453
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,160
where there's not any
species in the histogram.

454
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,340
And then out there, there's
going to be one, right?

455
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,680
And indeed, you have
to go really far out.

456
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,490
Because there's one
species out there

457
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,870
that has a couple thousand.

458
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:40,660
And indeed, the mean number
of individuals per species

459
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,880
has to be around 100.

460
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,160
We know how to calculate a mean.

461
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,810
This divided by this
is just short of 100.

462
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,150
So the mean number of
individuals in a species

463
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,280
is around 100.

464
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,090
The mode is one.

465
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,446

466
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,070
And the median?

467
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:08,630

468
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,200
Well, ready?

469
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,387
We decided this was the mode.

470
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:15,720
Where is the median going to be?

471
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,260
Is it going to be A, B, C, D?

472
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,935
Ready, three, two, one.

473
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:23,760

474
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,060
Indeed, this tells you pretty
clear where the median is.

475
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,854
This thing is indeed
around the median.

476
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:31,020
Because you can say, oh,
it's about the same numbers

477
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,240
to either side.

478
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,740
So the median is around here.

479
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,310

480
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,370
And I told you where
the mean was, again.

481
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,330
You guys remember?

482
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,710
Ready, three, two, one.

483
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,960
Mean, uno.

484
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,460
Mean.

485
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,220

486
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,070
So this is a very, very
funny distribution.

487
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,730
I guess I want to
highlight that.

488
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,530
And I think it's
not at all what you

489
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,070
would have expected somehow.

490
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,799
At least, if you had described
this measurement process to me,

491
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,590
if you told me that
you went to this island

492
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,545
and you counted 20,000 trees,
I don't know how many species

493
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:11,420
I would have guessed.

494
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,255
But OK, 220, it's reasonable.

495
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,630
Well, I would have guessed it
would have looked something

496
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,380
like this on a linear
scale, maybe, right?

497
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,430
You know, that there would be a
bunch of them around 50 to 100

498
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,340
and some would go couple
hundred, some of them.

499
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,480
So I guess I would have
thought that the mean, mode,

500
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,070
median would all be kind
of a more similar thing.

501
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,130
But this is just not
the way the world is.

502
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,230
It's not just on BCI.

503
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,150
People, for hundreds
of years, have been

504
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,520
studying these distributions.

505
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,100
And things that look like this,
with extremely long tails,

506
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,810
this is what people see.

507
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,720
Now you can argue about
exactly how fast it falls off

508
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
and whether it's different
on a mainland or an island.

509
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,210
But this basic feature, that
rare species are common,

510
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,140
this seems to be just
that's what you always see.

511
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,220
This is the thing that
you have to remember,

512
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,425
rare species are common.

513
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:24,520

514
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,680
And I think that this is
the basic, surprising thing

515
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,530
in this whole field.

516
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,480
And the ironic
thing is that even

517
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,580
after spending all this
time reading about theories

518
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,140
to describe these distributions,
it's still very possible--

519
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,780
and I would say, based on
the statistics, this year

520
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,380
and past years, it's
not just possible,

521
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,060
but it is the
standard outcome-- is

522
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,476
that after reading
this paper, you

523
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:51,230
do not realize that the
distribution looks like this.

524
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,000
You somehow still think that
it looks-- you kind of still

525
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,060
think it's like a linear scale,
where the typical species has

526
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,130
this, where the mean,
median, mode are all

527
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,260
about the same thing.

528
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,661
So I guess always plot the raw
data in an untransformed way.

529
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,410
There are theoretical
reasons why it might

530
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,618
be nice to plot it like this.

531
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:15,120
But be very careful
about what you're doing.

532
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,965
Because then you're left with
a mental image of a histogram

533
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:19,850
that looks like this.

534
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,640
And that's very, very dangerous.

535
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,140
Yeah?

536
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,570
AUDIENCE: Why does it
matter [INAUDIBLE]?

537
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,000
[INAUDIBLE] the aggregate
data in bins like that.

538
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,150
And I mean, sure, exactly
one species is the mode,

539
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,619
but do you really want the--?

540
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:37,410
PROFESSOR: I understand
what you're saying.

541
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:42,240

542
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,090
It's just that there's
a qualitative aspect

543
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,510
to the data, which is that
most species are very rare.

544
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,630
And this is something that
I think is surprising.

545
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,410
I think it's deep.

546
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,120
And it's something that
you do not get realized.

547
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,368
AUDIENCE: Most species
have more than 16.

548
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,024
I mean, it depends
what you mean by rare.

549
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:03,690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

550
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,108
AUDIENCE: Look at the way
that the distribution is away

551
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:07,268
from trend.

552
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,518
AUDIENCE: That's a good point.

553
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:10,687
But the species
density is clustered

554
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:11,962
around the low numbers.

555
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:12,670
PROFESSOR: Right.

556
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,920
AUDIENCE: But actually most
species have more than 30.

557
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,679

558
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,220
PROFESSOR: Maybe
the surprising thing

559
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,260
is that just if you
take-- the mean is 100.

560
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:33,440
And so I would've thought that,
if you plot number of species

561
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:41,650
as a function of the
number of individuals,

562
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,290
given those numbers, I would
have guessed, OK, here's 100.

563
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,480
I would have guessed--
here's 50, so just

564
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,130
to highlight that this is 150.

565
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,620
So linear scale, I
would have guessed

566
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,820
it would look something like
that, maybe larger than Rudin

567
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,889
or something.

568
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,055
AUDIENCE: What would that
look like in a log2 scale?

569
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:03,951
It would look like It's
like the log of [INAUDIBLE]?

570
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,460
So it goes up really
fast and then--

571
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,730
PROFESSOR: So this thing
would be kind of like shoom.

572
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,070
I mean all the
weight would be in.

573
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,988
It would be like all here plus
a little bit on each of these.

574
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,884
AUDIENCE: But yeah.

575
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:21,730
I don't think it's
actually that different.

576
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,340
The only thing that's different
is the tail on the left.

577
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,092
PROFESSOR: And the
tail on the right.

578
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:27,800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
a little bit longer.

579
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,383
PROFESSOR: No, it's
lot longer, right?

580
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:33,530
Because this thing, all of the
weight is between 50 and 150,

581
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,740
which means that
all of the counts

582
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,124
are basically going to
be these two, basically.

583
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:42,790
Because this thing
comes out either way.

584
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,240
So in this case, if you
take that histogram put it

585
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,560
on this kind of scale,
you end up with two bars

586
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,717
up high, nothing outside.

587
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:52,300
So it's a very
different distribution.

588
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,330
And it's not to say that this
is a ridiculous thing to do.

589
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,230
It's just that.

590
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,610
But the problem is
that your mental image

591
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,930
of what the distribution
looks like ends up

592
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,910
being incorrect, in
the sense that you

593
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,040
have a qualitatively different
sense of what's of what's

594
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,690
going on.

595
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,260
And if you go up to 10 species,
here, and 10 is way down here.

596
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,589

597
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,130
If this is what it
looked like, there

598
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,970
would be essentially no species
with fewer than 10 individuals.

599
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,780
But if you come over here
and you add it up here.

600
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,740
It's like a mean of 6
times 10 is 60 out of 200.

601
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,830
A quarter or a third of the
species on this plot of land

602
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,450
have fewer than 10 individuals.

603
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,515
And 10 is really a
very small number.

604
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:43,810

605
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,590
Well, rare species are common.

606
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,170
I think it's a true description
of the observed distribution

607
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,180
here and elsewhere.

608
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,620
And it's not something
that you appreciate

609
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,911
or realize when you
plot it in that way.

610
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:01,522
AUDIENCE: But you can get this
information from that plot.

611
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:02,480
PROFESSOR: No, I agree.

612
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,440
You can get it.

613
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,290
You can get it.

614
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,280
But it was only 10%
of the group got it.

615
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,430
Right, the fact that you can
get it-- right, it's possible.

616
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,370
But you don't get it.

617
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,680
That is a practical statement.

618
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,150
Yeah, I'm not dead set
against this distribution.

619
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,737
It's just that it
makes everybody think

620
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,820
something that's not true.

621
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,430
So if you think that that's
OK, then I can't help you.

622
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,670

623
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,690
It's OK, but it's
just you have to be

624
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,300
careful is my only statement.

625
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,550
And I very much want
you to take away.

626
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,800
Because I this is an accurate
description of the data.

627
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,270
Rare species are common.

628
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,360
And one of the readings-- I
think it was in this paper,

629
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,640
maybe it was a different
one that I was reading.

630
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,300
Even Darwin, when talking about
this, commented on this fact

631
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,820
that rarity of species is
somehow a typical event.

632
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,700
AUDIENCE: And common
species are rare.

633
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,160
PROFESSOR: And common species
are rare, that's right.

634
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,720
This distribution is
hugely, hugely skewed.

635
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:14,986

636
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,110
These are the measurements.

637
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,731

638
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:20,730
It's good to look at them
in both of these ways.

639
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,950
Because you can't even plot
the data on a linear scale.

640
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,020
So that's a good
reason for doing it.

641
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,350
But I think it's good to have
both of these pictures in mind.

642
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:38,680

643
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,960
What we want to do is to talk
about two classes of models

644
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,110
that give something
that's essentially

645
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,620
this log normal distribution.

646
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,350
So on a log scale it looks
normally distributed,

647
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,130
approximately.

648
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,640
And those two models
are going to be

649
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,610
kind of a niche-based
model and a neutral model.

650
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,460
Can somebody, in words,
explain what they maybe

651
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,200
see as the difference
between this niche

652
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,800
and a neutral kind of approach?

653
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:21,768

654
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:22,349
Yeah?

655
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

656
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:26,255

657
00:32:26,255 --> 00:32:27,505
PROFESSOR: Every species is--?

658
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

659
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,846
PROFESSOR: In which one?

660
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:31,130
AUDIENCE: In niche.

661
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,340
PROFESSOR: In the niche theory,
the species are different.

662
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,450
So it seems like a
ridiculous statement.

663
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,380
Do you believe that
species are different?

664
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,200
We can vote, yes or no.

665
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,150
Ready, three, two, one.

666
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,800
Yeah.

667
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,330
Well, somebody's been convinced
by the neutral theory.

668
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,760
It's clear that
species are different.

669
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,390
And the question is which
patterns in the data

670
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,340
do you need to
invoke differences

671
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,890
in order to explain?

672
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,050
And I think that one,
maybe, theme that's

673
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,640
come out of this relative
species abundance literature

674
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,110
and the debates between the
neutral and the niche guys

675
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,390
is just that this
distribution is

676
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,310
less informative
of the micro scale

677
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,240
or individual kind
of interactions

678
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,640
then you might have thought.

679
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,290
Because multiple
models can adequately

680
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,050
explain such a pattern.

681
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,220
In all areas, we
have to remember

682
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,530
that you make an observation,
and you write down a model

683
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,892
that explains that observation.

684
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:42,600
So what you do is you
write down a model.

685
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,040
And writing down a
model, what that means

686
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,010
is that you make some
set of assumptions.

687
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,176
And then you look to see
what happens in that model.

688
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:53,555
And if the model is consistent
with the data, that's good.

689
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:55,680
But it doesn't prove that
the assumptions that went

690
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,804
into the model are correct.

691
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,475
And this is a trivial statement.

692
00:33:58,475 --> 00:33:59,475
And I've said it before.

693
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:01,839

694
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,880
You have to tell yourself
this or remind yourself

695
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,580
of this kind of once a month.

696
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,970
Because it's just such an
easy thing to forget about.

697
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,090

698
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,420
Now, the niche
models indeed assume

699
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,190
that the species are different.

700
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,840
And that's reasonable.

701
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,687
Because we think it's true.

702
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,770
But then, of course, there
are many different ways

703
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,550
of capturing those differences.

704
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,600
And then you have to decide
whether the assumptions there

705
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,030
are reasonable or whether
they're necessary, essential.

706
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,170
In the context of
the niche models,

707
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,500
we're going to think about the
so-called broken stick models.

708
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:52,510

709
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,219
So basically, you get
log normal distributions

710
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,320
when there's some sort of
multiplicative-type random

711
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,260
process that's being
added together.

712
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,930
You get normal
distributions when

713
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,794
you have sums of random
things going together.

714
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:07,210
This is the central
limit theorem.

715
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,560
But when you have
multiplicative kind

716
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,895
of errors or random
processes coming together,

717
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:14,270
you get log normal
distributions.

718
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,650
And I want to highlight that
that does not necessarily

719
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,720
have to tell you so much
about the biology of it.

720
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,540
Because a classic
situation where you get log

721
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:35,590
normal distributions is if you
take a stone and you crush it.

722
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:41,220

723
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,350
You can do this
experiment at home.

724
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,930
And then you measure the mass
distribution of the resulting

725
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,430
fragments.

726
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:55,390

727
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:00,050
And the distribution
of mass is log normal.

728
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,210

729
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:13,280
Just take a stone, grind it
under your boot or hammer it,

730
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,030
just kind rub it right in.

731
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,230
You'll get you'll get some
distribution of fragments.

732
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,950
For each of the fragments,
measure the mass, and, indeed,

733
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,930
you end up getting a
log normal distribution.

734
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,930
Because there's some sense
that what's happening

735
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,260
is that you take a larger
mass, you break it up randomly,

736
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,490
and then the resulting
fragments, at some rate,

737
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,270
each of them you
break up randomly.

738
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,770
and the small ones
are maybe kind of

739
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,644
less likely to get broken
up as the big ones,

740
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:38,232
so then the small ones can
still get even smaller.

741
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,690
But then there's going to be,
at some rate, some very large

742
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,060
ones.

743
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,880
So such a process ends up--
I mean it's not biology.

744
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,660
This is just something about
the nature of the breaking

745
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,990
up of this physical object.

746
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,160
And indeed, the basic
idea behind many

747
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,630
of the niche models that give
you a log normal distribution

748
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,270
is equivalent to
crushing a stone

749
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,910
and measuring the
resulting distribution.

750
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,670
I'll describe what
I mean by that.

751
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,120
Typically, the
broken stick models,

752
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,140
they say there's
some resource axis.

753
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,300
This is a resource axis.

754
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,430
And this could be, for example,
where you're getting food from.

755
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,570
Now, we're going to have
to divide up this resource

756
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,615
access among some number
of different species.

757
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:29,990
And what we're
going to assume is

758
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,120
that the number of
individuals in the species

759
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,460
is proportional to the
length of the resource axis

760
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,698
that it's able to capture.

761
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:39,450

762
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,150
And I want to make
sure I find my notes.

763
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,275
I want to highlight this.

764
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:53,600
This comes from
MacArthur in the 1950s.

765
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,480
MacArthur and it's 1957.

766
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,780
So we imagine there's this
homogeneous resource axis.

767
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,600
We're going to break
it up into N segments.

768
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,860
And the abundances are
proportional to the length.

769
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,690
And the idea is that, if you
just break this up randomly,

770
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,150
so let's say you just draw
N minus 1 lines randomly,

771
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,290
or N minus 1 points
randomly here.

772
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:27,775
Now you have N species with
N different abundances.

773
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,480

774
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,360
The question is does
that give a log normal?

775
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,160

776
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,495
We'll say N minus
1 random points.

777
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:41,084

778
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,377
Do you understand what I mean.

779
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:44,460
You sample uniformly once,
sample uniformly twice.

780
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,220
You do that N minus 1 times,
and now you have N and deh deh.

781
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,130
And then we say, OK,
the first species

782
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,230
has this many individuals.

783
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,790
The second has this one.

784
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,230
The third is this
one, et cetera.

785
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,589
The question is
does random points,

786
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,880
does that lead to a log normal?

787
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,400

788
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,380
Yes and no.

789
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,250
Let's think about
this for 10 seconds.

790
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:20,030
N minus 1 random points,
log normal distribution,

791
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,115
ready, three, two, one.

792
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:26,320

793
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,200
So I'd say that we have
a majority are saying no.

794
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,610
Can somebody say why that is?

795
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

796
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,440
PROFESSOR: Because
it's something else.

797
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,900
That's fair.

798
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,865
But can you say
qualitatively why it is

799
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:43,682
that this is not going to work?

800
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:48,632
AUDIENCE: You can't
have very long gaps.

801
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:49,340
PROFESSOR: Right.

802
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,256
That is it's going to
be very unusual that you

803
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:53,310
get a very long gap.

804
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,510
What about the other end?

805
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,064
AUDIENCE: Also a very long tail.

806
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,730
PROFESSOR: Now I'm a
little bit worried.

807
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,040

808
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,460
I think that that's true, right?

809
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,640

810
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,910
Well, I'm going to say
that you're not going

811
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,140
to get this super long ones.

812
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,810
I think that the
distribution might still

813
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,500
be peaked at short values.

814
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,230
No?

815
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,550
AUDIENCE: No.

816
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,510
PROFESSOR: Random?

817
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,236
If we were just traveling
along this resource axis,

818
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:34,360
at a rate that's kind of
exponentially distributed,

819
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,480
like Poisson rate,
we just dropped

820
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,635
points, that's something
very similar to this random--

821
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:43,167
AUDIENCE: It said we're
limited in the number--

822
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:43,750
PROFESSOR: No.

823
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,604
Is that not true?

824
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:47,020
AUDIENCE: Your
sample [INAUDIBLE].

825
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,030

826
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,310
PROFESSOR: I'm a little bit
worried that I might be-- now,

827
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm not 100% confident.

828
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,361
Depending on how I look at this,
I get different distributions.

829
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah?

830
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,716
AUDIENCE: But I think the
first thing that he said,

831
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,465
where you just say, I'm going
to pick N minus 1 points--

832
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,090
PROFESSOR: Yes.

833
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,940
AUDIENCE: --is a different
thing than going along the axis

834
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,320
and exponentially
dropping ones along.

835
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,021
PROFESSOR: I agree
it's different.

836
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,395
AUDIENCE: I don't think that
would be the idea simulated,

837
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:22,093
because you would be
very likely to just get

838
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,134
this giant thing at the
end when you're finished.

839
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:26,120
AUDIENCE: What you could
do, you could go on

840
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,830
to draft N plus 2 points.

841
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,830
PROFESSOR: No, I think--

842
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,125
AUDIENCE: These scales that
are your two end points

843
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:33,980
[? are doubled. ?]

844
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,938
PROFESSOR: Because I
think that the probability

845
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:37,310
distribution does grow.

846
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,370
I think that I'm going
to side with you.

847
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,190
So we've decided
that there are not

848
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,315
going to be as
many short sticks,

849
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,190
and there's not going
to be as long sticks as

850
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,231
compared to a log normal.

851
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:48,226
Do we agree with that?

852
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:51,205

853
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:53,580
At least we agree that it's
not going to be a log normal.

854
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,496
So you're not going to
get this huge variation

855
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:59,230
of some very long sticks
and some very short ones.

856
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,710
Now, the question is how would
you change this sort of model

857
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,581
in order to generate
a log normal?

858
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,330
And the answer is that
what you have to do

859
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,980
is you have to what is called
some niche hierarchy or so

860
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,690
some hierarchical breaking.

861
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,040
Just like what led to the
stone giving you a log normal

862
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,100
is that you have to have
some successive process

863
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,810
of breaking things.

864
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,190
So this is what they call
some hierarchy model.

865
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:27,225

866
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,225
And then they key thing
is that it's sequential.

867
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:33,260

868
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,060
You have your resource axis.

869
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,661
First, you have some
rule for breaking it up.

870
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:41,410
It could be that you
just sample uniformly

871
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,034
or some other
probability distribution.

872
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:45,089

873
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,880
And the way that you
might think about this

874
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:57,020
is via-- just everything
up on the board

875
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,270
is so nice and useful.

876
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,430
I feel bad getting rid of it.

877
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:06,170
This thing is not true, so
I don't mind erasing it.

878
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,560
So let's imagine some bird
community in the forest.

879
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,260

880
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,770
And we're going to
think about where

881
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,336
is it that the birds are
getting their grub or their food

882
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:18,836
to eat.

883
00:43:18,836 --> 00:43:21,530

884
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:27,620
First, well, now the
axis is somehow vertical.

885
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:35,210
You could divide them up
into the ground foragers

886
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,730
as compared to the tree
foragers in terms of where

887
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,971
they're getting their food.

888
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:43,470
And you say, oh, well, how much
of the food is on each side?

889
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,850
Oh, well, we'll say 30% is on
the ground, 70% is on the tree.

890
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,889
This is along the stick.

891
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,430
You cut the stick
in some way, or you

892
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,530
break the stick in some way.

893
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,060
But then within
the tree foragers,

894
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,110
you'd say, well, the
resources might be separated.

895
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,750
And this is really
like speciation,

896
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,690
a species is in the
niche, the species

897
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,300
are focusing on
different niches.

898
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,030
So you'd say, oh, some are
going to focus on the trunk,

899
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,330
some will focus on branches.

900
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,950
And again, this
part of the stick

901
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,720
is now broken or divided among
different resource locations

902
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,885
with some amount.

903
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:21,855
But then also, you're
going to get speciation

904
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:23,730
in different directions
here, because there's

905
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,590
both the surface-- I don't
know if you guys have ever

906
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,200
eaten grubs-- but there's
the surface grubs,

907
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,665
and then there's also
the sub-bark grubs.

908
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:38,100

909
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,230
And so you kind of do this
process multiple times,

910
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,650
where you kind of pick
different branches

911
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,020
and break them to
divide up the niche.

912
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,972
And then you end up with a
log normal type distribution.

913
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:54,840
And this is a similar process
to the crushing of the stone,

914
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:01,870
because the idea is that there's
sequential breaks of the stone.

915
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,980
So the stone first breaks
into maybe simply two

916
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,474
or it could be three.

917
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:07,640
First, there's one breaking.

918
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,400
And then one of
them is broken more.

919
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,924
So given this
process, you end up

920
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:13,340
getting a log
normal distribution.

921
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,334
Yeah.

922
00:45:14,334 --> 00:45:18,640
AUDIENCE: But you also have a
distribution of like how far.

923
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,340
Because I guess there
are two questions.

924
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,620
Like when you break your
stick, you assume, somehow,

925
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,154
that you uniformly break it.

926
00:45:25,154 --> 00:45:25,820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

927
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,050

928
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:31,290
A lot of work has gone
into the question of how it

929
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,330
is you should break the stick.

930
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,390
Given that you have this
tree foraging stick.

931
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,160

932
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,840
On a practical level,
what they do is

933
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,140
they ask, well, what probability
distribution gives you the best

934
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,490
agreement with the data?

935
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,860
Is it uniform?

936
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,160
Or is it, oh, it's
broken like this?

937
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,490
And in some cases
people say, well, it's

938
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,055
actually tilted on one side.

939
00:45:54,055 --> 00:46:00,900

940
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,770
Well, in the context
of a succession

941
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,350
and some other
environments, there's

942
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,660
an idea that, if a species
first gets somewhere,

943
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,790
they can kind of
monopolize a larger

944
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,630
fraction of the resources
then if it's divided kind

945
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,922
of an equally at the beginning.

946
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:15,505
And that's going to effect where
this probability distribution

947
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,150
is going to break each one.

948
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:23,580
But there's always this
question about how constrained

949
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,080
are the notions and so forth.

950
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,384
And I'm agnostic on that point.

951
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:31,016
AUDIENCE: But you also need
distribution for how many times

952
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:33,440
it breaks [INAUDIBLE].

953
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

954
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,054
It's just that, if
you do this process,

955
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:39,970
it's like a central limit
theorem type result.

956
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,010
So you have to do it enough
times so that you get

957
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:43,260
to some limiting distribution.

958
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,120
And then you could
keep on doing it.

959
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,120
In the end, we always say
that species abundance

960
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,190
is proportional to the size.

961
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,520
So we're going to
scale, ultimately,

962
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,360
to get the correct
number of individuals.

963
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,130
It's just that you have to do it
some reasonable number of times

964
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,880
so that the randomness
kind of washes out,

965
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,963
and you end up approaching
that limiting behavior.

966
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:04,095

967
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:04,970
Does that make sense?

968
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,480

969
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,690
And indeed I just want
to mention a major result

970
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,840
in this field.

971
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,360

972
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:23,760
These niche type
models successfully

973
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,692
explained or predicted
another pattern

974
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:30,150
that had been observed, which
is the so-called species area

975
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,733
relationships.

976
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:39,440

977
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,570
So this is just saying that,
here, we looked at 50 hectares,

978
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,610
and we asked how many
species where there.

979
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,550
225 species in 50 hectares.

980
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,550
Now, the question is, if instead
of looking at 50 hectares,

981
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:54,082
we instead looked
at 500, do you think

982
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,790
of that the number of
species we observed

983
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:01,538
would have gone up, stayed
the same, or gone down?

984
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:07,936
Up, same, down, ready,
three, two, one.

985
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:08,880
Up.

986
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,830
Up.

987
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,660
If you look at a
larger area, you

988
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,170
expect to see more
species in a larger area.

989
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,890
And people really do this.

990
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,070
They look in some area, going
from, say, they take a meter,

991
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,450
and they count all the species.

992
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,530
And then they go and
here is 100 meters,

993
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,060
and they count all the species.

994
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,190
And they ask, how
many species do you

995
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,440
see as a function of the area?

996
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,773
And what people have found
is that the number of species

997
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:42,580
you observe it is proportional
to the area to some power,

998
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,790
where Z is around a 1/4.

999
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:52,036

1000
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:55,584
And of course, the area
goes as some r squared.

1001
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:57,000
If you wanted to,
you could say it

1002
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
goes as the square root
of the radius, whatever.

1003
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,670
But the number
species in some area,

1004
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,100
it grows, but it
grows in a manner

1005
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,870
that is less than linear.

1006
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,349
Does that make sense?

1007
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,390
It definitely makes sense
that's less the linear.

1008
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,302
Because linear would be that you
sample a bunch of species here,

1009
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:19,135
and then you look at
another identical plot,

1010
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:20,125
you get some other species.

1011
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,583
And they were saying that, oh,
that you really don't expect

1012
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,400
any of those species overlap.

1013
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,420
That would be a weird world.

1014
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,390
So it very much make sense
that this is less than 1.

1015
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,550
Of course, it didn't have
to be this power law.

1016
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,010
But one thing that has been
discovered, around the world,

1017
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,050
is that power laws
are very interesting.

1018
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:45,810
But once again, many different
microscopic processes

1019
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,200
can lead to power laws.

1020
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,270
The niche models
have successfully

1021
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,290
predicted or explained why
it might have this scaling.

1022
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,400
But it turns out that neutral
models can also predict it.

1023
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,490
And may just be that lots
of spatially explicit models

1024
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,520
will give you some power
law type scaling that

1025
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,589
looks kind of like this.

1026
00:50:04,589 --> 00:50:06,130
So once again, it's
a question of how

1027
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,162
convinced you should be
about microscopic processes

1028
00:50:09,162 --> 00:50:10,870
based on being able
to explain some data.

1029
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:17,880
And I think the best
cure for this danger,

1030
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,480
of assuming that the microscopic
assumptions are correct,

1031
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,438
because the model is able
to explain something,

1032
00:50:22,438 --> 00:50:25,010
is that, if you find some
other very different set

1033
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,629
of microscopic assumptions that
also explain the patterns, then

1034
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,670
it becomes clear that you
have to take everything

1035
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,496
with a grain of salt.

1036
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:34,870
And that's I think
part of what's

1037
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,270
been very valuable about the
neutral theory contribution

1038
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,010
to this field.

1039
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,179
AUDIENCE: Does this
just come from-- you

1040
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:44,312
assume that all the individuals
are uniformly distributed

1041
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:45,758
and then [INAUDIBLE]?

1042
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:50,997

1043
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:53,080
PROFESSOR: There are
multiple derivations of this,

1044
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,371
so it's a little bit confusing.

1045
00:50:54,371 --> 00:51:03,135

1046
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:05,500
The neutral models,
that I have seen,

1047
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,780
that lead to these
patterns, they basically

1048
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,510
have the individuals
randomly, either

1049
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,490
with sex or without sex,
kind of diffusing around,

1050
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,640
and then they divide, deh-deh.

1051
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,190
And then you can explicitly
just do the different spaces

1052
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,040
and see that you get a scaling.

1053
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,210
It seems to be a
surprisingly emergent feature

1054
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,190
of many of these models.

1055
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:32,740
And once again, it
may be something

1056
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,492
that tells us less
about biology than it

1057
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,700
does about math or something.

1058
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:44,940

1059
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,890
Any other questions about
this, the base notion

1060
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,390
of this niche
hierarchy type models?

1061
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:54,510

1062
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,060
So I want to spend
some time talking

1063
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,830
about this neutral
theory in ecology.

1064
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,550
The math, in particular
the derivation

1065
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,216
of this particular
closed form solution,

1066
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:04,775
is not really so
interesting or relevant.

1067
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:06,650
But I think it's very
important to understand

1068
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,635
what the assumptions are in the
model and maybe also something

1069
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:12,260
about the circumstances in which
we think that it should apply.

1070
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:25,530

1071
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,370
So the basic idea is that
we have, what we hope,

1072
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:36,140
is some metacommunity
that is large.

1073
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,530

1074
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,900
And then we have an island.

1075
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,670
So this has to do with this
theory of island biogeography.

1076
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,185
We have an island over here.

1077
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:51,540
And in the context of the
nomenclature of this paper,

1078
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,249
they are some community
size, size j here.

1079
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:56,165
This tells us about the
number of individuals.

1080
00:52:56,165 --> 00:53:01,360

1081
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,830
And they're distributed
across some number of species.

1082
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,710
Now, the neutral
theory, the key thing

1083
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,260
is that we assume that all
individuals are identical.

1084
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:22,780

1085
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,490
And once again, it's not
that the neutral theorists

1086
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,310
believe that this is true.

1087
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:31,314
It's that they think that it
may be sufficient to explain

1088
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:32,605
the patterns that are observed.

1089
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:40,755

1090
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:42,880
And when we say that all
individuals are identical,

1091
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,470
what we mean is that the
demographic parameters are

1092
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,586
the same, birth, death rates.

1093
00:53:49,586 --> 00:53:53,990

1094
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,460
And it's even a stronger
assumption, in some ways,

1095
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,010
than that.

1096
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,010
It's assuming that the
individuals are the same,

1097
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,360
the species are the same, and
that there are no interactions

1098
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,560
within the species as well.

1099
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,880
So there's no Alley effect,
or no specific competition.

1100
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,480
So the birth, death
rates are going

1101
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:16,120
to be independent of everything,
which is an amazingly

1102
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,917
parsimonious model.

1103
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:19,250
And it's kind of amazing you
can get anything out of it.

1104
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:24,040

1105
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,150
And then we have a
migration rate m.

1106
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,740
It's either a rate
or a probability,

1107
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,230
depending on how
you think about it.

1108
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,490
Rate or probability m.

1109
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:42,330
And can somebody remind
us how we handle that?

1110
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:48,713

1111
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:51,168
AUDIENCE: Both just
in a community?

1112
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:52,150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1113
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,114
AUDIENCE: At some
probability that

1114
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:57,167
is proportional to the
distribution of the species

1115
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:58,042
in the metacommunity?

1116
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,790

1117
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

1118
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,531
AUDIENCE: --transfer
an individual

1119
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:05,919
from the metacommunity
to the island.

1120
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:06,710
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

1121
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,264
AUDIENCE: We do
stick to the island

1122
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:09,820
to make sure that
number of individuals.

1123
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,528
PROFESSOR: Right.

1124
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:15,150
So what we're going to
do is we're basically

1125
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,570
going to pick a random
individual, here, each cycle.

1126
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,440
This is kind of like
a Moran process.

1127
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,320
We're going to pick
an individual here.

1128
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,950
And we're going to kill him.

1129
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,740
And then what we're going to
do is, with probability m,

1130
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,830
replace that individual
with one member

1131
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,030
of the metacommunity at random.

1132
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,930
So the rate coming
from here will

1133
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,380
be proportional to the species
abundance in the metacommunity.

1134
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,430
And with a probability of 1
minus m, what we're going to do

1135
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,400
is we're going to
replace that individual

1136
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,960
with another individual
in the island.

1137
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,510
Now, the math kind of gets
hairy and complicated.

1138
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:01,547
But the basic notion
is really quite simple.

1139
00:56:01,547 --> 00:56:03,130
You have a metacommunity
distribution,

1140
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,980
which is going to end up
being the so-called Fisher log

1141
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,030
series in this model.

1142
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:13,780

1143
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,004
This describes the species
abundance on the metacommunity.

1144
00:56:17,004 --> 00:56:18,420
But then on the
island, we're just

1145
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,100
going to assume that there's
birth, death that occurs over

1146
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,210
here at some rate.

1147
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,205
But we don't even have to
hardly think about that.

1148
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:27,330
From the standpoint of,
say, a simulation or model,

1149
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,070
we just run multiple
cycles of this,

1150
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,260
where we have j individuals.

1151
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
And we always have
j individuals,

1152
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,830
because it's like
the Moran process.

1153
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,066
At every time point,
we kill one individual,

1154
00:56:35,066 --> 00:56:37,690
and we replace it, with somebody
either from the same community

1155
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,840
or from the island.

1156
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:47,539
And you can imagine that in
the limit of m going to zero,

1157
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:49,080
what's going to
happen on the island?

1158
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,240

1159
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,120
Yeah, so you'll end up
just one species, just

1160
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,980
because this is just
random, like genetic drift.

1161
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,410
It's ecological drift where
one species will take over.

1162
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,320
Whereas if m is large,
then somehow it's

1163
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,405
more of a reflection
of the metacommunity.

1164
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:13,680

1165
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,830
Are there any questions
about what this model

1166
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,098
is looking like for now?

1167
00:57:18,098 --> 00:57:20,264
AUDIENCE: Could we talk
about the Fisher log series?

1168
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:20,732
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1169
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,606
AUDIENCE: So we would
put it on the same axis

1170
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,540
as the [INAUDIBLE]?

1171
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,770
PROFESSOR: Yes, this is a
very, very good question.

1172
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,319
So we'll do this
in just a moment.

1173
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,610
Because this is very important.

1174
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,210

1175
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,950
I want to say just a couple
things about this model.

1176
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,750
So when I read this
paper, what I imagined

1177
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,208
is that it really
looked like this.

1178
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:44,890
This was Panama, and that,
30 kilometers off the coast,

1179
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:48,610
there was this island,
BCI, Barro Colorado Island.

1180
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,560
But that's not maybe
an accurate description

1181
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,660
of what the real
system looks like.

1182
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,340
Does anybody know where BCI is?

1183
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,907
AUDIENCE: It's in Panama.

1184
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:58,490
PROFESSOR: Hm?

1185
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,350
AUDIENCE: Panama.

1186
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,600
PROFESSOR: So it is in Panama.

1187
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,430
But it's not off
the coast of Panama.

1188
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,820
I guess that was my original.

1189
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,450
AUDIENCE: It's in the canal.

1190
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,050
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's in the canal.

1191
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,400
So it's an island
that was created when

1192
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,540
they made the Panama Canal.

1193
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,520
So this thing was
not always an island.

1194
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,240
It's been an island
for 100 years.

1195
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,959
And it's in the
middle of a canal.

1196
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:20,250
And they actually have cougars
that swim back and forth

1197
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,980
from the mainland.

1198
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,952
But it does make you
wonder whether this

1199
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:32,390
is-- it's much more strongly
coupled to the mainland

1200
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:36,670
then I imagined when I
read this paper at first.

1201
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,390
I don't know what that
means for all this.

1202
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,680
But certainly, you
expect this to be

1203
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,880
a more or less appropriate
model depending on this.

1204
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,810
Because, of course,
if you went and you

1205
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,990
sampled 50 hectares
here, you wouldn't

1206
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,440
believe that it should
have the same distribution.

1207
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,706
You'd believe it should be more
like the Fisher log series.

1208
00:58:54,706 --> 00:58:57,080
And there's some evidence that
things are tilted in a way

1209
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,920
that you would expect.

1210
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,003
And we'll talk about that.

1211
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:01,890

1212
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:02,470
It's tricky.

1213
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,990
And of course, you have to
decide in all this stuff, oh,

1214
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,480
what do you mean
by free parameters?

1215
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,750
And actually, it seems
like people can't count.

1216
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,541
And we'll talk about
this in a moment, too.

1217
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,680

1218
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,830
Because, of course,
constructing the model,

1219
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,450
there's some sense of free
parameters that you have there.

1220
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,360
Because we could
have said, oh, it's

1221
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,140
just going to be the Fisher log
series, or we could have said,

1222
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,880
oh, it's going to be island.

1223
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,296
Or we could have
said, oh, there's

1224
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:26,660
another island out here.

1225
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,760
And then that would be
another distribution.

1226
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,480
And not all of these things
introduce more free parameters,

1227
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,550
necessarily, because
you could say,

1228
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,049
oh, this is the
same migration rate,

1229
00:59:34,049 --> 00:59:35,240
or you could do something.

1230
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,770
But they are going to lead
to different distributions,

1231
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:38,680
and you have that
freedom when you're

1232
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,804
trying to explain the data.

1233
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:42,180

1234
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,156
There are a lot of judgment
calls in this business.

1235
00:59:46,156 --> 00:59:47,780
But let's talk about
Fisher log series,

1236
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,995
because this is relevant.

1237
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:54,550

1238
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,680
So the model is very similar
to what we did for the master

1239
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,290
equation in the context
of gene expression

1240
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,930
and the number of mRNA.

1241
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:06,610
So was the equilibrium
or steady state

1242
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,540
distribution of mRNA in a cell,
was that a Fisher log series?

1243
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,420
Yes or no, five seconds?

1244
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,060

1245
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,970
Was the mRNA steady state
probability distribution

1246
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:21,990
a Fisher log series?

1247
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:24,550
Ready, three, two, one.

1248
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,450

1249
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,030
No.

1250
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:28,529
No.

1251
01:00:28,529 --> 01:00:29,415
What was it?

1252
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:30,870
It was a Poisson.

1253
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,420
And you guys should review what
all these distributions are,

1254
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,790
when you get them, and so forth.

1255
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,300
So what was the
Difference why is it

1256
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:48,770
that we have some
probability, P0, P1, P2?

1257
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,490
This could be mRNA
or it could be

1258
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,590
number of individuals in
some species with some birth

1259
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,440
and death rates.

1260
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,070
What was the key difference
between the mRNA model, which

1261
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,670
led to this distribution
becoming Poisson,

1262
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,790
and the model that we
just studied here, where

1263
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,080
it became a Fisher log series?

1264
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,200

1265
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,020
And I should maybe write down
what the Fisher log series is.

1266
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:17,740
So this is the expected number
of species with n individuals

1267
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,069
on the metacommunity.

1268
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:20,360
Here is the Fisher log species.

1269
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,970
There was some theta X
to the n divided by n.

1270
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:28,782

1271
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:29,990
So what's the key difference?

1272
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,244
Yeah.

1273
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:36,711
AUDIENCE: I think that the
birth and death rates are

1274
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,202
both proportional [INAUDIBLE].

1275
01:01:38,202 --> 01:01:41,989

1276
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,780
PROFESSOR: Right, the
birth and death rates

1277
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,855
are both proportional.

1278
01:01:44,855 --> 01:01:46,330
AUDIENCE: In the
Fisher log series.

1279
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,829
PROFESSOR: In the
Fisher log series.

1280
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:51,630
So what we have is that
b0-- and what should we

1281
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,544
call b0 in this model?

1282
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1283
01:01:56,055 --> 01:01:57,430
PROFESSOR: Well,
right now, we're

1284
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:59,026
thinking about
the metacommunity.

1285
01:01:59,026 --> 01:01:59,900
AUDIENCE: Speciation.

1286
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,816
PROFESSOR: Speciation.

1287
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:03,870
b0 is speciation, which
we're going to assume

1288
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,670
is going to be constant.

1289
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:11,070
In this model, do we have
speciation on the island?

1290
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,046
No.

1291
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:13,420
The assumption is
that the island

1292
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,280
is small enough that the rate of
speciation is just negligible.

1293
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,164
So speciation plays
a role in forming

1294
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:22,080
the metacommunity
distribution, but it doesn't

1295
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,210
play a role in the model.

1296
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,280
So this is speciation.

1297
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,610
But then what we assume
is that b1, here,

1298
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:35,180
is equal to some
fundamental rate b times n,

1299
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,870
but it's b times,
in this case, 1.

1300
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:43,840
So more broadly, bn is equal
to some birth rate times n.

1301
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,290
This is saying that the
individuals can give birth

1302
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,260
to other individuals.

1303
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,919
Now, we're not assuming anything
about sexual reproduction

1304
01:02:51,919 --> 01:02:52,710
necessarily or not.

1305
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,320
We're just saying
that the kind of rates

1306
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,800
are proportional to the numbers.

1307
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,520
So if you have twice
as many individuals,

1308
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,209
the birth rate will
be twice as large.

1309
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,000
This is reasonable.

1310
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,980

1311
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,250
This is Pn and
this is Pn plus 1.

1312
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:17,200
So this is d of n plus
1 is equal to some death

1313
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,330
rate times n plus 1.

1314
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,800
So each individual just
has some rate of dying.

1315
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,152
It's exponentially distributed.

1316
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:24,110
This again makes sense.

1317
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,750

1318
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,990
What was the key difference
between our mRNA model,

1319
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,406
from before that
gave the Poisson,

1320
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,670
and this model that gives
the Fisher log series?

1321
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,992
AUDIENCE: So with the mRNA, it's
with a standard like a chemical

1322
01:03:36,992 --> 01:03:41,952
equation where there's
some fixed external input.

1323
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:44,680
But then the
degradation is according

1324
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,920
to the amount that you have.

1325
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,420
So death is proportionate
[INAUDIBLE].

1326
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,790
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

1327
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,400
In both cases, the death rate
is proportional to the number

1328
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,140
of either mRNA or individuals.

1329
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,140
However, in the mRNA
model, what we assume

1330
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,840
is there some just constant
rate of transcription,

1331
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,466
so a constant rate, per unit
time, of making more mRNA.

1332
01:04:02,466 --> 01:04:03,840
So just because
there's more mRNA

1333
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,950
doesn't mean that you're
going to get more mRNA.

1334
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,080
But here, we assume
that the birth rate

1335
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,100
is proportional to the number.

1336
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,982
So that's what leads
to the difference.

1337
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:15,690
And so this is one of
the few other cases

1338
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,060
that you can simply
solve the master equation

1339
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,692
and get an equilibrium
distribution.

1340
01:04:19,692 --> 01:04:21,650
And it's the same thing
we do from just always,

1341
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:26,840
where we say, at steady
state, the probability fluxes

1342
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,800
or whatever are equal.

1343
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,510
So you get that P1
should be equal to P0.

1344
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,316
and then we have a
b0 divided by d1.

1345
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:39,130
And more broadly, we
just cycle through.

1346
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,400
The probability of
being in the nth state,

1347
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,060
it's going to be some P0.

1348
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:48,380
And then basically, it's
going to b0 divided by d1,

1349
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:58,470
b1 divided by d2, b2, d3, dot,
dot, dot, up to bn minus 1 dn.

1350
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,780
And indeed, if we just plug in
what these things are equal to,

1351
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:06,650
we end up getting-- there's
P0, the fundamental birth

1352
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,191
over death to the nth power.

1353
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:09,940
And then we just are
left with a 1 over n.

1354
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,170
Because we're going to have a
2 here and a 2 here, and those

1355
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:13,670
cancel.

1356
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,370
A 2 here and 3 here,
and those cancel.

1357
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:20,130
And we're just left with
the n at the end, finally.

1358
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:24,470
So this x, over there,
is then, in this model,

1359
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,920
the ratio of the
birth and death rates.

1360
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,890
So which one is larger?

1361
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,330
Is it A slash 1?

1362
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,270
Is it b is greater than d?

1363
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:39,844
Or is it b slash 2,
that b is less than d?

1364
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:41,260
Think about this
for five seconds.

1365
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,770

1366
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:47,002
Do you think that
birth rates should

1367
01:05:47,002 --> 01:05:48,710
be larger than death
rates or death rates

1368
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,168
should be larger than birth
rates or do they have to equal?

1369
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:54,990

1370
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,940
Ready, three, two, one.

1371
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,460

1372
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:07,780
So we got a number of-- it's
kind of distributed, 1 and 2's.

1373
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,322
Well, it's maybe not that
deep, not deep enough.

1374
01:06:10,322 --> 01:06:11,780
Can somebody say
why their neighbor

1375
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,988
thinks it's one or the other?

1376
01:06:12,988 --> 01:06:15,374

1377
01:06:15,374 --> 01:06:17,290
People are actually
turning to their neighbor.

1378
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,720

1379
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,336
A justification for
one or the other.

1380
01:06:22,336 --> 01:06:26,144
AUDIENCE: So if this
problem where b over d

1381
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:30,242
is greater than 1, then this
distribution is not normalized.

1382
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:30,950
PROFESSOR: Right.

1383
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:35,380
So if b over d is greater than
1, so if x is greater than 1,

1384
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,480
then this distribution blows up.

1385
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,230
Then it gets more and
more likely to have

1386
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,240
all these larger numbers.

1387
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,510
But then if b is less than d,
shouldn't everybody be extinct?

1388
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,000
No.

1389
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,640
Can somebody else say
why it is that it's OK

1390
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,640
for b to be less than d?

1391
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,348
If birth rates are
less than death rates,

1392
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:56,681
shouldn't everyone be extinct?

1393
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:59,140
AUDIENCE: Because
there's a rate b0.

1394
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,350
PROFESSOR: Because there's
a rate b0, exactly.

1395
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,250
So there's a finite
rate of speciation.

1396
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,505
So it's true that every
species will go extinct.

1397
01:07:05,505 --> 01:07:08,070

1398
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:12,050
But because we have a constant
influx of new species,

1399
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:16,170
we end up with this distribution
that's this Fisher log series.

1400
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:21,230
Now, if you plot the
Fisher log series,

1401
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:23,690
it looks a bit like this.

1402
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,990
But let's think about
it a little bit.

1403
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,540
Does the Fisher log
series, does it fall off,

1404
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,200
A, faster or slower than this?

1405
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:41,580
Fisher falls, A, faster-- this
is in this direction-- or, B,

1406
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,080
slower?

1407
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:48,519

1408
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:50,060
AUDIENCE: Faster or
slower than what?

1409
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,300
PROFESSOR: Than the
island distribution.

1410
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,640
Because you can see that this
falls off pretty rapidly.

1411
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,180

1412
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,250
Ready, maybe?

1413
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,575
Three, two, one.

1414
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:14,850

1415
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:18,452
I saw a fair number
of people that

1416
01:08:18,452 --> 01:08:20,380
don't want to make a guess.

1417
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,810
Indeed, it's going to be faster.

1418
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:22,765
Can somebody say why?

1419
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:26,639

1420
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:27,139
Yeah.

1421
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:28,055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1422
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:30,361

1423
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:32,569
PROFESSOR: Is it going to
be because of the 1 over n?

1424
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:34,460
I mean the 1 over n
is certainly relevant.

1425
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,399

1426
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,899
Without the one
over n, then we just

1427
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:40,930
have sort of a geometric series.

1428
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,550
And the log normal is not just
a geometric series either.

1429
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:47,382

1430
01:08:47,382 --> 01:08:53,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Whereas
this has a very long tail.

1431
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,590
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1432
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,649
So this falls off.

1433
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:58,189

1434
01:08:58,189 --> 01:08:59,689
This would be kind
of exponentially,

1435
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,272
and this is faster
than exponentially.

1436
01:09:01,272 --> 01:09:03,420

1437
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,600
And indeed, this make
sense based on the model.

1438
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,840
Because this
community, the reason

1439
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,920
that it has some very,
very abundant species

1440
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,090
is partly because
it gets migration

1441
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,479
from the abundant species here.

1442
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,680

1443
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,200
This falls off pretty quickly.

1444
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,450
But those frequent species still
can play a pretty important

1445
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:33,859
role in the island community,
because the migration rate

1446
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:38,924
is influenced by large numbers.

1447
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,340
And the other thing
is, of course,

1448
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,890
that the rare species are
going to often go extinct.

1449
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,880
I mean the distribution
on the island

1450
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,330
is some complicated process
of the dynamics going here,

1451
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,800
plus sampling from here.

1452
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,480
But there's a sense that it's
biased towards-- it's not just

1453
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,690
a reflection of
the metacommunity,

1454
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,430
because the migration
rate is sampled

1455
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,830
towards the abundant species.

1456
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:02,620
So the migration
of these species

1457
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,980
ends up playing a major role
in pushing the distribution

1458
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,390
to the right.

1459
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:14,500
So you have much more frequent,
abundant species on the island

1460
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,205
as compared to the mainland.

1461
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:19,167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1462
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:19,833
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1463
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:23,015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
measurement of the distribution

1464
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:24,940
on the--

1465
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,500
PROFESSOR: Well,
I'm sure they have.

1466
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,810

1467
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,450
I think the statement
that there's a faster fall

1468
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,120
off on mainlands
than on the islands

1469
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,580
I think is borne
out by the data.

1470
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:42,730
But I don't know if trees on
the Panama side of the canal

1471
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:45,050
are actually better described
by a Fisher log series

1472
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:47,215
as compared to this, though.

1473
01:10:47,215 --> 01:10:50,185
AUDIENCE: I guess my question
was the abundant species

1474
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:52,907
that we see on the
island, is it just

1475
01:10:52,907 --> 01:10:57,120
the result of diffusive drift?

1476
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,630
PROFESSOR: Well, this also
has the diffusive drift.

1477
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:08,398

1478
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:12,462
AUDIENCE: But in the sense
that what really pushes.

1479
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:13,920
PROFESSOR: Well,
I mean I think you

1480
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,705
need both, the diffusive
drift and the migration.

1481
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,010
But I think that the fact
that the migration is

1482
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,720
from the mainland,
and it's biased

1483
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,190
towards those abundant
things, I think

1484
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,849
is necessary or important.

1485
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,890
AUDIENCE: I guess just in
terms of distinguishing

1486
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:33,133
between the niche and
the neutral models,

1487
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:39,733
as applied to the mainland, does
the niche model predict also

1488
01:11:39,733 --> 01:11:40,274
a log normal?

1489
01:11:40,274 --> 01:11:42,644
Because it seemed like,
in the discussion earlier,

1490
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:47,584
the neutral also predicted
log normal [INAUDIBLE].

1491
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:49,000
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

1492
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,200

1493
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,560
In this whole area, I mean
it's a little bit empirical.

1494
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,490
The fact that the niche
model kind of predicts

1495
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:05,790
this, or this broken stick
thing predicts a log normal,

1496
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:08,540
they didn't say anything
about islands there, right?

1497
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:11,630
I guess even Fisher's
original log series,

1498
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:14,752
he used it to
describe-- I think maybe

1499
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:16,210
that was the beetles
on the Thames.

1500
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:19,790
But his original data set,
where the Fisher log series

1501
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,970
was supposed to
described it, as it

1502
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,060
was sampled better and
better, it eventually

1503
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,393
started looking more and more
like a log normal anyways.

1504
01:12:26,393 --> 01:12:29,316

1505
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:31,190
I mean it's easy to see
the frequent species,

1506
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:34,560
because you see them.

1507
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,930
This tail can actually
be very hard to see,

1508
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,145
because you have to
find the individuals.

1509
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:43,770

1510
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,550
It's a good question of to
what degree each of the models

1511
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:49,580
really predicts one thing
on one place and another.

1512
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:53,450
There's always tweaks of each
model that adjust things.

1513
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,010
So I think it's a bit muddy.

1514
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:01,070

1515
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:03,240
But the one thing that
I want to highlight.

1516
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,420
So there's a lot
of debates, then,

1517
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,150
between these different models.

1518
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,260
And each of the
models have some fit.

1519
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,180
They have red and black.

1520
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,860
There's one that kind
of goes like this.

1521
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,820
And another one that
kind of goes like that.

1522
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:20,410
And they're not labeled,
because they look the same.

1523
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:23,990
And you can argue about chi
squareds and everything,

1524
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,290
but I think it's irrelevant.

1525
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,490
They both fit the data fine.

1526
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:31,670
And the other thing,
just the sampling of kind

1527
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:35,710
root n sampling, if you
expect to see 10 species,

1528
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:38,355
then if you go and you
actually do sampling,

1529
01:13:38,355 --> 01:13:41,330
you expect to have kind
of a root n on each one.

1530
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:44,110
I mean the error bars,
I think, around this

1531
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:46,540
are consistent with both models.

1532
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,259
So I'd say that the
exercise of trying

1533
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:51,550
to distinguish those models
based on fit to such a data

1534
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:55,760
set I think is hopeless
from the beginning.

1535
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,640
And then you can talk about
the number of parameters.

1536
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,350
And if you read
these two papers,

1537
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,124
they both say that
they have fewer number

1538
01:14:02,124 --> 01:14:02,915
of free parameters.

1539
01:14:02,915 --> 01:14:05,610

1540
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,862
And it is hard to
believe that there could

1541
01:14:07,862 --> 01:14:09,070
be a disagreement about this.

1542
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,534

1543
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:14,200
But then, you know,
it's like, oh, well,

1544
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,080
what do you call
a free parameter?

1545
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,950
And then what they say, any
given RSA data set contains

1546
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:22,110
information about the
local community size j.

1547
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,790

1548
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:27,155
So they say, given that,
it's not a free parameter,

1549
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:28,705
because you put that in.

1550
01:14:28,705 --> 01:14:30,080
That's the number
of individuals.

1551
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,093
And then outcome is your
distribution, right?

1552
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,800
And you say, OK, well,
all right, that's

1553
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,008
fine if you don't want to
call that a free parameter.

1554
01:14:36,008 --> 01:14:39,510
But then when you fit the log
normal to this distribution,

1555
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,720
the overall amplitude
is also to give you

1556
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,280
the number of individuals
in the metacommunity.

1557
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,880
So if you don't call j a
free parameter in this model,

1558
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,840
then you can't call the
amplitude a free parameter when

1559
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,970
you fit the log normal,
at least in my opinion.

1560
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,540
I think that they
both have three.

1561
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,570
Because if you fit a
log normal to this,

1562
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:05,890
you have the overall amplitude.

1563
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,300
That's the number
of individuals.

1564
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:11,350
And then you have the mean
and the standard deviation

1565
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:14,089
or whatever.

1566
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,047
From that standpoint, I
think they're the same.

1567
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:16,547
Yeah.

1568
01:15:16,547 --> 01:15:18,909
AUDIENCE: But I mean how
do you fit the log normal

1569
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:19,863
when you don't impose?

1570
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,294
Do they impose the amplitude?

1571
01:15:21,294 --> 01:15:24,530

1572
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,400
I mean it's still a parameter.

1573
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:26,890
PROFESSOR: No, that's
what I was saying.

1574
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:27,650
It's a parameter.

1575
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:30,302
I mean the normalized log
normal, you integrate,

1576
01:15:30,302 --> 01:15:31,010
and it goes to 1.

1577
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:32,600
But then you have
some measured number

1578
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,020
of individuals in your
sample, and then you

1579
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:37,650
have to multiply by
that to give you.

1580
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,337
AUDIENCE: But is that what
they do when they do their fit?

1581
01:15:40,337 --> 01:15:41,003
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1582
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,544
AUDIENCE: Or do they keep that
amplitude as also a parameter?

1583
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:46,040

1584
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,320
PROFESSOR: I think that
you can argue whether this

1585
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,540
is a free parameter or not.

1586
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,440
But I think that
you can just put it

1587
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,149
as the number of
individuals, and it's not

1588
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,190
going to affect anything.

1589
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,330
You could actually
have it be a free.

1590
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,790
But this gets into this
question about what constitutes

1591
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,230
a free parameter or not.

1592
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,740
And actually, there is
some subtlety to this.

1593
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:09,664
But I think, at
the end of the day,

1594
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:11,580
the log normal is not
going to look like this.

1595
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,840
You have to.

1596
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
You basically put in the
number of individuals

1597
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,880
that you measured.

1598
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,840
AUDIENCE: So when you
calculate [INAUDIBLE]?

1599
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,750

1600
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,380
PROFESSOR: Huge
numbers of pages of

1601
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,602
has been written about
comparing these things.

1602
01:16:27,602 --> 01:16:30,060
At some point, it comes down
to this philosophical question

1603
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,300
about what you think
constitutes a null model.

1604
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,990
And this gets to be
much more subtle.

1605
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,200
And I think reasonable
people can disagree

1606
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,990
about whether the null model
that you need to reject

1607
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,800
should be this
neutral model or if it

1608
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,160
should be a niche-based model.

1609
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,997
Or maybe it's just that there's
some multiplicative type

1610
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:48,330
process that's going on and
gives you distributions that

1611
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:50,790
look like this, and you need
other kinds of information

1612
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,260
to try to distinguish
those things.

1613
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,051
And in particular, I'd
say that it's really

1614
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:56,940
the dynamic information in which
these models have strikingly

1615
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,398
different predictions,
and then you

1616
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:00,820
can reject neutral-type models.

1617
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,160
Because that neutral
models predict

1618
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,820
that these species
that are abundant

1619
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,380
are just transiently abundant,
and they should go way.

1620
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,630
Whereas the niche-based
models would say,

1621
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:09,760
oh, they're really fixed.

1622
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,324
And indeed, in many cases,
the abundant species kind of

1623
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:14,740
stick around longer
than you would

1624
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,320
expect from a neutral model.

1625
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,692
Of course, the neutral model
is not true in the sense

1626
01:17:19,692 --> 01:17:21,400
that different
individuals are different.

1627
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,500
But it's important to
highlight that even

1628
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,210
such a minimal
model can give you

1629
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,220
striking patterns that
are similar to what

1630
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,756
you observe in nature.

1631
01:17:30,756 --> 01:17:32,130
And so I think
we're out of time.

1632
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:33,560
So with that, I
think we'll quit.

1633
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,250
But it's been a pleasure having
you guys for this semester.

1634
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,870
And if you have any
questions about any systems

1635
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:41,460
biology things in the
future, please, email me.

1636
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,460
I'm happy to meet up.

1637
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,203
Good luck on the final.

1638
01:17:44,203 --> 01:17:44,703
