10
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,250
PROFESSOR: So today,
what we're going

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,160
to do is we want to talk about
this idea of autoregulation,

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,930
so what happens when a gene
regulates its own expression.

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,910
And I think that this
is a really nice topic

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,960
because it really encapsulates
several of the big themes

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,350
that we're going to be seeing
throughout the semester.

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,710
So first there's this
idea of a network motif.

17
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,980
So this motif, it's the
simplest possible motif

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,344
where a gene regulates itself.

19
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,760
It occurs more frequently than
you would expect by chance.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,550
We'll explain what
we mean by that.

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,460
And then possibly an
evolutionary explanation

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,730
is that this thing may
be advantageous in one

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,660
way or another.

24
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,800
Now, there are two basic kinds
of negative autoregulation,

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,820
or sorry, two basic
kinds of autoregulation.

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,150
There's negative and positive.

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,640
So negative means
that that protein

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,890
represses its own expression.

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,570
Positive autoregulation
would mean

30
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,420
that it is activating
or upregulating

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,814
its own expression.

32
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:12,480
So down here is
positive autoregulation.

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,480

34
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,865
And these things have very
different possible purposes.

35
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,740
All right, we'll see
that there are basically

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,300
two things that negative
autoregulation may do for us.

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,480
First is that it
speeds the on time

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,494
relative to simple
no regulation.

39
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,660
But the other thing is kind
of an interesting thing,

40
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,046
which is that the protein
concentration is somehow

41
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:40,545
robust.

42
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,300

43
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,250
And robust means that
it's comparatively

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,640
non-sensitive or
insensitive to something.

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,723
And particularly, this
means protein concentration

46
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:55,930
is robust to say fluctuations
in the production rate.

47
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,640

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,620
In various contexts, we're
going to see how robustness

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,246
is an important goal,
that biology might have,

50
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,700
a particular cell might have.

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,169
And that you would like
this protein concentration

52
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,030
to be robust to a
wide range of things.

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,145
But in this case, anytime
you talk about robust,

54
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,770
you have to say all
right, it's robust.

55
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,020
What is it that's
robust against what?

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,810
In this case, its
protein concentration

57
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,935
is robust, the fluctuations
in the production rate.

58
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:25,290

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,610
Now, positive autoregulation,
on the other hand, in some ways

60
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,610
makes these two things worse.

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,540
We'll discuss what
we mean by that.

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,210
But it perhaps performs
some other functions.

63
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,050
In particular, it allows for
the possibility of bistability,

64
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,240
and hence memory.

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,570
And we'll explain how memory
appears in this process.

66
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,977

67
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:52,560
But before we get
into autoregulation,

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,930
I just want to do a quick
review of this thing

69
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,460
about getting intuition
or binding of activators,

70
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,430
for example, to the promoter.

71
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,345
But also how we can use this
thing about sequestration

72
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:06,720
in order to generate
what we call

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,969
this ultra-sensitive response.

74
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,710

75
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,220
Now, when we talk
about this, we're

76
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,250
often thinking about
a question that we'd

77
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,970
like the rate of
expression of some gene

78
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,460
to be sensitive or
be ultra-sensitive to

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,100
the concentration of something.

80
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:31,290
So if you have x activating
y, then what you might like,

81
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,290
in many cases, is for
there to be an essentially

82
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,320
digital response, where if
you think about the production

83
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,060
rate of y as a function
of this input x,

84
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,300
you might like it to just be
very sharp, to be essentially

85
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,190
0.

86
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,590
Quickly to come up, and
then saturate at some level,

87
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,030
beta maybe.

88
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,390
Now, the question is how
is it that you can do that?

89
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,070
One thing that we discussed
that could get you

90
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,910
something kind of like this.

91
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,816
Does anybody remember what
the base solution might be?

92
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,190
AUDIENCE: Cooperative
regulation.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,898
PROFESSOR: Right,
cooperative regulation.

94
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:10,500
So if it's the case that
you have, for example,

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,760
a tetramer of x that is
somehow activating y,

96
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,980
then you can get
something that looks,

97
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,600
maybe not this sharp, but much
sharper than what you get,

98
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,900
which is the simple
Michaelis-Menten-type

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,600
looking curve if you just had a
single monomer of x activating

100
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,790
y.

101
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,460
So one solution is
indeed cooperativity.

102
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,610

103
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,950
But I think that there's
another interesting one that

104
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:45,180
is this-- second
solution is this idea

105
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,865
of molecular titration.

106
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:52,520

107
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,880
I kind of explained the basic
idea at the end of the lecture

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,364
on Tuesday.

109
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,780
But then what we
want to do is try

110
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,680
to get a sense of what
the requirements might

111
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,016
be for the bindings in order
to generate this effect.

112
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,890
So what we have is a
situation where we have,

113
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,580
again, just x is regulating y.

114
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,720
But it's a little
bit more complicated,

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,110
because this protein
x, in addition

116
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,900
to binding the promoter and
activating expression of y,

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,730
we also have the
possibility that x

118
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,340
can bind to something else.

119
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,980
In particular, there might be
some other protein, maybe w,

120
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,125
which combined reversibly
into some complex wx.

121
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,900

122
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,210
Now, for some situations--
in particular,

123
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:47,310
if we describe this by
some Kw and this by some Kd

124
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,990
we can ask in what
regime will this

125
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,460
generate an ultra-sensitive
response, where

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,750
as a function of the total
concentration of x-- So

127
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,040
we might want to call that
x total, just be clear.

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,750
We'd like it that there's
very little expression of y,

129
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,830
and that all of a sudden to
get maximal, if you like,

130
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,004
expression of y.

131
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:11,420
And the question
is, well, what do

132
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,375
we need in terms of these
KwKd's, and so forth.

133
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,500
So there are going to be
three different conditions

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,910
that we're going to play with.

135
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:27,680

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,340
First might be the relationship
between this Kd, the affinity

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,810
of binding of that transcription
factor to the promoter,

138
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,165
as compared to this Kw.

139
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,670

140
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,430
I will write some options,
but as always, you

141
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,465
should start thinking.

142
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:44,840
You don't need to
watch me write.

143
00:06:44,840 --> 00:07:13,570

144
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,724
Don't know again.

145
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:15,640
So I'll give you that.

146
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,960
Just 30 seconds
to think about it.

147
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,460
Yes.

148
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,255
AUDIENCE: Is Kw the
dissociation constant?

149
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,630
Like if the
concentration w times

150
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,560
concentration x over the--

151
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,370
PROFESSOR: Right,
so it's the guy that

152
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,450
has units of concentration.

153
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,420
So lower in both these cases
corresponds to tighter binding.

154
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:42,570

155
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,599
I'll let you think
for 20 seconds maybe.

156
00:07:44,599 --> 00:08:01,984

157
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:02,900
Do you need more time?

158
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,200

159
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,350
And it's OK if you are not
100% convinced of something.

160
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,200
It's useful to just make a
guess and then we can discuss.

161
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Shall we go for it?

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,660
Everybody have your
tools in front of you?

163
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,870
All right, ready.

164
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,150
Three, two, one.

165
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,900

166
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,990
So we have, I'd say, a fair
amount of disagreement,

167
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,550
actually.

168
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,010
I'd say we got
some A's, B's, C's.

169
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,569

170
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,110
I don't know.

171
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,476
There might be a one or two D's.

172
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,600
Why don't we go ahead and
turn to a neighbor there.

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,808
You should definitely be
able to find a neighbor that

174
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,220
disagrees with you.

175
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,280
And try to convince
them that you--

176
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,530
AUDIENCE: What's the question?

177
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,430
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

178
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,900
No, no, all right,
so the question

179
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,820
is, what conditions do
these things need in order

180
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,750
to have an
ultra-sensitive response,

181
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,710
where the rate of
production is what?

182
00:08:58,710 --> 00:10:04,484
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

183
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,900
PROFESSOR: All right, why don't
we go ahead and reconvene.

184
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,714
And maybe I'll just
get a sense of what

185
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,380
the state of your
thinking is right now.

186
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,963
All right, so once
again, the question

187
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:16,280
is, we want to know what
the relationship between all

188
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,530
these binding affinities
concentrations

189
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,090
has to be in order to get
an ultra-sensitive response,

190
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,802
where the function of the
total amount of x-- you add x.

191
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,260
At first, you don't get really
much of any expression of y,

192
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,070
but all of a sudden,
you get a lot.

193
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,140
And first, we want to know the
relationship between Kd and Kw.

194
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
Let's go ahead and vote.

195
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,820
Ready?

196
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,150
Three, two, one.

197
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,710
We're still on this one.

199
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,980
So yeah, you could ignore these.

200
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,688
It's just that it
takes me time to write.

201
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:53,050
So I wanted to take
advantage of your discussion.

202
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,320
We're still on this one.

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,390
Do you guys understand
what I'm trying to ask?

204
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,070
Okay, all right, ready.

205
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,480
Three, two, one.

206
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,130
All right, I'm going to cover
this so nobody gets confused.

207
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,980
All right, so we have
a fair pocket of C's

208
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,850
back there, but then
some other distributions.

209
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,470
So we've got some
discussion over here.

210
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,240
So maybe somebody can
offer their insight?

211
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,550

212
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,885
What did your neighbor think?

213
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:33,466
AUDIENCE: My neighbor
thought that at first, there

214
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:38,784
should be the binding
between x and to the gene.

215
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:44,700
So x should bind much
more equally with w.

216
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,435
That's why Kw should be--

217
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,060
PROFESSOR: All right,
so you're arguing

218
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,610
that you want Kw to be
much smaller than Kd here.

219
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,910
Because as you add x, you
want initially for them

220
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,691
all to be sequestered
by molecule w.

221
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that OK?

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,260
So if somebody's neighbor
thought it should instead be B,

223
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,920
do you want to offer
their argument?

224
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,260

225
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,630
Everybody's neighbors
now convinced that C is--

226
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,320

227
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,330
So I'm going to side with that.

228
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,280
So the idea here is that
what you'd really like

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,780
is-- The principle of this
is that Kw is perfect,

230
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,220
and then that corresponds
to going to 0.

231
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,930
Then that means that
if you plot the free x

232
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,170
as a function of
x total, then what

233
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,630
does it start out
being if Kw is 0?

234
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,724
0, right?

235
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,890
And when thinking about the
concentration of free x,

236
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,380
do we have to think about or
worry about how much x is down

237
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,170
to the promoter?

238
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,432
No, we'll say that
so long as you

239
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,720
have any reasonable
concentration of x, then

240
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,690
the one x that binds to that
promoter, binds that DNA,

241
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,440
is not going to affect the
concentration of free x.

242
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,890
So we really just have to worry
about how much is bound to w.

243
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,240
So it's going to be 0.

244
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,110
And this is in the
limit of Kw going to 0.

245
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,310
And so when is it that
something starts happening?

246
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,656

247
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:34,010
AUDIENCE: 1x is the
concentration of w.

248
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,090
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it's when you get n.

249
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,860
And is it the
concentration of w,

250
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,965
or is it-- maybe we can be
a little bit more precise?

251
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,340
What shall I
actually write here?

252
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,030
Should I just write w, or
should I write-- w total, right.

253
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,190
Because the free w is
changing all the time.

254
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,490
And indeed, at you approach
here, the free w goes to--

255
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,650

256
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,150
AUDIENCE: 0.

257
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,180
PROFESSOR: 0, right.

258
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,220
So over here, the
free w is equal to wt.

259
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,010
But then it decreases
linearly until you get here.

260
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,360
And now, there's no free w.

261
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,370
And it's at that stage
that this free x is going

262
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,110
to go up with a slope of what?

263
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,300

264
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,880
1, right?

265
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,520
Right, exactly.

266
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,210
All the x that you add
just turns into free x,

267
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,680
so this goes up with slope 1.

268
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,080

269
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,770
So this is the idea
behind this mechanism.

270
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,210
What I'm drawing is the case
of perfect sequestration.

271
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,990
And in this case,
what happens is,

272
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:46,810
if you look at the
production rate of y,

273
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,886
it's a function
again of x total.

274
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,010
The production rate in here
is to be equal to what?

275
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,431

276
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:53,930
0.

277
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,870

278
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,690
Until you get to this wt, and
then it's going to come up.

279
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,311
And how is it going to come up?

280
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,435
Does it immediately come
all the way up to maximal?

281
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,960

282
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,244
No, so what determines how
rapidly that's going to happen?

283
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,185
AUDIENCE: The
concentration of free x.

284
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,810
PROFESSOR: The
concentration of free x.

285
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,440
And we actually know what
the concentration of free x

286
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,940
is here now.

287
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,570

288
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,470
AUDIENCE: The Kd.

289
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,770
PROFESSOR: Right, so it's
the Kd of the binding.

290
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,110
So this is going to
be some-- so this

291
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,310
is again a Michaelis-Menten
looking kind of curve,

292
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,610
where the half maximal
here is just going

293
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,850
to be this wt plus that Kd.

294
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,930

295
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,210
All right, so there's a sense
that this is ultra-sensitive,

296
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,152
because initially you don't
get much of any expression,

297
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:49,610
then all of a sudden you start
getting significant amounts.

298
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,279

299
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,820
Are there any questions about
the basic-- the intuition here?

300
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,680
We still have come back
and think a little bit more

301
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,096
carefully, kind
of quantitatively,

302
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:04,620
about what this mechanism means
for the other comparisons?

303
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,370
But at least, based on this idea
of the perfect situation, where

304
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,872
the sequestration of
w with x is complete,

305
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,580
then this is the idea
of what's going on.

306
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,800

307
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,930
Is it clear right now?

308
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,864
Yeah.

309
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:26,534
AUDIENCE: What's the direction
of Kw in this situation?

310
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:27,480
Is that--

311
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,040
PROFESSOR: In what
I'm drawing here?

312
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,410
AUDIENCE: What you drew there.

313
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,690
PROFESSOR: This one?

314
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:40,460
Oh, OK, so the definition of
kw is going to be that kw--

315
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,127
and this is a definition.

316
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,710
It has units of
concentration, so that

317
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,670
means we have to put up--
this a conservation of w,

318
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,454
a concentration of x,
the concentration of wx.

319
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,897
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

320
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:59,190

321
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,982
PROFESSOR: Any other
questions about this?

322
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:03,482
Yeah.

323
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,967
AUDIENCE: Why does the
flow go the free x 1,

324
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:08,452
because isn't the free x
now binding with the gene?

325
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,618
PROFESSOR: OK, right, so
this is what we were saying

326
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:14,060
is that there's just
one copy of this gene.

327
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,920
So given that there might
be-- where in this case,

328
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,040
this might be 1,000
of these proteins,

329
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,359
and then it's just not
a significant-- yeah,

330
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:21,859
in the back?

331
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,531
AUDIENCE: So whenever
you have a k,

332
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,739
do have always concentration?

333
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:28,099

334
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:34,350
PROFESSOR: OK, so in this
class whenever possible,

335
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,560
at least in the
lectures, we'll always

336
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,340
try stick with the dissociation
constant, which is the guy that

337
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,320
has units of concentration.

338
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,030
You can also talk about
the association constant,

339
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,330
and then they also
use k for that.

340
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,090
Horribly confusing, right?

341
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,008
So whenever possible, I'll be
referring to the dissociation

342
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:53,508
constant.

343
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:56,854

344
00:17:56,854 --> 00:18:00,354
AUDIENCE: Is that written
a lower case k or a big K?

345
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:01,520
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's right.

346
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,170
No, it's a good
thing that my K's

347
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,456
are so clearly big
K's that there's

348
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,080
no possible source
for confusion there.

349
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,060

350
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,690
Yes.

351
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,254
But if you're ever confused
about which K or whatnot

352
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,670
I'm referring to,
please just ask.

353
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,315

354
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,690
All right, any other questions
about the basic mechanism?

355
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,600
Yeah.

356
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,808
AUDIENCE: Just a correct one.

357
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:26,159
So if we take the other
limit for Kd going to 0,

358
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,549
would it be the same--
so free x versus x total,

359
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,215
would it be the same
slope, but starting

360
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,530
from 0 that should be left?

361
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,280
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

362
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
The other limit
of Kd going to 0.

363
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,300
Yeah, this is an
interesting point.

364
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,440
Right, so I think this
plot is independent of Kd,

365
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,740
because binding to
that promoter doesn't

366
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,650
affect the free concentration
of x anyways, right?

367
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,850
It does affect this,
though, because if Kd

368
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,094
gets smaller and smaller,
then this curve actually

369
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,135
gets more and more steep.

370
00:18:55,135 --> 00:19:00,180

371
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,431
Does that answer your question?

372
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:03,889
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that more sensitive

373
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,530
if the curve is deeper?

374
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,640
PROFESSOR: OK, right, OK.

375
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,300
Yes, OK, that's a good point.

376
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,550
But now you're taking two
limits of things going to 0,

377
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,841
so we have to be a little
bit careful, because it still

378
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,950
maybe depends on the
relationship between those two

379
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,220
as they go to 0.

380
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:25,190

381
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,370
No, that's fair.

382
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,790
But the idea is that if you're
in this other limit, then

383
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,735
you end up not having
significant sequestration

384
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:39,290
in the sense that as
you start adding x,

385
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,320
you start getting expression
of that protein early on.

386
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,410
And so then the whole
mechanism doesn't work.

387
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,535
So it's true that in
principle that thing is steep,

388
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,367
but it was never
inhibited to begin with.

389
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,950
Because the moment
you start adding x,

390
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,740
you start getting
expression from the gene.

391
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,930

392
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,700
Other questions about that?

393
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,450
Let's try out this next one.

394
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,828
Now, this is a question of K--
so this is the binding affinity

395
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:13,290
of x to that
sequesterer as compared

396
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,190
to the total amount of that w.

397
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,220
All right, so what's going
to be the requirement there?

398
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,300
So we'll go ahead and
give you 30 seconds to--

399
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,800
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, but don't
we already have what we want?

400
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,449

401
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,530
What's the more
specific question?

402
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,000
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, so here, this

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,850
is the case where
w went to zero.

404
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,210
Sorry, Kw went to 0.

405
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,970
Right?

406
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,550
And indeed, this works.

407
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,271
And the question
is, in general--

408
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:42,020
Kw is not actually
going to be equal to 0.

409
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,710

410
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,370
And it might be relevant
for this question still.

411
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:52,360

412
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,990
Yeah, because in some ways,
this is the idealized version,

413
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,660
and any real thing
is going to have just

414
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,910
some numbers for these things.

415
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,840
The question is, will
those numbers work.

416
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:30,560

417
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,820
Do you need more time?

418
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,350
Let's go ahead and
make our best guess.

419
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,800
In order to get
ultra-sensitivity response of y

420
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,072
to the concentration of x,
what is that you need here?

421
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:42,780
All right, ready.

422
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,735
Three, two, one.

423
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:47,680

424
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,925
So we got some A's,
some B's, some D's.

425
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,205
C is not very popular.

426
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:58,460

427
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,062
OK, so it seems like--
Well, why don't we

428
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,520
just go ahead and
spend 30 seconds?

429
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:04,960
Turn your neighbor.

430
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,376
You should be able to find
someone who disagrees with you.

431
00:22:07,376 --> 00:23:03,715
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

432
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,840
PROFESSOR: OK, why don't
we go ahead and reconvene,

433
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,080
and you can give your
argument to the group?

434
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,420
All right, does somebody want
to volunteer an explanation?

435
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,568

436
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:17,510
Yeah.

437
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,870
AUDIENCE: I haven't had time
to test this explanation.

438
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,036
PROFESSOR: That's just fine.

439
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:22,740
Well, your neighbor
will appreciate it.

440
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,820
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
that the time scale of that

441
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,660
axis really on the
second graph is

442
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,670
set by how quickly that slope,
the curving slope, rises?

443
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,380
PROFESSOR: OK. so times scale
I'm a little bit worried about.

444
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,630
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
concentration scale.

445
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,671
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

446
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:46,605
AUDIENCE: It's set by how
quickly the second curve rises,

447
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:50,871
so once you go above 0.

448
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,094
That's the only
feature on that graph.

449
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:57,503
And that should be in a
Michaelis-Menten curve that's

450
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:58,750
determined by K.

451
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,865
PROFESSOR: K, which K?

452
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:03,335
AUDIENCE: Oh, the K of the Kd.

453
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:03,960
PROFESSOR: Yes.

454
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,760
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

455
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,410
PROFESSOR: OK,
right, so I think I

456
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,368
like everything you're
saying, although I think

457
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:11,930
you're about to answer the next
one, although the next one,

458
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,086
I think, is in some ways the
hardest one, so you're ready.

459
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:18,430
AUDIENCE: Right,
which we determined

460
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,774
should be a lot more than Kw.

461
00:24:20,774 --> 00:24:23,190
PROFESSOR: Right, so we know
that Kd should be a lot a lot

462
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,582
more than Kw.

463
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:31,016
AUDIENCE: And I think that this
should be a decent amount less

464
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:35,712
than-- Sorry, so I think that
Kd should be a decent amount

465
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:36,884
smaller than w2.

466
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:38,300
PROFESSOR: All
right, so you think

467
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,720
Kd should be a decent
amount smaller than w2.

468
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,250
OK, so you really are
answering the next question.

469
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,440
AUDIENCE: But no, I
think this is important.

470
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,754
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, I
agree it's important.

471
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:51,254
But--

472
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:55,550

473
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,757
AUDIENCE: Basically speaking,
if you let wt become too small,

474
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:04,170
then it compares into
everything else, all

475
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,944
the relevant quantities, then
this feature, which is really

476
00:25:06,944 --> 00:25:09,686
determining the over-sensitivity
strengths have 0 side.

477
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,060
That's what I wanted to say.

478
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,730
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

479
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,070
I very much like
that explanation.

480
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,110
And since we have it on tape, we
can now play it again in a few

481
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:25,690
minutes and then-- I think
you're making a very nice

482
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,840
argument, and actually,
we'll go ahead and even--

483
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,302

484
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:31,760
Does anybody want
to argue against.

485
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,259
Yeah.

486
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,920

487
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,980
So what he's arguing is
that what you-- So he's

488
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,410
actually arguing that
it's this over here, which

489
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,410
is that what sets the scale
that this thing increases by

490
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,030
is the Kd.

491
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,370

492
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,980
And you want this
thing to come up

493
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,950
quickly relative to this other
scale, which is the total w.

494
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,700
So if total w is
just too small here,

495
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,360
then it's not like you get
any ultra-sensitive response,

496
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,280
because you want it
to be low, low low,

497
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,090
and then come up
kind of quickly.

498
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,694
So there's some
sense that you want

499
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:09,860
this scale to be of the
order of this scale or maybe

500
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,630
even a bit shorter.

501
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,040
Is that-- and I agree that this
actually one that generates

502
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,090
a lot of argument an
discussion in general,

503
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:25,180
because I think that
reasonable people can disagree.

504
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,144
I think this is actually-- I
will side with you on this.

505
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:35,250

506
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,250
But what about this, because you
haven't said anything about KW.

507
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,140
AUDIENCE I think that
combining one and three.

508
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,285
PROFESSOR: OK, OK, fine.

509
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,160
AUDIENCE: That's why I
was trying to answer--

510
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,000
PROFESSOR: OK, no.

511
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,860
OK, fair.

512
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,500
But it's just too
many logical leaps.

513
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,320
I think it's true.

514
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,710
And there's a reason I ordered
the questions in this way,

515
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,720
so that is so this one
you could-- Otherwise,

516
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,390
I agree that if you combine
these things, you do get--

517
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,256
and which one do you get?

518
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:05,332
AUDIENCE: I think A.

519
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,040
PROFESSOR: Is that
what other people got?

520
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,960

521
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,820
OK, I agree that actually
you can get to A here

522
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,490
from the combination
of C and B here.

523
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,940
But it's a little bit crazy.

524
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,520
Is there a more direct
explanation we can get?

525
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,380
Yeah, go ahead.

526
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,756
AUDIENCE: Well, if you
don't have a lot of w,

527
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:30,853
then your binding is
too sensitive in a way.

528
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:32,436
You'll add a little
bit of x, and then

529
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:34,227
the binding will be
all used up, and you'll

530
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,290
be making y immediately.

531
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,190
You want a lot of w to be able
to soak up a sizeable amount--

532
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
then maybe in the back.

533
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,318
AUDIENCE: So originally,
I agreed, but that just

534
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:52,800
makes you switch, like Evy
said, you can sequester less,

535
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,415
but that still gives you
a sense of [INAUDIBLE].

536
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,456
You're more sensitive to
fluctuations if you have

537
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:04,970
a lower sequestration capacity,
but it doesn't really change--

538
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,627
You still have that switch--

539
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:07,460
PROFESSOR: Sure, OK.

540
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,610
So I think that this is
actually [INAUDIBLE],

541
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,610
because there are two ways of
having more of this wt helps.

542
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,220
One is that it pushes this
boundary further to the right.

543
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,809
But the other is that it makes
it a better sequestering agent

544
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,850
because there are just
more of these w's to bind.

545
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,891
And if you go and you do
you do the calculations,

546
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:28,030
and I encourage you to do
it, what you actually find

547
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,310
is that the
concentration of free x

548
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,280
is given approximately
by x total divided

549
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,870
by wt over K sub w.

550
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,370
So what you see is that the free
concentration of x-- and this

551
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,900
is in the region.

552
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:54,360
This is for x total less
than and maybe significantly

553
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,030
less than w total.

554
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,350
But the idea is that when
you're in this sequestering

555
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,200
regime, what we see is
that the concentration of x

556
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,020
is going to increase
linearly with the total x.

557
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,800
But it's going to be sort
of suppressed by this amount

558
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:16,060
here, where this ratio
is much larger than 1.

559
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,200
You want to be much
more than 1, wt over Kw.

560
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,280
And this is telling you how
good of a sequesterer this guy,

561
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,160
this w is, because you
want to bind tightly

562
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,787
and you need to
have kind of enough

563
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:28,828
to keep the free concentration
of x from growing.

564
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:38,140

565
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,050
Yes.

566
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,050
AUDIENCE: So that's what
I was thinking as well,

567
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,018
but then I was wondering
if there's too much of w,

568
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:49,482
then wouldn't x never bind
completely, but always

569
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:50,735
get sequestered?

570
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,610
PROFESSOR: So this is
a very important point,

571
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,790
which is that it needs to be
possible for the cell to make

572
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,830
enough x to overcome the w.

573
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,700
If there's so much of the
sequestering protein that you

574
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,016
cannot even get beyond
that, then you're never--

575
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,640
It's true that you might have a
nice ultra-sensitive switch out

576
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,280
there, but you just
can't get there.

577
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,737
So yeah, this is certainly
relevant as well.

578
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:21,210

579
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,430
All right, incidentally, if you
plot free x as a function of xT

580
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:35,830
on a log-log scale,
the question is

581
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,020
what is it going to look like?

582
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,770
Now we, know that
on a linear scale,

583
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,330
it looks something like that.

584
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:51,591
So if it's on a log-log
scale, question is--

585
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,340
And log-log is nice
because you can really

586
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,270
get the full dynamic
range of what's going on.

587
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,280
If you plot x and
this is free x,

588
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:16,379
as a function of x total in this
regime for large X and x total,

589
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:18,045
what is it going to
end up looking like?

590
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:25,242

591
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,230
AUDIENCE: It's a straight line.

592
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,401
PROFESSOR: It's a straight line.

593
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:31,900
And eventually, it's going to
be straight line with slope 1,

594
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:38,320
actually, because they're just
linearly related to each other.

595
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,680
Now, down in the
low regime, what

596
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,880
is it going to look like
well below this region of wt?

597
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,200

598
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,245
AUDIENCE:You should also get
a straight line with 1 slope.

599
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:56,370
PROFESSOR: With what slope?

600
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,420
AUDIENCE: With 1
over [INAUDIBLE].

601
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,340
PROFESSOR: OK, so why
does everybody agree?

602
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,840
No, we have a disagreeable--
Right, so what's the--

603
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,976
AUDIENCE: It's going to be
also slope 1, but just lower.

604
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:12,850
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

605
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,680
So it's actually also
slope 1, but it has

606
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,349
a lower-- This is dangerous.

607
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,140
This is why I brought
this up, because it's

608
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,580
really easy to look at these
things and think that-- Yeah,

609
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,940
because they're still linearly
related to each other.

610
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,310
So when you take the logs,
it just affects the level.

611
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,950
So you still get the
same slope, but it's

612
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,950
going to be down here somewhere.

613
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,130
And then in this regime, you
get this ultra-- this thing

614
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,120
where it goes up suddenly.

615
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,280
One thing that I strongly
encourage everyone to do

616
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,070
is, in these sorts
of problems, it's

617
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,420
wonderful to spend
time-- Oh, sorry.

618
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,035
This is log.

619
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,810

620
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,600
Free x log of xT.

621
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,930
It's really very
valuable to plot things

622
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,939
in multiple different ways, by
hand or by the computer or both

623
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,980
or whatnot, just to make
sure that you're keeping

624
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,580
track of what's going on.

625
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,400
Because often what you
see and what you think

626
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,880
is very different
depending on what you plot.

627
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,510
And you'd like to be able to
see your problem from as many

628
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,718
different angles as possible.

629
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:19,487

630
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:21,070
All right, I think
that we've probably

631
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,160
spent about as much time
on this as we ought to.

632
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,850
But are there any
other questions

633
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:32,150
about how this is
going to come about?

634
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,650
Yes

635
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,560
AUDIENCE: Are there any
negative autoregulation

636
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,440
that can use sequestration to
get a switch-like [INAUDIBLE]?

637
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,990
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
an interesting question,

638
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,814
although we have to be
careful about-- If you really

639
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,730
want it to be more
switch-like, you'd probably

640
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,050
use positive autoregulation.

641
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,960
And I'm not aware
of a case where

642
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,404
this has been combined,
although-- It's

643
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,320
likely there are some.

644
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,278
I just don't know them.

645
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:04,040

646
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,829
I'm going to switch gears to
this autoregulation, which

647
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,120
is something, of course, that
you guys just read about.

648
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,440
And it looked like your
understanding of it was solid.

649
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,719
But we want to move through
these different ideas.

650
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,340
First, this idea
of a network motif.

651
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,500
And this is just the simplest
example of a network motif.

652
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,480
And it's so simple,
we often don't even

653
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,850
call it a network motif.

654
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,850
But the idea here is that
we have some network,

655
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,690
and it has maybe N
nodes and E edges.

656
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,550

657
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,310
And the example that they give,
that Uri gives in his book, N

658
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:55,760
was 420, and E was 520.

659
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,934
,

660
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,600
And there's a basic
question that if you

661
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,140
have a network with N nodes and
then you have directed edges--

662
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,010
these are edges that have an
arrow pointing on one end.

663
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,180
Now, in that case, and if
you allow self-directed ,

664
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,870
edges how many possible
edges are there?

665
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,920
Does anybody remember
what this looks like?

666
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,840

667
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,820
AUDIENCE: More than
20 possible, right?

668
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,780
PROFESSOR: What's that?

669
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
AUDIENCE: There'd be
more than 20 possible.

670
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,154
PROFESSOR: Right, not even in
terms of the actual number.

671
00:35:29,154 --> 00:35:32,157
Just in terms of N, for example.

672
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:36,380
AUDIENCE: Total or
just self-directed?

673
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,810
PROFESSOR: Total self-directed.

674
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,510
Or Sorry, total directed
edges, total number

675
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,307
of possible directed edges,
if we included self edges,

676
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:47,530
I guess.

677
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,330
N squared.

678
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,060
And you can think about
this in multiple ways.

679
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,730
One is just that, well, you can
start at any of the N nodes.

680
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,350
And you can end at
any of the N nodes,

681
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,120
and that gives you N squared.

682
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,170
Right?

683
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,220
But there's another way that
you could-- For instance,

684
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,965
this is Emacs.

685
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:07,070

686
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,610
It's NE N squared.

687
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,190
You could also think about this,
if you like, as just-- say,

688
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:20,650
well, as they point out, there's
sort of-- 1/2 N times N minus 1

689
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,760
is the total number of
pairs in the network.

690
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,449
And then for each
of the pairs, you

691
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,240
can have an edge pointing
either direction,

692
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,100
so that gives you a 2.

693
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,510
Plus, you can have
N self edges, right?

694
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,985

695
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,860
Now, of course, these
are just different ways

696
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,957
of counting N squared.

697
00:36:39,957 --> 00:36:42,290
But it's useful to just think
about it in different ways

698
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,790
to make sure that
you're comfortable

699
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,670
with the combinatorics of it.

700
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,136
In particular, because next
week or the week after that,

701
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,760
we're going to be
talking about network

702
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
motifs in more detail, in
particular the feed-forward

703
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,660
loop.

704
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,990
And then we really
have to keep track

705
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,614
of these sorts of
combinatorics better.

706
00:36:57,614 --> 00:37:00,500

707
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,530
The way that Uri thinks
about this is he says,

708
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,340
all right, well,
we're going to invoke

709
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:11,070
this null model of a network,
this Erdos-Renyi network, where

710
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:18,000
we just simply say we're going
to assign the E edges randomly

711
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,039
across the Emacs possible.

712
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,580
So of all possible
edges, we're going

713
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,980
to place the edges
randomly and then

714
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,570
I generate some random network.

715
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,290

716
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,820
So this is basically
what we typically

717
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,890
call a random network.

718
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,540
And that's going to allow
us to define some null model

719
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,340
that if everything
were random, we

720
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,515
can ask, for example, how many
self edges do expect to get?

721
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:49,544

722
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:51,960
Well, one way to construct
this sort Erdos-Renyi network--

723
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,456
Yeah.

724
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:53,955
AUDIENCE: But how
do you know if you

725
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,672
have other kind of constraints
in the system, how do

726
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:02,609
you know that transcription
might require in some cases

727
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:03,275
autoregulation--

728
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:06,230

729
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,791
The answer that was give that
was a good answer was that

730
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:12,152
evolution is the
only thing that can--

731
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:14,610
if you find a network motif
that has to do with evolution--

732
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,660
PROFESSOR: So that is the
argument that Uri makes,

733
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,034
and you're maybe saying maybe
that's not a good argument.

734
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:23,449
And what Uri is saying as
well, if you see these networks

735
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:24,990
more frequently than
you would expect

736
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,406
by chance-- and
of course, you can

737
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:29,000
define what you mean
by chance-- then

738
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,930
you can say oh, maybe it was
select for, it was evolved.

739
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,850
And I think that, in the case
of this autoregulation case,

740
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,070
I think the results
are not very sensitive.

741
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,630
But I think that this question
of what the right null model

742
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,960
is, is a real issue, especially
when you're talking about some

743
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
of these other networks.

744
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,918
And what we'll see for
the feed-forward loop is

745
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,820
that you have to decide-- well,
one thing we're going to see

746
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,610
is an Erdos-Renyi random network
is very much not an accurate

747
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,335
description of real
transcription networks.

748
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,710
So then you could say, well,
that's not a good null model

749
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,720
to use.

750
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,771
And so we'll definitely
spend some more time thinking

751
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:05,270
about this.

752
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,821

753
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,570
In the context of the
Erdos-Renyi network,

754
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,700
though, one way that
you can generate it

755
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,140
is that for each of
the Emacs possible,

756
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
each of these total
number of edges,

757
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,040
there is some
probability that you're

758
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,980
going to actually place
a real edge there.

759
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,659
And that probability is
just E over N squared.

760
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:26,700
E is the number of edges.

761
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,040
N squared is the number
of possible edges.

762
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,720
So if you just create a
random network in that way,

763
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,640
then this is a manifestation
of a random network that

764
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,320
has at least the basic
properties, the same number

765
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,740
of edges as our network.

766
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,520
So from this, you say, well,
how many self edges would

767
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,070
you expect in this world?

768
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:01,380
And you'd say well,
in that case--

769
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,760
There are two ways of
thinking about this.

770
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,150
So you can either say,
we're going to take,

771
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,490
for each of the N
edges, there's one

772
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,040
possible self-directed arrow.

773
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,990
And for each of those cases,
we can just multiply this by P.

774
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:27,380
And this gives us E over N.

775
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,370
You could also think
about it as-- There

776
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,387
are multiple ways once
again, of doing the counting.

777
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:38,470
In an Erdos-Renyi network,
you can say, all right,

778
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:44,300
you would expect to get roughly
E over N autoregulatory loops.

779
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,360
And this is of order 1.

780
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,130

781
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,320
So this is 1.2, in the case of
the network that Uri analyzes

782
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,482
in his book and his paper.

783
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:58,815
Whereas, how many were actually
observing in the network

784
00:40:58,815 --> 00:40:59,481
that he studied?

785
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:03,034

786
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:03,950
AUDIENCE: 40.

787
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,910
PROFESSOR: There were 40, right?

788
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,820
So in the observed
transcriptional network--

789
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:13,550
and this is in E. coli-- he
found that there were 40.

790
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,730
And the basic statement
here is that 40 is just

791
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,904
much larger than 1.2.

792
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:20,820
And you can quantify
this a little bit better,

793
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,310
because, it's really you
would expect 1.2 plus or minus

794
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,310
the square root of this, in
a random network like this.

795
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,960
But that is, you'd
expect 0, 1, 2, maybe 3.

796
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,620
So 40 is definitely not
what you would expect based

797
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,885
on an Erdos-Renyi network.

798
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:41,010
So this is the sense in
which it's a network motif.

799
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,870
It's that the
observed network just

800
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,820
doesn't look like a random
network in this very

801
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,910
particular sense.

802
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,310
And of these 40, does anybody
remember kind the distribution

803
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:58,290
between negative autoregulation
and positive autoregulation?

804
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,790
AUDIENCE: It was
30-10 or something.

805
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
think it was like 34

806
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,130
and 6 was my recollection.

807
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,330
I didn't write this down.

808
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,190
So most of these guys have
a form of x inhibiting x.

809
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,850
But some had the form
of x activating x.

810
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,809
So this was something
like 34 and 6.

811
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,100
What you would say then is
that negative autoregulation

812
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,830
is a very strong network motif,
whereas positive autoregulation

813
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,610
is a weaker network
motif, but still

814
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,452
something that occurs
perhaps more than you

815
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,410
would expect by chance.

816
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:32,060

817
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,570
Are there any questions about
that where that argument came

818
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,980
from, other concerns about it?

819
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,216

820
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:46,340
All right, then from this,
then Uri says, OK, well,

821
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,290
maybe these things
evolved for a reason.

822
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,690
And so what we'll do in the next
half hour just argue or discuss

823
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,260
what possible
evolutionary advantages

824
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,913
such a social network
motif might have.

825
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:01,412
Yeah.

826
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,196
AUDIENCE: Can you really
propose adversarial explanations

827
00:43:04,196 --> 00:43:04,909
like that?

828
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,950
PROFESSOR: Oh, you can
propose whatever you want.

829
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,934
AUDIENCE: I know, but it
doesn't have much value.

830
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:12,375
It's unquantifiable.

831
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,000
PROFESSOR: Yes.

832
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,090
No, I'd say this is a
major issue in a lot

833
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,160
of evolutionary arguments.

834
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,690
And I would say that the
purpose of ideas and hypotheses

835
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,570
is to get you to go and
make new measurements.

836
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,410
And so right now, we're
the stage, OK, well,

837
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,440
maybe these things are occurring
more frequently than you

838
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,650
would expect by chance.

839
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,830
So now, we can just
sit down and think, oh,

840
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,450
what advantage might it give.

841
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,800
And then we can go and
try to experimentally ask

842
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,449
whether those advantages
are at least manifested

843
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:40,115
in real systems.

844
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:42,430
It doesn't prove that
that's why they evolved,

845
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,460
but it makes you more
comfortable with the argument.

846
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,960
feel

847
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,702
Ultimately, we assign some--
we have some agent probability

848
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,660
somewhere in our brain.

849
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,330
And the more
evidence that we can

850
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,700
accumulate that's consistent
with these ideas, the more

851
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,510
likely that we think it is.

852
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,100
But in general, you
don't prove things

853
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,120
in this sort of
evolutionary space the way

854
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,426
you prove things in
many other fields.

855
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:04,925
Yeah.

856
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:08,760
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's
hard to call this an argument.

857
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,754
It feels more like
just an observation.

858
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,670
PROFESSOR: Which thing
is an argument versus--

859
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,445
AUDIENCE: I guess the thing
is it should be evolutionarily

860
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:19,885
advantageous,
that's an argument,

861
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:22,010
but essentially, the whole
thing is an observation,

862
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,340
and then there's a little bit
of an argument in the end.

863
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I will
let each person decide

864
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,650
what fraction and observation.

865
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,010

866
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,010
Yeah, I don't feel
especially strongly about it.

867
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,630

868
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,980
My guess is that it did
evolve it because it

869
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,970
provides some useful function.

870
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,210
And therefore, I think
it's valuable to explore

871
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,830
what those useful
functions might be.

872
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,650
But for example, it's
very hard to know

873
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,580
which of these explanation--
this thing about

874
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,800
increasing the response
time, or sorry,

875
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,690
increasing the response
rate as compared

876
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,370
to increasing robustness,
how do you decide

877
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,369
which one's more important?

878
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,160
Then I think, once
again, reasonable people

879
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,743
can disagree about
these things, yeah.

880
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:11,984

881
00:45:11,984 --> 00:45:13,900
So first negative
autoregulation, because this

882
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,816
is the one that is the
stronger network motif.

883
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,910

884
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:22,910
I think that the book does
a nice explanation of why

885
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,445
it decreases the response time.

886
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:30,580

887
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,880
OK, we can just ask.

888
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,620

889
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,370
OK, response time-- and this is
for a negative autoregulation.

890
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,450

891
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,360
Response time goes down.

892
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:59,130
And is this for turning on, off,
both, or maybe neither, or E,

893
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,220
don't know.

894
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,550
And I'll give you just 10
seconds to think about this.

895
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,470
It's nice if you
just remember it,

896
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,810
but it's also maybe even better
if you can figure it out.

897
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,821
Because in a week,
you're probably

898
00:46:10,821 --> 00:46:12,320
not going to just
have it memorized,

899
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,610
but you should be able to
think through the logic of it

900
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:18,734
and understand why this
is going to be what it is.

901
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:26,150

902
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,580
All right, so the question
is, negative autoregulation,

903
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,740
maybe it does something.

904
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,283
Maybe it decreases
the response time.

905
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:34,657
But does it decrease
the response

906
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:39,610
time for turning a gene on,
for turning it off, for both,

907
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,013
neither, or don't know

908
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:42,554
AUDIENCE:When you
say turning it off,

909
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:44,800
what exactly is the
process you're imagining.

910
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,340
PROFESSOR: I'm imagining a
process where the expression

911
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,540
turns off immediately.

912
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,110
So there's a signal
that just stops--

913
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,520
AUDIENCE: what
transcription can go ahead.

914
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,270
PROFESSOR: Right,
so then it's just

915
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:04,080
I chop up all the polymerases,
and no more expression.

916
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,180
But so a signal comes and tells
the polymerases to stop making.

917
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:07,680
Yeah.

918
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,850

919
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,350
All right, so do
you need more time?

920
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,430

921
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:18,930
No.

922
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,270
Ready, three, two, one.

923
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:25,630

924
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,240
All right, so we actually are
all over the place on this.

925
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,290

926
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,210
OK, turn to your neighbor.

927
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,885
And you should be
able to explain

928
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,885
one way or the other why
thi-- what is going on.

929
00:47:37,885 --> 00:49:06,880
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

930
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,050
Let's go ahead and reconvene.

931
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:11,150
I just want to remind
everybody that when

932
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,620
I say simple regulation,
there's no autoregulation.

933
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,140
It's just responding
to a signal.

934
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:24,050
That for a stable protein,
the time to get to say,

935
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,840
for example, half
saturating concentration

936
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,210
here is defined by the
cell generation time.

937
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:33,170
And that's true for turning
on and for turning off.

938
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,810
And what was the
strategy that you

939
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,550
could use if you wanted
to decrease the response

940
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,344
time in this situation?

941
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:43,010
AUDIENCE: Increase
the degradation rate.

942
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:46,140
PROFESSOR: Right, so you could
increase the degradation rate.

943
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,925
And does that the
on, off, or both?

944
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:49,550
AUDIENCE: Both.

945
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,470
PROFESSOR: Both.

946
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,992
But there's a cost,
which was what?

947
00:49:52,992 --> 00:49:54,450
AUDIENCE: You have
to make protein.

948
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,960
PROFESSOR: Right, you have
to make a bunch of protein,

949
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,920
and then you're just
going to chop it

950
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,045
up right after you make it.

951
00:49:58,045 --> 00:50:01,230

952
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,540
There is a reasonable-- there
is a way to make things faster,

953
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,850
but it has a significant cost.

954
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,710
The question is, if you have
negative autoregulation--

955
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:14,520
so in this case, you have x
that is repressing itself--

956
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,830
what is it that
it's going to do?

957
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,664
Is it going to affect the on
time, the off time, or both.

958
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:20,830
Let's just see where we are.

959
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,390
Ready, three, two, one.

960
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:27,140

961
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,200
OK, so it's interesting.

962
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,620
We're moving
towards C, it seems.

963
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,370
OK, so can somebody
give me an explanation

964
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:44,214
for C. Did we read the chapter?

965
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:45,672
AUDIENCE: Well,
the chapter doesn't

966
00:50:45,672 --> 00:50:48,528
discuss the effect of negative
autoregulation and turning off.

967
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,432
I don't think it does.

968
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:52,360
PROFESSOR: Wow,
it's a good thing

969
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,200
we're doing that here then.

970
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,700
All right.

971
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,300

972
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,760
So first of all, can somebody
give the explanation.

973
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,305
Does T on go up,
down, or sideways.

974
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:05,550
AUDIENCE: Up.

975
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,035
PROFESSOR: So T on-- It's
the time that goes down.

976
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:09,160
I always get this confused.

977
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,500
So time is the one that goes
down, so the rate goes up.

978
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,101
Negative autoregulation is
faster turning on, we decided.

979
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:16,600
Right?

980
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,664

981
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:23,580
And does somebody want
to give the explanation

982
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,340
for why this is?

983
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,602

984
00:51:27,602 --> 00:51:32,060
AUDIENCE: Well, your
equilibrium level is lower.

985
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

986
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:34,605
Yeah, exactly.

987
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:36,438
Yes, this is actually
surprisingly difficult

988
00:51:36,438 --> 00:51:40,290
to explain even though
it's not a deep concept.

989
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,640
But the idea is that you
start out expressing a lot,

990
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,502
so that if you had kept on
expressing that high level,

991
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:48,210
you would have done
some exponential-- It

992
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,140
would have take cell generation
time from way up here.

993
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,040
But instead, what happens
is that you shoot on up.

994
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,510
But then, once you get up
here, you repress expression.

995
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,490
So then you get an
effective thing,

996
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,790
where the time it takes you get
half of your equilibrium, that

997
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,510
goes down.

998
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,540
So Tl in here is
shorter than here.

999
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,282

1000
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:13,781
Yes.

1001
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:16,560
AUDIENCE: So in
negative autoregulation,

1002
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,440
for decreasing what
the book calls beta,

1003
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,450
to have the same steady state?

1004
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,450
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1005
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,160
The initial beta, that
rate, that maximal rate

1006
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,100
of expression, that
goes up in a case

1007
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,330
of negative autoregulation.

1008
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,750
But then you start
repressing expression

1009
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,301
once your
concentration of x here

1010
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:36,550
gets to some reasonable level.

1011
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:41,670

1012
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:48,090
So now we're just talking
about production rate of x.

1013
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,900
And that's as a function of x.

1014
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,770
And of this logic
approximation is when it just

1015
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,850
is maximal until
it gets to some K

1016
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,060
and then is
completely repressed.

1017
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,370
So real versions will
be much smoother,

1018
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,320
but this is just useful to
start getting the intuition.

1019
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,420

1020
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,780
And the idea is that
you shoot up to this K,

1021
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,110
and then you stop expressing.

1022
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,711
In this limit, actually, it's
not even-- it's like a kink

1023
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:22,210
here.

1024
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,210
Because it just shoots up
and then it turns around.

1025
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:29,040
But any real system
will be smoother.

1026
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,045
Yes, question.

1027
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:32,520
AUDIENCE: So if you get to
a certain equilibrium level,

1028
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,490
then in autoregulation, you
would need a stronger promoter.

1029
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,040
PROFESSOR: Yes, you want a
stronger promoter, because you

1030
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,750
really want to have high
expression initially

1031
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,700
and then later repress that.

1032
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,070
So negative autoregulation
allows you to speed up

1033
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,450
turning on, so T on goes down.

1034
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,075
AUDIENCE: Without
increasing the promoter,

1035
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:56,075
which is a good thing,
because someone would die

1036
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:58,110
if you increase the promoter.

1037
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,604
PROFESSOR: This is a
very important point,

1038
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:04,020
which I was about
to get to, which

1039
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:10,050
is that this is something that
was done-- We could have done

1040
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,720
that without negative
autoregulation

1041
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,512
by increasing the
degradation rate.

1042
00:54:13,512 --> 00:54:15,470
So the question the that
we're bringing up here

1043
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:17,860
is, is there that
same cost that we

1044
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,915
were referring to before of this
futile expression of protein

1045
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:21,540
at equilibrium.

1046
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,456

1047
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:25,337
AUDIENCE: No.

1048
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:26,670
PROFESSOR: So it's actually not.

1049
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:31,580

1050
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,770
In a cell, you start
out expressing a lot,

1051
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,440
but then later, you
actually bring down

1052
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,645
your rate of expression.

1053
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:42,490
And in any case,
there's no degradation.

1054
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,140
in this.

1055
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,810
The only effective
degradation is

1056
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,610
due to the dilution,
the growth of the cell.

1057
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,640
So if you have the
same concentration,

1058
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,179
then actually, you don't
make any more protein

1059
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:55,595
than you did here, because you
have the same concentration

1060
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:57,810
at equilibrium.

1061
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,140
So this is neat
because this speeds up

1062
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,640
the response when
you're turning on,

1063
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,249
without the associated
cost of making

1064
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:07,540
that protein then degrading it.

1065
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,662

1066
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,120
Any questions about
that statement?

1067
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,640

1068
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,140
So now what about off?

1069
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,300
Is the off time the same
as the on time here?

1070
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:28,610

1071
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,741
So what sets how fast--

1072
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:33,865
AUDIENCE: Should the off
time be slower because you

1073
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:37,032
have lots of degradation.

1074
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,490
PROFESSOR: Right,
and in principle,

1075
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:42,644
is there any active degradation
that we've invoked on this?

1076
00:55:42,644 --> 00:55:43,970
AUDIENCE: I think not.

1077
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,700
PROFESSOR: Of
course, we could have

1078
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,800
both negative autoregulation
and active degradation.

1079
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,610
But in principle
right now, you can

1080
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,600
have the negative autoregulation
without any active degradation.

1081
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,110
In that case, how long does
it take for that concentration

1082
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,989
to go away when you
stop expressing?

1083
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,530
AUDIENCE: The cell
degeneration time.

1084
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,113
PROFESSOR: The cell
degeneration time.

1085
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:05,360
So this thing actually looks
the exact same as this.

1086
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,090

1087
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:17,000
So these guides are the same,
whereas this one is faster

1088
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,583
than that one.

1089
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,130

1090
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:23,380
Because the idea is that the
best that-- unless you're

1091
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,978
inactively degraded,
all you can do is you

1092
00:56:25,978 --> 00:56:27,270
can shut off expression.

1093
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,060
But then if you
turn off expression

1094
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,560
on the negative
autoregulation, it's

1095
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,530
the exact same thing as
turning off expression

1096
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,530
in the absence of the
neg-- in either case,

1097
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,170
you just stop making protein.

1098
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,560
So the concentration
just goes down

1099
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,140
because it's being diluted
away during cell growth.

1100
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,800
So this is saying
that response time

1101
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,530
was down only when
turning off in the case

1102
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,049
of negative autoregulation.

1103
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:57,195

1104
00:56:57,195 --> 00:56:58,861
Are there any questions
about that idea?

1105
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:02,980

1106
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,480
Yes.

1107
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,452
AUDIENCE: With the
negative autoregulation,

1108
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:08,903
in order to reach the
same protein levels,

1109
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:14,542
you'd need much greater
production rates, correct?

1110
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:21,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the idea
is that this beta might be--

1111
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,680
so this is the beta of
negative autoregulation.

1112
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,269
It could be much larger than
the beta of simple regulation

1113
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:30,935
in order to get to
the same equilibrium.

1114
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:39,480

1115
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,600
OK, so what about this
idea of robustness?

1116
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,830
Well, this is production rate
and then degradation rate.

1117
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,400

1118
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,630
So this is an alpha x.

1119
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,630

1120
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,370
And so my question
here is, I told you

1121
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,420
that robustness-- something
is robust-- Yeah, question.

1122
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,108
AUDIENCE: My question
is in this case,

1123
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:11,900
you're saying that the off
means signal disappears, right?

1124
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,960
PROFESSOR: OK, T
off is this idea.

1125
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,880
It's the T 1/2.

1126
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,870
So this is the time that
it takes for the protein

1127
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,999
concentration to
reach half-- to go

1128
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:27,540
from halfway the distance from
where you were to where you're

1129
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,000
going to end up.

1130
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,992
AUDIENCE: But what if
the signal not disappear,

1131
00:58:29,992 --> 00:58:33,870
but to half of the
original signal?

1132
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:37,051
PROFESSOR: So the signal could
do a range of different things.

1133
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,550
And it could be
that the signal just

1134
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,730
changes so that instead
of going down to 0,

1135
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,860
you go down to some other value.

1136
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,110
Is that what you're imagining?

1137
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:44,693
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1138
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:46,900
PROFESSOR: In that case,
you still go exponentially

1139
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,720
to this new value, so actually
the T-- the response time

1140
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,160
there is still actually
the cell generation time.

1141
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,130
So it doesn't matter,
in the absence

1142
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,000
of any these, for
example, autoregulation.

1143
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,160
The time, the
characteristic timescale,

1144
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,000
is always the cell generation
time if it's a stable protein.

1145
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,999
It doesn't matter whether
you're going up, down,

1146
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,190
or all the way to 0 or not.

1147
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:13,360

1148
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:20,450
So the question here is-- OK, x
equilibrium is robust to what?

1149
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,090

1150
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,340
And this is to small
changes in what?

1151
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:32,120

1152
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,752
It's going to be A, alpha.

1153
00:59:34,752 --> 00:59:48,160

1154
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,410
So this is going to be our
first example of an advanced use

1155
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,540
of our cards.

1156
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,600
So the way that it works is that
you can choose more than one.

1157
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,575
OK, now, this requires
some manual dexterity.

1158
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:03,950
So what you have to do is if
you think that the answer is

1159
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,241
more than one of these things,
then what you have to do

1160
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:07,705
is show me more than one card.

1161
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:12,090

1162
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,700
These cards are amazing, right?

1163
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,960
You can do so many
different combinations.

1164
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,790
I'll give you 20 seconds
to think about it.

1165
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:25,670

1166
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,140
AUDIENCE: So what's e?

1167
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,070
What do those things mean?

1168
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,540
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is, are the equilibrium

1169
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,330
concentration of protein x
is robust means it does not

1170
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:42,000
change in response to small
changes in what quantities?

1171
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,885
So if I change the
degradation rate,

1172
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:45,010
does it change equilibrium.

1173
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,380
If I change the beta.

1174
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,670
And I'm asking about
this case here,

1175
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,150
perfect negative
autoregulation, just

1176
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:55,060
so we can try to establish
our intuition here.

1177
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,840
K is this repression threshold.

1178
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,210
None means that it's not
robust to any of these things.

1179
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:15,600
DK always means "don't know."

1180
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,130
I'll give you an
extra 30 seconds.

1181
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:17,755
This might be--

1182
01:01:17,755 --> 01:01:34,964

1183
01:01:34,964 --> 01:01:36,380
So this one's the
production rate.

1184
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,452
This one's the degradation rate.

1185
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:39,910
This figure might
be useful to you.

1186
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:45,230

1187
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,200
AUDIENCE: Can you
define K again?

1188
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,190
PROFESSOR: Yes, so K is the
concentration of the protein x

1189
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,970
at which this super effective
repression kicks in.

1190
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,080
So we're assuming perfect
negative autoregulation.

1191
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,600
Beta is the rate of expression
for low concentrations.

1192
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,245
The moment you get
to concentration K,

1193
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:08,328
you get perfect repression
and no more expression.

1194
01:02:08,328 --> 01:02:18,540

1195
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,621
Do you need more time?

1196
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:20,120
Question.

1197
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,940
AUDIENCE: By saying that
x equilibrium is robust,

1198
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,640
so you mean that when you
change these perimeters,

1199
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,510
x equilibrium stays exactly the
same, or will x equlibrium--

1200
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,680
PROFESSOR: For now, what
we'll mean right now

1201
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,255
is that a small change
in this parameter

1202
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,940
leads to no change
in x equilibrium.

1203
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,675
Now, for any real example,
what we'll typically mean

1204
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:46,860
is 's going to be some sort
of sensitivity analysis.

1205
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,080
For example, where you'll say
oh, a 1% change in a parameter

1206
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,390
leads to a less than
1% change, for example.

1207
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:59,350
But in this case, there's going
to be no change, I'll tell you,

1208
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,890
just so we can get the
intuition clear here.

1209
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,090
All right, do you
need more time?

1210
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,270
Let's go ahead and vote.

1211
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:08,728
Remember, you can vote for more
than one thing if you like.

1212
01:03:08,728 --> 01:03:12,230
Ready, three, two, one.

1213
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:17,580
All right, some people are
using our more than one.

1214
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,300
And of course, I
can give you a hint.

1215
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,000
The reason that I'm letting
you vote more than once

1216
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,060
is because more than one thing
is going to be-- All right,

1217
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:30,380
so the majority of the group
has got this, but not everyone.

1218
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,020
So let's discuss.

1219
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,229
Can somebody give an explanation
for why both alpha and beta are

1220
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,020
going to work here?

1221
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,310
AUDIENCE: So the
equilibrium is basically

1222
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,734
when degradation
involves production.

1223
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,400
PROFESSOR: I want to
make sure I'm okay.

1224
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,160
The equilibrium is when
the production rate is

1225
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,730
equal to the degradation rate.

1226
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,230
So this is a very
important thing

1227
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,010
to make sure we're on top of.

1228
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,075
And in this case, we have
very sharp-- this production.

1229
01:03:57,075 --> 01:03:57,950
So then what happens?

1230
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,116
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE]
is the intersection of--

1231
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:02,170
PROFESSOR: Right,
so in this case,

1232
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,086
what is the equilibrium
concentration?

1233
01:04:04,086 --> 01:04:06,030
AUDIENCE: K.

1234
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:13,900
PROFESSOR: It's equal to K.
Now, I strongly encourage you,

1235
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,196
whenever possible,
to draw things out.

1236
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,570
Because this is a problem that
when you have the drawing.

1237
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,944
It's reasonable to do.

1238
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:21,360
And if you don't
have the drawing,

1239
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,440
you're going to get yourself
tied up into weird knots.

1240
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,140
And indeed, we can see
that if we change alpha,

1241
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,090
what happens in this spot?

1242
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:35,110
Right, it changes the slope.

1243
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,140
And you can see that
if we change the slope

1244
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,920
by small amounts, we
get no change where

1245
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,170
this crossing point is.

1246
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,532
And even for a real
system, if it came around,

1247
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:45,990
you'd see that it's
going to end up

1248
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,230
being a less than proportional
change in the equilibrium.

1249
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:53,480
And what about what about beta?

1250
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,020
That just raises
and lowers this.

1251
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,640
And again, that doesn't
change the equilibrium.

1252
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,110
Of course, if we changed K,
then we get a 1 to 1 change.

1253
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:07,030
So a 10% change in K leads to
a 10% change in the equilibrium

1254
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,984
concentration of x.

1255
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:11,940

1256
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,920
So this is the sense in which
the equilibrium concentration

1257
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,744
in negative autoregulation is
robust to changes in both--

1258
01:05:20,744 --> 01:05:22,660
in the book, they say
oh, the production rate,

1259
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,118
but it's actually
also in principle

1260
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:27,230
the degradation rate
over some range.

1261
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:30,390
And this could be
useful, because there

1262
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,840
are lots of things that are
going to affect the production

1263
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,360
rate of a protein, and
also the degradation rate,

1264
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,730
for that matter.

1265
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,750
The division rate,
it changes it.

1266
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,100
Whereas it may be
that K is subjected

1267
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,740
to less severe
changes, because that's

1268
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,610
determined by, for
example, in the kinetics

1269
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,930
of binding of this
protein to this promoter.

1270
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:56,020
And that is perhaps
less subject to changes.

1271
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:59,450
It can still change
depending upon the pH

1272
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:03,440
and so forth of the
interior of the cell.

1273
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,080
But at least it's probably
not subject to the big changes

1274
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,210
that alpha and beta are going
to be a good experience.

1275
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,370
So the argument that Uri makes
for why it is we see so much

1276
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:19,460
negative autoregulation in
the cell is because it both

1277
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:24,200
increases the rate that the
cell can respond to changes,

1278
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,340
in the on direction, at
least, but also that it makes

1279
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,420
the concentration of protein
more robust to changes

1280
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,260
in several of the parameters
that govern the equilibrium .

1281
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,030
Concentration And
once again, you

1282
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:41,140
could argue about which one
of these is more important,

1283
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,262
but I think they're both likely
playing a significant role

1284
01:06:44,262 --> 01:06:45,053
in different cases.

1285
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:50,860

1286
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:54,150
I'm going to want to move on,
but I will tell you that only

1287
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:58,560
over some range of these
-- alpha, beta, K--

1288
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,340
will this thing be robust.

1289
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,100
So for example, if
this comes up too high,

1290
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,350
we're going to lose this
phenomenon of robustness.

1291
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:13,940
So I expect you to be able
to tell me in some later date

1292
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:17,880
the conditions in which
that might happen.

1293
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,516
And I'm available for
the next half hour

1294
01:07:20,516 --> 01:07:22,890
after class, so if you do not
know what I'm talking about

1295
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,801
right there, please
hang out with me after,

1296
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:27,730
and I'll tell you the solution
to that question on the exam.

1297
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,260
OK?

1298
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:28,760
All right.

1299
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,620

1300
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,870
But I do want to talk about
positive autoregulation,

1301
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:38,710
because this is another
interesting beast.

1302
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:41,660
So if negative autoregulation
has those nice properties,

1303
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,000
then you can imagine that
positive autoregulation

1304
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,855
will have some drawbacks
in the same kind of ways.

1305
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,470

1306
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:54,351
But it leads to some other very
interesting, just qualitative

1307
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:54,850
features.

1308
01:07:54,850 --> 01:08:03,100

1309
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,100
Positive autoregulation.

1310
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:09,600

1311
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:15,440
So we have some x that
is activating itself.

1312
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,140
And often we think
about cases where

1313
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,109
it's activating
its own expression

1314
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:21,880
in a cooperative fashion.

1315
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,840
In particular, we
might assume that x

1316
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,520
dot is equal to, for
example, some beta 0

1317
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,600
plus some beta one of
some cooperative thing

1318
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:40,149
here where N might be 2 3 4
and then again minus alpha x.

1319
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,470
Right?

1320
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,080
Now, if you just
look at this, you

1321
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,010
might think oh, I don't know
what this is going to do

1322
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:45,551
and so forth.

1323
01:08:45,551 --> 01:08:47,430
But you've got to
draw things out.

1324
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,810
Once you draw it, then
you'll see that it's

1325
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,861
pretty straightforward.

1326
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,319
So again, this is the production
and the degradation rates.

1327
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:03,710

1328
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,790
So that's production.

1329
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,130
And degradation, for example,
might look like this.

1330
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,660

1331
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,350
So this is the production.

1332
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,359
This is the degradation.

1333
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,550
So that's the alpha x term.

1334
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:21,450

1335
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,399
One question would be,
how many fixed points

1336
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,720
does this system have?

1337
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,590

1338
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:35,020
So a fixed point means that
if you started right there,

1339
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:38,580
and in the absence of any noise,
you would stay right there.

1340
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,467
So it's clearly both stable
and unstable at these points.

1341
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:57,818

1342
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:58,568
Can you read that?

1343
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:02,060

1344
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,000
I'll give you 15
seconds to count them.

1345
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:18,060

1346
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:22,000
Ready, three, two, one.

1347
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,880

1348
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,190
All right, it seems like we
have pretty good agreement.

1349
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,160
There are indeed 3 fixed points.

1350
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:37,670
Once again, the fixed point
is where these curves cross.

1351
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:44,560
So we have one right here,
one here, and one here,

1352
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,170
Now, how many are stable?

1353
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,660
We're going to do this verbally.

1354
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,360
Ready, three, two, one.

1355
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:52,860
AUDIENCE: 2.

1356
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:53,445
PROFESSOR: 2.

1357
01:10:53,445 --> 01:10:54,320
Let's try that again.

1358
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,113
Ready, three, two, one.

1359
01:10:56,113 --> 01:10:56,612
AUDIENCE: 2.

1360
01:10:56,612 --> 01:10:57,153
PROFESSOR: 2.

1361
01:10:57,153 --> 01:11:01,940
Yeah, you get so used to the
card, it's hard to speak.

1362
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:05,580
So they're the ones on the
ends of the stable ones.

1363
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,754
And you see here that
around this point,

1364
01:11:08,754 --> 01:11:11,420
the production rate over here is
more than the degradation rate.

1365
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,580
That means that if you
leave that fixed point,

1366
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,560
you're going to get pushed away.

1367
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,290
So it's very nice to draw
these little arrows here

1368
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:19,600
to make one happy.

1369
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,520

1370
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,200
So this thing here is stable,
unstable, and again stable.

1371
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,150

1372
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,030
Now, the reason we
call this bistability

1373
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:38,350
is because there are
2 stable fixed points.

1374
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:43,600
This is important
because this phenomenon

1375
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:51,830
is the basic dynamical
system's origin of memory.

1376
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:57,330
Now it's, not obvious how
memory comes from this.

1377
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:01,380
So memory is a generalist idea
that the g-network or the cell

1378
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:06,836
can retain a memory
of its past state.

1379
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:08,460
And we're going to
see examples of this

1380
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,840
over the next few weeks.

1381
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,585
But just to be clear,
if, for example, we

1382
01:12:13,585 --> 01:12:17,100
imagine a situation
where the alpha changes.

1383
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,220
And it could be division
rate, for example,

1384
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,700
high-food, low-food
environments.

1385
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:29,520
What we do is we can
plot-- Often, you can plot,

1386
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,194
for example, the
equilibrium, but that's

1387
01:12:31,194 --> 01:12:32,110
a little bit trickier.

1388
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,776
So I'm just going to
plot the production

1389
01:12:33,776 --> 01:12:39,820
rate as a function of alpha.

1390
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:43,280

1391
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,010
Now, the question is,
if we change alpha,

1392
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,089
what's going to happen?

1393
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:51,880
Now, for a fixed alpha,
you can see already

1394
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,963
that there are two different
production rates that

1395
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:56,010
are stable in this case.

1396
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:59,060
But what happens if
we increase alpha?

1397
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,440
So we increase the growth
rate so it goes like this.

1398
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,890
Can that change the
number of fixed points?

1399
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:10,700
And indeed, what we can see is
that as this line gets steeper

1400
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,280
here, eventually you only
have a single fixed point,

1401
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,100
and it's stable.

1402
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,475
And that's known
as a bifurcation

1403
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:19,860
of the dynamics of the system.

1404
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:24,540
So this is for large alpha, you
end up-- And just to be clear,

1405
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,250
this is beta 0 down here.

1406
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:30,820
And then up here is the beta 1.

1407
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:35,050
So what we do is we
know that beta 0 is

1408
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,840
where we get for large alpha.

1409
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,900
Now, for small
alpha, do we end up

1410
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,460
getting another-- We
get another bifurcation.

1411
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,370
So actually, there's only
again one stable point

1412
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:52,679
up here at small alpha.

1413
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,220
And what we're going
to get is what's

1414
01:13:54,220 --> 01:14:00,740
known as a full
bifurcation where

1415
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,780
solid lines denote stable
points, stable fixed points.

1416
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:08,360
Dashed lines represent
unstable fixed points.

1417
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,806
So stable, and the
dash is unstable.

1418
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:19,480

1419
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,930
There are some regions
of alpha conditions

1420
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,540
where the system is bistable.

1421
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:27,170
But then outside of that,
it's just monostable.

1422
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,710
Can somebody explain
why this thing--

1423
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,960
why I might make the argument
that this thing displays

1424
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,460
memory?

1425
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,520

1426
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,730
Well, one of those two is
fine, but any new people

1427
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:43,245
want to explain my
thought process?

1428
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,060

1429
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,726
No.

1430
01:14:46,726 --> 01:14:47,600
All right, maybe you.

1431
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,840
AUDIENCE: All right,
well depending on

1432
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,318
whether we had high
degradation or low degradation

1433
01:14:53,318 --> 01:14:57,340
rates in the past, we'll be on
the lower or the upper range

1434
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,520
of that if we return to normal.

1435
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,520
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1436
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,603
So the argument here is
that-- let's say that this

1437
01:15:02,603 --> 01:15:05,740
is some normal condition.

1438
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,020
This is where you are
right now, for example.

1439
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,510
Now, depending upon whether
you're sitting here or here,

1440
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:13,400
that's perhaps giving
some information

1441
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,030
about the past
state of the cell.

1442
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:19,060
Because if you were here, that
means oh, maybe in the past

1443
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,340
you were out at high degradation
rates, whereas if you're here,

1444
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,410
maybe were at low.

1445
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:26,400
In particular, you
could reset things.

1446
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,430
If you start here, then you
can reset this memory module

1447
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:32,846
by coming over here.

1448
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:34,470
Once you get to this
point here, that's

1449
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,290
the bifurcation dynamics,
the full bifurcation.

1450
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:41,800
Then you come up here, and
now you'll retain this state.

1451
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,560
In principle, until
you get over here.

1452
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,893
Of course, there could be
stochastic switching dynamics.

1453
01:15:45,893 --> 01:15:48,760
We're going to talk a lot
about that in the coming weeks.

1454
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,120
But at least in the
limit of a low rates

1455
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,270
of stochastic
switching, then this

1456
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:56,280
represents some sort of
memory module, the simplest

1457
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,210
version of it.

1458
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:01,240
I'd say that in the cell, most
examples of such memory modules

1459
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,520
involve not just
positive feedback of one

1460
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,120
protein activating itself,
although this happens,

1461
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,120
but often through a whole
network, where the one

1462
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,430
protein activates another,
activates another,

1463
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:10,420
and then you come back.

1464
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:14,010
Or it could be
repressing, repressing.

1465
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:18,220
2 0's, is a po-- two
negatives is a positive.

1466
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,540
Just like two lefts is a right.

1467
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,386

1468
01:16:22,386 --> 01:16:23,760
Right, so are
there any questions

1469
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,940
about the sense in
which this thing can

1470
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:29,551
serve as a basic memory module?

1471
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,925
And this is maybe not the most
interesting example of it,

1472
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,850
because alpha is such
a global parameter.

1473
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,900
But you can also
get similar dynamics

1474
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,350
as a function of, for
example, the galactose

1475
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:43,270
in the concentration of
some sugar in your media.

1476
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,564
So given that different small
molecules such as food sources

1477
01:16:47,564 --> 01:16:49,230
can act as inputs
into these g-networks,

1478
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,180
you can also get these
sorts of dynamics

1479
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,630
as a function of what
you might call really

1480
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:59,540
some simple, external molecule,
which is nice, because that

1481
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,976
means that you can have
memory modules that are really

1482
01:17:02,976 --> 01:17:04,975
independent of all the
other memory modules that

1483
01:17:04,975 --> 01:17:06,550
are going on in your cell.

1484
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:09,790
Whereas if you had a vary alpha,
then this changes everything.

1485
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,730
Whereas if it's just a
concentration of some sugar

1486
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,610
outside, then you
can imagine that that

1487
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:17,620
could be very useful to retain
a memory of what the cell has

1488
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,620
encountered in the past.

1489
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:25,720

1490
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,220
So today, what we've
been able to do

1491
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:31,720
is analyze something about
a possible evolutionary

1492
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,825
explanation for
why autoregulation

1493
01:17:33,825 --> 01:17:36,770
is as commonly observed as is.

1494
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,430
So negative
autoregulation is the one

1495
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:41,160
that's observed perhaps
most frequently.

1496
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,190
And that, I think, has
some very clear purposes.

1497
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,620
And this idea of the
concentration being robust

1498
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:51,020
to other biochemical parameters
I think is a big idea.

1499
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,543
We're going to see
this idea of robustness

1500
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,440
crop up multiple times over
the course of this semester.

1501
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,890
And I think that it's nice
to think about robustness

1502
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:01,340
in this case, because
it's perhaps the simplest

1503
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,660
example of how robustness
as an approach can

1504
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:07,349
be useful as a way of
thinking about a problem.

1505
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,390
We're later going to be
thinking about robustness

1506
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:12,780
in the context of
perfect adaptation

1507
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,557
in chemotaxis, where
bacteria try to find food.

1508
01:18:16,557 --> 01:18:18,390
And there, I think
everything's more subtle,

1509
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,470
because already the base
phenomenon that is robust

1510
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,740
is a form of robustness.

1511
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,450
And so it kind of
gets you mixed up.

1512
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,310
So I think that it's good
to be very clear about what

1513
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,477
robustness means
here, so that we

1514
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:32,060
can use that to think
about robustness

1515
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,700
in other biological functions.

1516
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,520
With that, have a good weekend.

1517
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,536
Good luck on the problem set,
and I'll see you on Tuesday.

1518
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:40,036
