10
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:22,470
PROFESSOR: Today
what we want to do

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,750
is use the two papers that
you read as kind of a backdrop

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,660
to try to think something
about the regulation of genes

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,730
in response to
changing environments.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,130
So there's the
Mitchell paper that

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,880
is talking about this idea
of anticipatory regulation,

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,530
whereby if the
environmental changes have

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,330
some typical pattern, then maybe
the cells can take advantage

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,480
of that and start preparing
for environment number two

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,000
when the cell sees
environment number one.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,470
But in other cases, it may be
that the environment fluctuates

21
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,370
in ways that are really
fundamentally unpredictable.

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,900
In that case, you can't use the
sort of anticipatory regulation

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,130
strategy, but instead,
there may be a way

24
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,459
that you can just
stochastically switch

25
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,440
between the different strategies
and implement what's known

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,140
as a bet hedging strategy.

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,490
And this is modeled
largely on the work

28
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,910
that you just read about in
the Kussell paper, Science

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,870
maybe May 2005.

30
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,560
I do want to stress,
however, that if you observe

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,550
phenotypic heterogeneity
in a clonal population,

32
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,040
that does not necessarily mean
that the cell or the population

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,970
is implementing one of these
bet hedging strategies.

34
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,600
In particular, I would
argue rather strongly

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,256
that there are other
possible evolutionary drivers

36
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:40,630
for such phenotypic
heterogeneity

37
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,730
in the population.

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,390
First of all, just
because you see

39
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,740
some phenomena does not mean
it is necessarily selected for.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,830
So it's possible that it's a
side effect of something else.

41
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,960
However, if you're looking
for an evolutionary kind

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,857
of explanation for
something like this,

43
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,190
bet hedging is not the only one.

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,030
In particular,
we'll talk about two

45
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,780
other possible
explanations, and they both

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,870
have to do with kind
of game dynamics

47
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,900
that we might illuminate
or talk about.

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,101
But I guess our game
theory talk was--

49
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,100
that was a week and a
half ago, almost two weeks

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,170
ago now-- so maybe you've
forgotten all the game

51
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,550
theory that we discussed.

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,400
But in particular,
it could be that

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,733
the phenotypic heterogeneity
might be the implementation

54
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,390
of a mixed strategy.

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,640
Or possibly it could be
an example of some sort

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,630
of altruistic self-sacrifice.

57
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,980
And we'll try to explain
the theory behind each

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,790
of these three things as well
as possible biological examples

59
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,920
of each of the three.

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,240
In this case, we may
think about bet hedging

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,770
as maybe an explanation
for antibiotic persistence,

62
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,150
this idea that cells can
switch into these slow-growing

63
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,525
persister states
in which they're

64
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,680
resistant to antibiotics
and other stresses.

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,900
Mixed strategies
could be-- well,

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,570
we're going to argue
it could be implemented

67
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,080
in the context of mixed
sugar environments.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,680
And altruistic
self-sacrifice may

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,954
be the explanation behind
colicin production in bacteria,

70
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:04,620
so it's a toxin.

71
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,060

72
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,230
So I want to start by
thinking about this thing

73
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,030
about adaptive prediction
of environmental changes

74
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,050
by Mitchell.

75
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,810
I think this is a
very interesting paper

76
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,700
in a number of different ways.

77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,600
One is, I think that it's
sort of a big idea that

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,550
can be explored in these
simple experiments.

79
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,990
I think that it's an
exceptionally clear paper

80
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,870
in some ways, and
that they really say,

81
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,300
oh, we're going to propose
that this strategy should

82
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,450
be characterized by
these three things.

83
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,550
And then they go and they try
to show you the three things.

84
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,270
The figures, I think,
are also very nice,

85
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,010
in the sense that
in many of the cases

86
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,450
you could have shown the data
just in the context of a table,

87
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,850
where you said, oh, for
each of these strains, this

88
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,570
is the up regulation or so.

89
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,570
But if you had done that,
it would've been much,

90
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,990
I think, less compelling,
even though of course it's

91
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,410
the same data.

92
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,780
So I think this is a neat
paper, in my opinion,

93
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,370
both from the standpoint of the
ideas that are being explored,

94
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,527
but also because it
highlights some of the things

95
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,110
that you should be
thinking about when

96
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,450
you're writing your own papers.

97
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,170
You want to try to make the
ideas as clear as possible.

98
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,050
You want to lay
the groundwork so

99
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,730
that what you're
about to show is

100
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,396
going to be-- the
reader's going to feel

101
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,190
is a really important thing.

102
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,330
And then you want to take
nice advantage of color

103
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,290
and some legends that are there.

104
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,280
So we'll kind of talk about
all these issues as we go.

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
But before we get
started, can somebody--

106
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,470
there's a very real sense
that in this field of decision

107
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,000
making and systems biology that
a lot of this research program

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,830
is kind of driven by
following classic ideas

109
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,370
from other fields.

110
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,940
And what would be the
corresponding classic idea

111
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,312
this paper is exploring?

112
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:00,270
AUDIENCE: Conditioning.

113
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,269
PROFESSOR: Conditioning.

114
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,440
Right.

115
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,062
And whose name do we associate
with conditioning typically?

116
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:05,770
AUDIENCE: Pavlov.

117
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,420
PROFESSOR: Pavlov.

118
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:06,920
All right.

119
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,810
So I have not ever
read these studies.

120
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,660
Pavlovian conditioning.

121
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,229

122
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,520
And I think that this is
just-- it's good to highlight.

123
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,061
This is something
that you might have

124
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:21,220
learned in your high
school psychology class.

125
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,500
And it's, again, a big idea,
but it's not the kind of thing--

126
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,970
we've all heard--
well, we're going

127
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,261
to talk about this in a moment.

128
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,980
Many of us, I think,
have heard of this.

129
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,146
But this is an example
of how you take something

130
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,770
that you learned in
high school and you

131
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,475
make it useful to your daily
life, or pseudo daily life.

132
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:42,100
Because I think you'll see that
there are many kind of examples

133
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,280
of this throughout
this literature,

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,630
where someone takes an
idea that is, in some ways,

135
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,880
you open up a random textbook
in introductory psychology,

136
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,420
and you can just
march through and try

137
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,370
to see to what degree the
ideas that were developed

138
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,830
in the context of
humans or animals,

139
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,710
to what degree might they be
relevant in the context of cell

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,960
decision making?

141
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,470
Can somebody just say what is
this Pavlovian conditioning

142
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:06,970
idea?

143
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,560

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,860
Did you guys take high
school psychology?

145
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,190
I'm sure somebody did.

146
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,790
No.

147
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,290
All right.

148
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,710
Well, incidentally,
I recommend everybody

149
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,760
should take a solid
introductory psychology

150
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,400
class if you have not done so.

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,420
We offer a class 900.

152
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,700
I'm sure that it's
good and interesting.

153
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,335
Yes.

154
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:35,467
AUDIENCE: So there's two
different events or stimuli,

155
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:40,377
and in Pavlovian conditioning
you give one and then

156
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,330
always give the
other one following.

157
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,370
PROFESSOR: That's right.

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,930
So there's some sense
that what we might call--

159
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,080
there are two
events of some sort.

160
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,970
One is following the other one,
so it's A and then followed

161
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,150
by B. And people have done many
different examples of this,

162
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,680
but what's the one
that we typically--

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,289
what's the classic
experiment that Pavlov did?

164
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,330
AUDIENCE: You ring a bell,
and then you get food.

165
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

166
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,150
Right.

167
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:20,860
So you ring a bell and then
you give-- and this is dogs,

168
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,940
at least in the
version I remember.

169
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,117
So you have some dogs,
you do this thing

170
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,450
where you ring the bell and
then you give them the food.

171
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,048
And what's the response
that you're supposed to get?

172
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:33,920
AUDIENCE: Drooling.

173
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,878
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

174
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:37,080
So the dog is supposed
to start salivating.

175
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,580
OK.

176
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,460
So you might think
your experiments

177
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,190
are gross, but-- right.

178
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,670
So ring a bell, and the idea
is that you can train the dog

179
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,365
to start salivating in response
to the bell, rather than,

180
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,990
of course, if you
give the food they're

181
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,270
going to start salivating.

182
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,270
But here you can train the
dog to start salivating

183
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,340
in response to the food.

184
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,055
So now, with training,
this results in salivation.

185
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:01,835

186
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,870
And did Pavlov show there was
a fitness benefit associated

187
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,430
with the salivation?

188
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,480
Not that I'm not I'm aware of.

189
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,110
But this is the classic
story that we learned

190
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,670
in introductory psychology.

191
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,610
And the question is, can
we apply a similar idea

192
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,340
in the case of microbial
decision making?

193
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,230

194
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,330
Now was this-- can
somebody say what

195
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,510
they think was the
author's contribution

196
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,580
to the literature in the
sense of-- via a vis this?

197
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,450
How much of what-- well, we
can be maybe more concrete.

198
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,239
In the case of E. coli,
what was known-- or maybe

199
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,030
we should describe the
experiment once more

200
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,930
and then try to figure out
what they did that was new new.

201
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,714
At least can somebody kind
of summarize the basic idea

202
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:57,255
with E. coli?

203
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,950

204
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,324
AUDIENCE: We know that they have
a certain metabolic life cycle

205
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:08,710
and that they exist in
different environments.

206
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,486
PROFESSOR: OK.

207
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,610
So that E. coli existent
in different environments.

208
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,401
And what environments
are you referring to?

209
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,185
AUDIENCE: Gut and outside.

210
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:16,310
PROFESSOR: Gut and outside.

211
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,490
So if this is
true-- then what is

212
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,620
going to be your next
statement based on this?

213
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,103
AUDIENCE: Well, going
through mammalian guts

214
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,967
there's always a certain
sequence of events.

215
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,221
At the beginning, there's
some acid, and then

216
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,095
less acid and more food,
and stuff like that.

217
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:35,730

218
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,570
PROFESSOR: RIght.

219
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,340
So in the context of E.
coli, there's this idea

220
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,160
that part of the
life cycle of E. coli

221
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,005
and some other of
these microbes is

222
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,850
to live inside the
gut of mammals.

223
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,625
And we're going to
focus in particular

224
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,490
on this aspect, the part of the
life cycle that is in the gut.

225
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,380
So let's just imagine, so E.
coli in gut or entering gut,

226
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,220
going through the gut,
they might encounter

227
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,700
some sort of typical
environmental cues,

228
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,740
or maybe orders of
environmental exposure.

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,680
And actually, even
before this paper,

230
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,530
there was another paper that was
published by Saeed Tavazoie--

231
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,340
hard name to pronouce-- who
was at Princeton at the time.

232
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,950
So he had published a
Science paper just the year

233
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,620
before-- well, couple years
before-- demonstrating

234
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,565
a related phenomenon.

235
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:33,480

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,880
What was it that this other
paper had demonstrated?

237
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,960
Does anybody remember
from the introduction?

238
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,090
So it wasn't the experiment
that these guys did.

239
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,650
But in the
introduction they spent

240
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,153
half of a paragraph describing
this other experiment.

241
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:50,590

242
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,280
Another kind of
environmental cue

243
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,150
that E. coli get when
they enter the gut.

244
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,352
So what's-- yeah.

245
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:02,280
AUDIENCE: Isn't there a
temperature increase and oxygen

246
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,960
decrease?

247
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,200
PROFESSOR: Temperature
increase and oxygen decrease.

248
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:14,420
So temperature goes up
and oxygen goes down.

249
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,190
And this makes sense.

250
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,910
The inside of our
bodies typically

251
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,160
warmer than outside our body.

252
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,500
Also, it's a relatively
anaerobic environment

253
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,510
inside the gut as compared
to the ready availability

254
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,180
of oxygen outside.

255
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,630
So what is it that this
other paper then showed?

256
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:47,399

257
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:47,899
Yes.

258
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,542
AUDIENCE: So I think
they were trying

259
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,843
to show a symmetric
response [INAUDIBLE].

260
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:55,294

261
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,759
If adaptation in one
situation occurred,

262
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,689
then-- if it received
one stimulus,

263
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,425
it would adapt to both.

264
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,050
PROFESSOR: Yes.

265
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,550
OK.

266
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,110
And the word adapt, we always
have to be very careful,

267
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,110
because it could mean two
very different things.

268
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,360
And in some cases, it might
be that both-- possibly it

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,750
might be true, but when
you say that it receives

270
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,910
one stimuluss-- so
this we might call S1,

271
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,820
and this is S2-- so these
are stimuli that the cell

272
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,356
senses-- are you saying
that it might sense one,

273
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,480
and then it adapts to both.

274
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,800
When you say adapt,
are you referring

275
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,890
to evolutionary adaptation
or something else?

276
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,884
AUDIENCE: I'm referring
to a single cell

277
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,550
implementing the
appropriate metabolic--

278
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,910
PROFESSOR: That sort of
cell level adaptation.

279
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,080
The sort of default thing
is you might, say, well,

280
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,240
if you get the stimuli one
and increase the temperature,

281
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,240
you should implement the program
one or the response one that

282
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,220
corresponds to some set
of genes that are required

283
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,670
to grow in high temperature.

284
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,450
Now similarly with stimulus
2-- well, we'll say this is R2.

285
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,460
So these could, in principal,
have different gene network

286
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,330
responses to these two
environmental changes.

287
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,280
But what they found is that
actually, if you take E. coli

288
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,240
and you expose it to
increase in temperature,

289
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,869
then not only does it
activate the genes required

290
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,785
to handle high temperature,
but also activates

291
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:29,902
the genes required handle
low oxygen, and vice versa.

292
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:32,740

293
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,290
Now there's a question, though.

294
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,470
If you see this, it
could just be the case

295
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,240
that you've mislabeled
what really is R1, R2.

296
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,670
Maybe it's just a single
R, single response

297
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,910
that allows the population
to adapt to both

298
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,737
of those environmental changes.

299
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,320
Does anybody remember
what the authors

300
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,640
did to show that that was
maybe not what was going on?

301
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:10,247

302
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,580
You can look at your sheet
of paper while I--I just want

303
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,740
to write down the reference
in case anybody wants to look

304
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,500
at this more.

305
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:31,750
This is Tagkopoulos,
Science 2008.

306
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,590
What would you do if
you wanted to show

307
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,780
that this was a real
regulatory strategy,

308
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,960
this so-called symmetric
anticipatory regulation?

309
00:14:40,960 --> 00:15:04,040

310
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,540
Yes.

311
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,294
AUDIENCE: Would it
be you could measure

312
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,855
genes' pressure
somehow, and then you

313
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,662
could get the function of each

314
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,370
PROFESSOR: Right.

315
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,035
So you could expose
to this stimulus,

316
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:17,660
measure gene expression, expose
to this stimulus, measures gene

317
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,550
expression, and try
to figure out, maybe,

318
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,850
based on the difference
which genes were more

319
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,770
or less-- but the
argument was somehow

320
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,510
that in response to stimulus
1, there were some genes that

321
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,059
were really unnecessary.

322
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,600
So I guess you could
go and you could

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,930
do knockouts of each
of these 100 genes,

324
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,030
and then try to
measure the effects.

325
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,655
And that would be
a nice direct--

326
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:45,030
and it's related to something
that they did in this paper

327
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,940
with the yeast.

328
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,370
They went and looked at the
gene expression profiles.

329
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,990

330
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,230
What they did in
this paper by Saeed

331
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,350
was that they took
the E. coli that

332
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,490
displayed this, what they're
arguing is a symmetric--

333
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,470
and based on some
previous studies, I think,

334
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,800
saying that, oh, this had
been annotated to be good

335
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,470
for temperature but not
for oxygen and vice versa.

336
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,680
So there were already hints
that this kind of made sense.

337
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,720
But what they did is they
evolved the populations

338
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,770
in just one of
these environments

339
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,478
and showed that they
could decouple them.

340
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:18,710

341
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,500
So that's at least
making you feel

342
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,740
that it's a little bit--
that maybe this was not

343
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,692
due to just some sense that
it's the same genes that

344
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,150
are required for protection
against these two environments,

345
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:36,450
but rather that because they
had evolved in this environment

346
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,660
where, when they see an
increase in temperature,

347
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,324
they often see a
decrease in oxygen.

348
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,824
AUDIENCE: So when
you say decoupled,

349
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:48,050
you mean you evolve them in
high-temperature environments?

350
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,319
PROFESSOR: That's right.

351
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,235
AUDIENCE: You expose
them to decreased oxygen,

352
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:52,050
and then they die?

353
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,133
PROFESSOR: No, no, no, no.

354
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,420
So just, they showed that
if you evolve the population

355
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,370
so that it receives this
stimulus without this stimulus,

356
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,850
then it removes
this arrow, that it

357
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,500
stops activating these genes.

358
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
And then I think
they also did look

359
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,815
at the functional consequences.

360
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:10,190
But the first
order thing is just

361
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,079
that they saw that
they could remove

362
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,140
one of these arrows, which is
related to something that they

363
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,930
do here as well.

364
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,810
Now I think that
it's worth thinking

365
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,690
about the question of
whether this study, published

366
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,980
in Science in 2008,
do you think that it's

367
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,530
a complete scoop of the
paper that you just read,

368
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:43,880
which is Amir Mitchell's paper
published in Nature in 2009?

369
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,570
No.

370
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,070
OK.

371
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,819
And on one level you
say, well, they still

372
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:51,250
got it published in Nature, so
therefore it was not a scoop.

373
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:58,260
But I can tell you that
Amir was very worried,

374
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,260
because he had been working
on this paper for many years.

375
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,020
And they really studied
both E. coli and yeasts.

376
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,590
It was a major thing.

377
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,850
And then this paper
came out, and I'm

378
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,260
sure that he was despondent.

379
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,874
And there will be
times where you

380
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,540
feel despondent as a
result of something

381
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,990
like this coming out, because it
really is a very similar idea.

382
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,850
The E. coli stuff
is very similar,

383
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,200
because it's same organism--
the idea is, in the gut.

384
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,024
So in what ways do you think
that their paper is different,

385
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,440
and also, what
strategies did they

386
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,370
follow in order to
differentiate their paper?

387
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,540

388
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,296
Yeah.

389
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,810
AUDIENCE: Maybe
potentially trying

390
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,205
to find differing regulation
mechanisms, so they said, well,

391
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,065
there's a symmetric
regulation mechanism

392
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:49,565
that someone talked
about last year,

393
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,990
and we've got the
asymmetric one.

394
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

395
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,620
And I think that
this is-- of course,

396
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,860
we cannot replay history.

397
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,410
But I think that they do a
very nice thing in figure one

398
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,370
of laying the groundwork
to make it very clear

399
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,150
that their work is
different from Saeed's work.

400
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,740
And the thing is that if
this had not been published,

401
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,840
they maybe would have framed
their work differently.

402
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,870
They might not have
had this difference

403
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,940
between a symmetrical
anticipatory regulation

404
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,310
and the asymmetrical.

405
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,850
But by laying
things out that way,

406
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,200
it clarifies that, oh yeah,
these are different things.

407
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,580
And they're going
to explore this one,

408
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,240
whereas Saeed's
group had explored

409
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,672
a rather different mechanism.

410
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,880
But then, of course, depending
on how you look at it,

411
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,379
they're either more
or less similar.

412
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:41,140
But I think that they do a
very nice job of kind of right

413
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,154
at the beginning setting
out how their work is

414
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,070
going to be different.

415
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,170

416
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,720
So they explained that there's
the simple direct sensing

417
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
mechanisms.

418
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,370
You'd say that you just
have different stimuli that

419
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,080
lead to different responses.

420
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,354
That's fine.

421
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:04,270
They also have the
stochastic switching, which

422
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,561
we're going to talk about more.

423
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:10,620

424
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,540
The idea here is
that even though we

425
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,582
might be getting different
stimuli at some rates,

426
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,790
we would still switch into
these different responses.

427
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,240

428
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,000
And we'll talk about various
reasons that this might happen.

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,541
Incidentally, these
things don't have

430
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,070
to happen at the same rates.

431
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,570
So it could be that stimulus
one it primarily does R1,

432
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,250
whereas stimulus 2 primarily
does R2, for example.

433
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,985
If you'd like, these arrows
could have different strengths.

434
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:40,800

435
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,380
But then what they do is they
point out that there really

436
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,572
are-- well, this symmetric
anticipatory regulation,

437
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:50,030
where it's crossed,
maybe I'll just

438
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,238
write out the asymmetric one.

439
00:20:51,238 --> 00:21:04,960

440
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,670
Can somebody say
why it is that we

441
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,350
might want to do the
asymmetrical as compared

442
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,645
to the symmetrical?

443
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:30,425

444
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,900
Yes.

445
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,860
AUDIENCE: If both of the stimuli
are appearing at the same time,

446
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,335
then you might want to have
a symmetric anticipatory

447
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:40,322
regulation?

448
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:41,030
PROFESSOR: Great.

449
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,770
So the important thin
is here that this

450
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,055
is, because it's at the same
time, the two stimuli kind

451
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:53,230
of come together, or very
similar times, whereas this,

452
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,330
if there's a clear
temporal order.

453
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,020

454
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,030
But you could think about
this in some other way

455
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,090
as well, maybe.

456
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,850
Can somebody--

457
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:10,261

458
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,760
AUDIENCE: It's along
the same lines,

459
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,070
but there's a cost to
having S2 also performing.

460
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,195
Then if you ever use that--

461
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:21,162

462
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:21,870
PROFESSOR: Right.

463
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,450
So depending on
the costs, it could

464
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,540
change what's sort of
optimal, perhaps, right?

465
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,700
And I think it's also
perhaps worth just saying

466
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,520
that it may also depend
upon how frequent

467
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
these different environmental
perturbations are,

468
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,630
because you can also
imagine situations

469
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,470
where it's very common that
the temperature goes up,

470
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,180
but it's very rare
that oxygen goes down.

471
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,431
But there could be a sense
in which this is, basically,

472
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,930
based on the logic
I just said, this

473
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,806
would be then less
predictive of this

474
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,930
than this would be of this.

475
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,450
Do you guys see what I'm saying?

476
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,908
Because it could be the case
that any time that oxygen goes

477
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,810
down, then you really know that
that means that you're entering

478
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,740
somebody's gut and you
also better activate this,

479
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,340
whereas it could also be
the case that if you sit out

480
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,190
in the sun, you get
hot, it doesn't mean

481
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,481
that oxygen's going to go down.

482
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:13,750
So it could be that there
is more or less information,

483
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,380
or that each of the stimuli
have more or less information

484
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,590
about another stimuli.

485
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,950
So even if there's
no temporal order,

486
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,900
it could be the case
that something like that

487
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,010
could lead to a situation
where this might be optimal.

488
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,164

489
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:33,625
AUDIENCE: So it seems
people try to make

490
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:37,485
formal statements about
information in this context,

491
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:40,275
just like they did in the
context of stochastic theory.

492
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:43,540

493
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,990
PROFESSOR: So
there's some of it.

494
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,280
I haven't seen anything
that's quite as

495
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,740
clear and formal as what Edo
Kussell did in that Science

496
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,070
paper you guys just read.

497
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,250
But for example,
Amir did do a paper,

498
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,600
he wrote a PNAS paper basically
laying out this model that's

499
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,520
sort of sketched at the end
of this paper a little bit

500
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,830
in more detail in
terms of explaining,

501
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,310
depending on the probability
that something occurs

502
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,020
and the time, so
kind of exploring

503
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,680
this a bit more,
but not as formal

504
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,645
in terms of information as--

505
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,270
AUDIENCE: So it's
not quite clear to me

506
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,680
why you would have a symmetric
anticipatory regulation

507
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,130
comparing direct sensing.

508
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,070
If you have direct sensing,
you can do the same thing.

509
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,610
PROFESSOR: That's right.

510
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,360
I think it's true.

511
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,730
But it could also be that
because these things are

512
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,940
both fluctuating and
they are measured

513
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,922
with some noise and
the environment,

514
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,130
there could be a sense that--
because you can imagine

515
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,880
a world in which
these two things are

516
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,210
both uncertain predictors of
whether you're in the gut.

517
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,690
But if they both
go, then that really

518
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,620
means something, in which
case then it would make sense

519
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,120
to really look at both of them
and activate both more strongly

520
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,390
as a result of seeing both.

521
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,186
AUDIENCE: But it
could also make you

522
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,800
more susceptible to
trigger a response that you

523
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,760
don't necessarily want.

524
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,890
PROFESSOR: That's true.

525
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,420
But if you say, oh, well
this happens at a low rate

526
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,920
and this happens
at a low rate, then

527
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,720
the probability that both of
them happen at the same time

528
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,850
would be very small.

529
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,120
So your rate of false
positive, in that sense,

530
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,760
would be-- you can really reduce
the rate of false positives

531
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,790
by integrating both
pieces of information.

532
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:38,380

533
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,980
And this paper, just
to remind ourselves,

534
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
this paper is
primarily exploring

535
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,280
the idea of asymmetrical
anticipatory regulation.

536
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,340
And their argument
is because there's

537
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,420
a typical temporal order to
how E. Coli that are ingested

538
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,640
encounter different sugar.

539
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,560
And the claim in the paper is
that bacteria will typically

540
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,060
see what before what?

541
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,365

542
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,826
AUDIENCE: Lactose
before maltose.

543
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:13,617
PROFESSOR: Correct.

544
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:18,660
So the claim is that in the gut,
the bacteria will see lactose

545
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,170
before they see maltose.

546
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,880
Now in order to evolve this
asymmetrical anticipatory

547
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,812
regulation, does it have to
be that you kind of always

548
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:32,270
see lactose before
you see maltose?

549
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:39,730

550
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,450
So let's imagine that only 10%
of the time that the bacteria

551
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,550
see lactose-- or sorry,
only 10% of the time

552
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,540
that the bacteria encounter
maltose that they actually saw

553
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,420
lactose before.

554
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,420

555
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,010
Since 10% is much less
than 1, should that totally

556
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,070
scotch this whole mechanism?

557
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,570
No.

558
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,880
And can you say why not?

559
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,750
AUDIENCE: Every time they
see lactose they see maltose.

560
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
PROFESSOR: That's right.

561
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,910
In some ways, that's
not the right way

562
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,840
to think about it, but in
terms of a cost-benefit type

563
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,400
argument, why is it that
maybe it's OK in principle

564
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,220
that maltose is frequently
observed without lactose?

565
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,891

566
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:28,326
AUDIENCE: There's no difference
between the two strains

567
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,032
if you see maltose that way.

568
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:30,740
PROFESSOR: Right.

569
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,440
And I think this is a kind of
an interesting, important point,

570
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,180
which is that if you imagine a
competition between the strain

571
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,360
that just does, we can imagine,
direct sensing versus we'll

572
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,440
call that AAR.

573
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,090
So direct sensing versus
asymmetrical anticipatory

574
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,180
regulation.

575
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,110
Now if you imagine the
situation where you encounter

576
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,350
maltose without encountering
lactose, then these two

577
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,516
strategies behave
essentially identically,

578
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,140
because they both
just see the maltose,

579
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,650
they're both surprised.

580
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,080
They both activate the mall
genes, everything's fine.

581
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,800

582
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,540
However, it's in
this other direction

583
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,873
that you have to think about it.

584
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:16,420
So the real question is,
when you encounter lactose,

585
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,230
you want to think about, well,
what fraction of the time

586
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,220
and how long a delay is there
before you encounter maltose?

587
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,270
Because if it's the case that
you encounter lactose a lot,

588
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,140
and only infrequently do
you then come on to maltose,

589
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,090
that's going to be a
problem for evolving this

590
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,190
into asymmetrical
anticipatory regulation,

591
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,900
or it would not necessarily
be optimal to do so,

592
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,190
because in that case you're
going to be activating

593
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,150
all those mall genes in
advance, and frequently it

594
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,920
won't be useful.

595
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,690

596
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,730
And this is relevant, perhaps,
just because what fraction

597
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,112
of the time do you think
that E. coli going to the gut

598
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,070
will encounter lactose?

599
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:11,460

600
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,840
We should be able to make a
reasonable estimate of this,

601
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,620
is my claim.

602
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:22,330

603
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:22,830
All right.

604
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,360
Where does lactose come from?

605
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,160
Lactose comes from milk.

606
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:36,720

607
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,800
Which animals drink milk?

608
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,660

609
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,690
Well, right, OK.

610
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,110
So we're thinking about mammals.

611
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,142
Just take a random
mammal of your choice.

612
00:29:46,142 --> 00:29:47,600
You might want to
not choose humans

613
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,020
just because we're a little
bit atypical in this regard,

614
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,970
although even there
I think the numbers

615
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,220
end up being kind of the same.

616
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:03,680
But imagine a dog or a bear
or your favorite mammal.

617
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,890
Which of them are drinking milk?

618
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,740
The young, right?

619
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,239
OK.

620
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:12,190
So there's some period of one's
life where you drink milk,

621
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,000
and then as an adult
you typically don't.

622
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,290
I guess all I'm
saying is that if you

623
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,960
imagine the bacteria entering
into a mammalian gut,

624
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,350
it might be 20%.

625
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't know what,
but it's basically

626
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,730
proportional to the years.

627
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,080
The kids, they may
eat more dirty things.

628
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,890
So you have to wait or whatever.

629
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,970
The point is that they're
going to encounter lactose

630
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,650
if they enter the gut of
a baby or young child,

631
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,260
whereas if you enter an adult,
then you won't see lactose,

632
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,650
and you'll just maybe then
directly see the maltose.

633
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,670
But there's no real
cost associated

634
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,910
with missing that
signal vis a vis

635
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,160
the so-called direct strategy.

636
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,900

637
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,715
I think that they do lay out
some other kind of conditions

638
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,560
that they think would be
reasonable to demonstrate

639
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,830
if you want to do the
asymmetrical anticipatory

640
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,370
regulation.

641
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:22,010
And once again, I think
that this is both very clear

642
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,440
and also just lays
the groundwork

643
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,310
for the reader in the
sense that they tell you

644
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,460
what they would need to show in
order for you to be convinced.

645
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,960
And then they go and
they do those things.

646
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,330
Now in principle,
you could argue

647
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,700
about one or the other things.

648
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,570
But I think they
do such a nice job

649
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,400
of being clear about what would
be needed that you don't even

650
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,291
think to object about any of it.

651
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,790
And of course they're not going
to bring up the three things

652
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,940
that they would
need to demonstrate

653
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,315
unless they actually were able
to demonstrate those three

654
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:49,470
things.

655
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,720
So the three things
that they claim

656
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,810
is that for this to have been an
evolved trait that pre-exposure

657
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:08,180
to S1 increases the
fitness under S2 or R2--

658
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,660
I guess in this
case-- that's right.

659
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,840
So getting S1 helps you in S2.

660
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,504
So seeing lactose
helps you in maltose.

661
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:18,920
Indeed they're
going to show that.

662
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,940

663
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,780
Second, that there's
some cost associated

664
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,170
with up regulating
that, in this case

665
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,990
up regulating the mall genes.

666
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,600
And third, there's this
idea of specificity.

667
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,110
Now the claim is
that it's really

668
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,710
S1 that is activating
this R2 response,

669
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,010
and that various other S's, in
this case other sugar sources,

670
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,790
maybe should not pre-activate.

671
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:56,260

672
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,120
Now in figure 1,
they basically are

673
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,950
exploring the difference
between this arrow and this one.

674
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,710
So if you expose
the cells to maltose

675
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,370
you activate the mall
genes at a high level.

676
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,030
Is it required that
exposure to lactose up

677
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:20,570
regulates the mall genes to
the same level as maltose?

678
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,440
No.

679
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,273
Was it at the same
level as maltose?

680
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:23,772
No.

681
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:26,570

682
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,750
But the idea is it up
regulates it some, as compared

683
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,340
to other carbon sources.

684
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,760

685
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:50,520
Now they also made a comment
about whether this arrow,

686
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,010
the so-called
anticipatory regulation,

687
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,010
whether it was specific
to their E. coli strain,

688
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,195
and their claim was
that it was or was not?

689
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:03,349

690
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,640
Would it be good for it to
be specific to their strain,

691
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,140
or bad?

692
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,620

693
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,580
Probably bad, although the
fact that-- but then they

694
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,290
say, oh, it's not
specific to our strain.

695
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,150
And then they cite another
paper, which-- and this

696
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,650
is, again, a nice
way of phrasing

697
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,082
it because they're adding
strength to their paper

698
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:27,290
because they're saying, oh,
it's not just our strain.

699
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,030
It's in other strains as well.

700
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,567
So you read that sentence
and say yes, that's good.

701
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:33,150
Of course you could
read that sentence

702
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,290
and say, oh, but somebody
else already showed this?

703
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,440
But this is, again--
and I don't have

704
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,650
any real complaint about that,
because I think what they've

705
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,020
done is they've really
brought a set of measurements

706
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,110
together in one
conceptual framework

707
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,260
that I think is
rather compelling.

708
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,969
Now of course, you
can always argue about

709
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,780
whether each of
these examples really

710
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,460
did evolve for this purpose
or not and so forth.

711
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,190
But just because
somebody else had

712
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,810
seen that there was some
cross-regulation of the mall

713
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,091
genes in response to lactose.

714
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,840
Doesn't mean that this
paper is worthless.

715
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,860

716
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,460
But it is interesting to note
that somebody else had already

717
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:14,960
seen this.

718
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,110

719
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,610
Moreover, in figure
one they compare

720
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:27,310
this asymmetrical anticipatory
regulation for their wild type

721
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,182
strain as compared
to another strain.

722
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:30,640
And what other
strain did they use?

723
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,630

724
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,580
Yes.

725
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,680
AUDIENCE: You didn't
expose the cells to maltose

726
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,962
after the lactose [INAUDIBLE].

727
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:45,670
PROFESSOR: Right.

728
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,550
They evolved the cells in
lactose for 500 generations.

729
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,345

730
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:55,470
And then what did they see?

731
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,915

732
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:01,910
AUDIENCE: The arrow.

733
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

734
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,890
When they saw was that
evolution-- and this

735
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:13,110
is in lactose-- removed that.

736
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,910

737
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,485
Now 500 generations,
how long do you think

738
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:20,610
this is going to take them?

739
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:27,820

740
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,900
AUDIENCE: A few months.

741
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
PROFESSOR: A few months.

742
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,090

743
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,900
Have you guys ever
heard of any other paper

744
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:43,540
where they evolved E. coli in
lactose for 500 generations

745
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,590
in your extensive
reading of the literature

746
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,425
that you've engaged
in over this semester?

747
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:53,231

748
00:36:53,231 --> 00:36:54,710
AUDIENCE: The
cost-benefit paper.

749
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,450
PROFESSOR: The
cost-benefit paper.

750
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,230
So it's fascinating to note
that this sentence, they said,

751
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,520
"We have examined
laboratory-evolved strains

752
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,180
of E. coli.

753
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,780
Did they say that they
did the evolution?

754
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,680
No, they didn't.

755
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,440
And indeed, if you follow
Citation 14 over here,

756
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,760
you can say, oh, right.

757
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,790
So it's another paper
by Uri and company.

758
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,430
So I don't know if it was
the exact same experiment,

759
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,940
but the idea is
that-- so I think

760
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,070
what they did is, they
took the strains that

761
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,440
were evolved for another
purpose, and that's fine.

762
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,790
If somebody else already
did the daily dilutions

763
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,330
for three months that is the
exact same that you were going

764
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,640
to do, then you
might as well just

765
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,310
analyze their evolved
strains, right?

766
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,530
There's nothing that says you
have to go and repeat the work.

767
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,150
You would get the same
thing, maybe, presumably.

768
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,750
So this is just
worth highlighting.

769
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,330
But it makes the
paper much stronger

770
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,960
that they were able to do that.

771
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,760
So it's good to keep in mind
that in some cases, what you

772
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,120
need to do to make your
point has already been done

773
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,920
or has already been
evolved and so forth.

774
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,560
So now what we
have is a situation

775
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,950
where somebody else,
maybe, has already seen

776
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,610
that lactose activates maltose.

777
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,730
Somebody else already did
this evolution on lactose.

778
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,340
They didn't yet show that
this regulation was removed.

779
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
So that was something
that these guys had to do,

780
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,150
and indeed, it looks
like it's removed.

781
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,820
But once again, I think there's
a sense that they're really

782
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,570
looking at this problem
from kind of a new, maybe

783
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,219
comprehensive way
that allows them

784
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:33,635
to see the connections
between all

785
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:34,801
these different experiments.

786
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,830
And then they are
doing new measurements.

787
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,590
But the measurements themselves
are perhaps relatively simple,

788
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,160
but the trick is knowing
what measurements

789
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,690
you need to do in
order to say something

790
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,689
that's very interesting.

791
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:52,610

792
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,060
So in figure three, what
they went and they did is

793
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,310
they asked about this question
of whether there really

794
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,260
is a fitness benefit
associated with it.

795
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,120
Now I think this is
another case where

796
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,450
you could have made this
figure in the form of a table,

797
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,074
and it just would not
be very compelling.

798
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:13,740
So you'd look at it and you just
wouldn't be very excited by it,

799
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,440
whereas in this case, they
have the figure, which

800
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,550
are these fitness advantages
associated with whether you

801
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,290
take the strains, you first
expose them to lactose and then

802
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,360
go to maltose, or
you go from maltose

803
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,810
to lactose, or in this case GAL
to maltose, sucrose to maltose.

804
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,500
What they showed was it was
a selective benefit there,

805
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,870
that the cells really only gain
the benefit of pre-exposure

806
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,680
to a sugar if it's lactose.

807
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,690
And they show that for
the evolved strain,

808
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,730
not only does it no
longer have that arrow

809
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,280
in the sense of the response,
but it also no longer

810
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,100
has the benefit.

811
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,850
It's good to do both
of those measurements

812
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,583
because it's possible you
might have missed something.

813
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,083
Yeah.

814
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,265
AUDIENCE: So but like, it's for
one protocol going from lactose

815
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,090
to maltose.

816
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

817
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,800

818
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,940
Yep.

819
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,532
And this is the
nature of science,

820
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,490
or in particular this
kind of science, I think,

821
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,150
that you can
collect data that is

822
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,380
consistent with
this interpretation,

823
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,020
but it does not at all prove
that this is not gut, either.

824
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,550

825
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,260
And so you could have
imagined experiments

826
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,230
where you maybe mixed
two strains that

827
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,270
follow this direct
versus the AAR,

828
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,230
and you mix them together
50-50 in the gut.

829
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,310
And then you go and you
do sequencing later.

830
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,690
And actually, people do
such kinds of experiments,

831
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,820
and in some cases, amazingly,
sometimes something

832
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,562
comes out the other end
that is interesting.

833
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:53,520
I couldn't help myself.

834
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,228
Sorry about that.

835
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:57,210

836
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,040
So yes.

837
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,270
One other point on this
paper, or this figure,

838
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,390
that they even color
code the data points.

839
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,880
So they have their main
thing in this black,

840
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,190
but then the other ones
are red, yellow, blue.

841
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:18,480
it's telling us that this
thing is directional.

842
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,160
It's S1, S2, S2, S1,
specificity, extinction.

843
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,790
So they are even
kind of telling us

844
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,190
what each of those
data points mean.

845
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,570
And you might say, oh,
that's kind of overkill.

846
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,660
But given that it's just
so important that you're

847
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,051
keeping track of why we're
doing each of these measurements

848
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:39,300
and what it's supposed to
tell us about the big story,

849
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,810
I think that it's really just
wonderful to be reminded,

850
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:51,410
OK, what is this controlling
for, or what not.

851
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,648
Yes.

852
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:53,680
AUDIENCE: I like the colors
too, but they don't stand out

853
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,888
very well in black and white.

854
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,240

855
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,040
PROFESSOR: Yes, well, OK.

856
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,930
So we can lead entire
discussions about both

857
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,050
how to write a paper
and how to read a paper.

858
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,410
How to read a paper is
that you should just

859
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,960
get a color printer, OK?

860
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,460
So that's the advice.

861
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,890
In terms of how
to write a paper,

862
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,790
I would say, though,
that it's always

863
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,420
good-- you should take
advantage of colors,

864
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,740
but you should choose the
color scheme/scale such

865
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,557
that it is legible or
compelling in both color

866
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:25,390
and black and white.

867
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,440
And actually there's
a very nice set

868
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,339
of articles written by Wong,
who's a graphic artist that

869
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,130
works at the Broad.

870
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,174
He wrote maybe 15 different kind
of one- or two-page articles

871
00:42:39,174 --> 00:42:40,590
for Nature Methods,
basically just

872
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,714
about how to write figures.

873
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:43,800
And he talks about these
different color scales.

874
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,990
You know, there's-- what
do the words mean when

875
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,670
there's brightness?

876
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,844
Color, hue, saturation.

877
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:54,010
I can't remember what all
these things mean anymore.

878
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,700
But that's why you
should read the articles.

879
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,456
And it's fascinating
stuff, actually.

880
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:06,820

881
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,120
So this is the basic argument
they made in this paper,

882
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,830
that because E. coli are exposed
to a typical order of carbon

883
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,510
sources in the mammalian
gut, that that's

884
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,375
the possible explanation for
why this thing evolved that they

885
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,750
can measure
experimentally, which

886
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,890
is that when, these E.
coli, they see lactose,

887
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,000
they start activating the
mall genes but not vice versa.

888
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,720
Now, like always,
you can't prove

889
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,280
that this is what's going on.

890
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,740
I think very interesting
set of ideas.

891
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,640
Some of the people that
study gut microbes just

892
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,390
think that it's implausible that
this would actually work out

893
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,920
in the sense that the fitness
cost benefits, et cetera,

894
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,704
would be relevant.

895
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:51,620
Do we know that the time
scales even work out?

896
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,200
I don't know how-- so
there are a bunch of things

897
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,350
that you could worry about.

898
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,320
And I would say I don't
know enough about what

899
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,580
goes on in the gut to
actually have an educated

900
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,680
opinion on that point.

901
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,200
But I think it's a very kind of
clear exposition of the ideas.

902
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,676
Yeah.

903
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:11,644
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a sense for what

904
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:19,024
fraction of E. coli bacteria
are in the gut of animals?

905
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,008
Do you see what I mean?

906
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:22,000
Because it's just a
very small fraction.

907
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

908
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,930
Yeah, and I guess--
so I myself definitely

909
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,470
do not know what fraction
of E.coli are in the gut as

910
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,712
compared to in the
soil or in the--

911
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,170
it's not that E. coli are the
dominant bacteria in our gut,

912
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:34,730
either.

913
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,250
It's just that they do
enter the gut at some rate.

914
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,670
And then the question is,
if we knew the answer,

915
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,852
I don't even know if it
would tell us-- I mean,

916
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:46,810
it gives some guidance.

917
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,470
But there's also a
question of where

918
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,220
is it that cells are
actually dividing,

919
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,610
because it could be the
case that the life cycle is

920
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,370
that they go in the
gut, and that's where

921
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,540
they're dividing and happy.

922
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,560
And then they end up
in some soil somewhere,

923
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,000
and they're in some stationary
phase, and maybe most of them

924
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,870
are dying at some small rate.

925
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,690
Eventually some of
them get uptaken again

926
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,231
and then they divide,
divide, divide.

927
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,730
So it could be the cases that
only 0.1% of all E. coli,

928
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:11,980
or 01% of the time.

929
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,520
It could be a very small
amount of time or something,

930
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,269
and they're in the
gut, but it could still

931
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:20,610
be the dominant
event in their lives.

932
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,667
So I just don't know.

933
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:25,010

934
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:29,190
I think I'm maybe going to skip
the second half of the talk,

935
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,480
or second half of the
paper, where they discuss

936
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,930
this idea of the typical
order of events in which yeast

937
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,380
in the context of
fermentation and making wine

938
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,231
might encounter or experience
different environmental

939
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:44,730
assaults.

940
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,854
And it's a similar kind of
idea of cross-protection

941
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:49,405
against different assaults.

942
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:52,070
But in some ways,
this is really sort

943
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,210
of two mini-papers
that tie together

944
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,480
in this general thing of
anticipatory regulation.

945
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,540
Are there any questions
about this before we move on?

946
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,977

947
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:09,963
Yes.

948
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:13,003
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about when

949
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,206
the baby males grow up.

950
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,372
Do they need this mechanism?

951
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:19,330

952
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,207
Do E. coli?

953
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,790
PROFESSOR: OK.

954
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,310
So your question is whether
E. coli in the gut of adults

955
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,280
have this.

956
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:37,720
I don't know, but my feeling is
that these things are probably

957
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,220
fairly transient in the
sense that you probably

958
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,180
don't have-- well, certainly,
from the standpoint of entering

959
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,460
the gut, the bacteria
don't have any choice

960
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,620
about whose gut they enter.

961
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,870
So it probably is going
to be the case that they

962
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,560
have to have a
basic strategy that

963
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,850
is going to work across
both adults and the kids,

964
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,890
although it's true that
the gut communities in kids

965
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,550
are different from adults.

966
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,037
But it's hard to know
what to make of that.

967
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:06,975
Yeah.

968
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:12,300
AUDIENCE: So here they
decouple the two responses.

969
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,644
Are there any examples of
researchers coupling them,

970
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:17,550
like Pavlov's?

971
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

972
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,258
That's a good question.

973
00:47:20,258 --> 00:47:22,216
I know that I've heard
people talking about it,

974
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:24,300
but I can't point to
a specific example

975
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,883
of where it's been convincing.

976
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:29,758
That doesn't mean it's
not out there, though.

977
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:33,620

978
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,686
It's a very important,
interesting question.

979
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:43,284

980
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:45,200
So what we want to now
is kind of switch gears

981
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,984
a little bit and switch
to this topic of-- it's

982
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:51,400
going to be kind of partly
about phenotypic heterogeneity,

983
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,660
but partly again about
fluctuating environments.

984
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,010
And the way that those
two topics are related

985
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,910
is via bet hedging,
but I just want

986
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:04,470
to highlight that bet
hedging is a way of using

987
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,220
phenotypic heterogeneity in
order to survive fluctuating

988
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,024
environments, whereas it's
not the only explanation

989
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:13,440
for this phenotypic
heterogeneity.

990
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:24,040

991
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:34,940
So yeah, I think maybe
we'll-- so first of all,

992
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,750
on the topic of
phenotypic heterogeneity,

993
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,260
when we say that we are often
referring to the fact that even

994
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,430
clonal populations can be
remarkably heterogeneous

995
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:48,710
in a given environment.

996
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,480
So we'll say phenotypic
heterogeneity

997
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,397
in clonal populations,
because of course,

998
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:57,730
if there's a lot of genetic
diversity in the population,

999
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,934
then it's not, perhaps,
a surprise there would

1000
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,100
be phenotypic heterogeneity.

1001
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,050

1002
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,740
What we're going to do
is go through these three

1003
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,840
different possible explanations
and discuss, maybe,

1004
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,990
canonical biological
examples of each.

1005
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:21,920

1006
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,700
And the examples that
we're going to give-- well,

1007
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,760
the classic example is in the
context of seed germination.

1008
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:37,870

1009
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,520
But more recently
there's this question

1010
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,470
of the persister cells, or
the persistence phenotype.

1011
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:52,760

1012
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,280
Now in both of these
cases, it's really

1013
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,810
a way in which a
clonal population can

1014
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,700
send a small population
of either seeds or cells

1015
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,780
into a protected state that's
protected against some assault.

1016
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,640
So seed germination,
this is a case

1017
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,250
where the seed, if
it doesn't germinate,

1018
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,646
it's protected against draughts.

1019
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:18,146
Draught.

1020
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:23,366

1021
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,865
And this one, maybe,
is antibiotics.

1022
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:30,182

1023
00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:31,640
What I want to do
is just make sure

1024
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,140
that we understand the
seed germination idea.

1025
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,010
And so this is, from the
standpoint of ecology,

1026
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,580
these ideas came out
in the '70s, at least.

1027
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,520
So what we can imagine is a
situation where you are some,

1028
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,550
maybe, desert annual.

1029
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,120

1030
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,310
And so you send out these seeds.

1031
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,030
Now most of the time,
you get enough rain,

1032
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,240
the seeds are fine.

1033
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,430
They can germinate, sprout
the little seedlings,

1034
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,370
and they'll be able
to grow up just fine.

1035
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,830
But at some rate there
might be a severe drought

1036
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,600
that would kill all the cells
that actually germinated.

1037
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,130
So the question is, what
might be the optimal strategy?

1038
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,730
So for example,
let's just imagine

1039
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:27,840
that we live in a world
in which 75% of the time

1040
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:34,450
there's rain, 25% of the
time there's no rain.

1041
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,230

1042
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:44,233
Now if you germinate--
so a particular seed,

1043
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:49,070
if it germinates,
it pops out-- then

1044
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:55,810
it will expect to send two
seeds to the following year,

1045
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,380
whereas as it germinates
and there's no rain,

1046
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:05,380
then it only has a 10%
probability of surviving,

1047
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,560
or that it could on
average send 1/10 of a seed

1048
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,910
to the next generation.

1049
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,760
Now of course, you
don't have to germinate.

1050
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,230
If you don't germinate,
then what happens

1051
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:28,770
is that you just send one
seed to the next year.

1052
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,190
If you'd like, you can
include some probability

1053
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,411
that the seed doesn't survive,
but for simplicity, we

1054
00:52:34,411 --> 00:52:34,910
can do that.

1055
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,090

1056
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,840
So the idea is that you don't
know whether it's going to rain

1057
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,890
or not.

1058
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,540
But what you can do is you
can either germinate or not

1059
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,760
germinate.

1060
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,206
And then this tells us
how many seeds make it

1061
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:50,510
to the following year.

1062
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,530
Do you understand the framework?

1063
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:00,580
So the question is, which
one of these strategies

1064
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,970
has a higher long
term growth rate

1065
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,257
in terms of the number
of seeds that you

1066
00:53:07,257 --> 00:53:08,215
have in the population?

1067
00:53:08,215 --> 00:53:21,220

1068
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,950
I'm going to give
you 30 seconds just

1069
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,450
to kind of think
about this, play

1070
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,130
with the numbers a little bit.

1071
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,570
And the question
is, should you just

1072
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,054
have a strategy where you
germinate or don't germinate?

1073
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:33,470
And then what we're
going to find,

1074
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,950
maybe, is that the
optimal strategy is

1075
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,464
to do this probabilistically.

1076
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:40,380
But it's useful to just
play with such numbers

1077
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,088
for a little bit.

1078
00:53:41,088 --> 00:54:11,840

1079
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,590
The physics office,
unfortunately,

1080
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,310
is trying to steal our cards
from us, so we don't have them.

1081
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,010
But what we're
going to instead do

1082
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,939
is, if you think you
want to germinate

1083
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:21,980
you raise your left hand.

1084
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,229
If you don't want to germinate,
raise your right hand.

1085
00:54:24,229 --> 00:54:24,770
OK.

1086
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:29,460
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

1087
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,710
So we have a fair
distribution of-- it really

1088
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,049
is kind of 50-50.

1089
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:35,840
That's interesting.

1090
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,106
All right, let's go ahead and--
yeah, let's spend a minute.

1091
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:43,730
Turn to your neighbor and try to
convince them that it's either

1092
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,854
better to germinate or not.

1093
00:54:44,854 --> 00:55:23,316
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

1094
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:28,601
You can start with 100 of one,
100 of another, and then just--

1095
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:30,559
AUDIENCE: Start with 100
and then you just go--

PROFESSOR: Let's
say 10 to the 4.

1098
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,885
So we're trying to
not think about this--

1099
00:55:44,885 --> 00:56:06,067
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

1100
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,900
So there's another
question about short term

1101
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,810
versus long term.

1102
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,310
And we're actually trying
to not worry about that.

1103
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,917
So you can think about large
populations, so it's really--

after one year.

1105
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,220
You will maximize
your expected value.

1106
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,340
PROFESSOR: That's why
I said the long term

1107
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,381
growth of the population.

1108
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:25,795
So if we just compare--
so why don't we reconvene.

1109
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,920
Various people have been
talking about the question

1110
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,564
of how many seeds
you're starting with,

1111
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:32,230
what the population
size is, because you

1112
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,560
have to worry about extinction.

1113
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,518
And that's another kind
of interesting question

1114
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,752
of short term versus long
term payouts of fitness.

1115
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:39,460
That's actually not
the effect that we're

1116
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,930
trying to get at right now.

1117
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,190
So we can even think about
this in the limit of just

1118
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,420
large population sizes.

1119
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,650
And we want to compare
the two strategies.

1120
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,599
And for any strategy
you choose, including

1121
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,140
the probabilistic
strategies, there's

1122
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,120
going to be a long term
growth rate of the population.

1123
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,882
So it will grow or shrink
exponentially over time.

1124
00:56:56,882 --> 00:56:58,340
And what you want
to do is you want

1125
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,506
to find the strategy, in
the context of bet hedging,

1126
00:57:00,506 --> 00:57:03,831
you want to find the strategy
that maximizes this long term

1127
00:57:03,831 --> 00:57:05,080
growth rate of the population.

1128
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,020
And this is essentially what
Edo talks about in his paper,

1129
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,190
but in a more mathematical,
general-- because he's talking

1130
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:16,510
about n different
phenotypes and environments

1131
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,790
and arbitrary switching rates.

1132
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,090
And it's beautiful and general
and he makes nice connections

1133
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,650
to information theory.

1134
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,330
But it's possible to read
that paper and then not

1135
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,090
actually understand
what bet hedging,

1136
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,840
or what any of these
things are, quite.

1137
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,050
So it's good to take
the simple thing,

1138
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,780
and then it's also good to
know that somebody like Edo

1139
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,196
has thought about
this very deeply

1140
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:38,280
and figured out all
these beautiful things.

1141
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,280
And I know that paper was hard,
so don't-- but it's really like

1142
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,580
a two-page paper if
you look at the text.

1143
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,410
So it shouldn't take
too much time just

1144
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,201
to get a sense of what
he's thinking about.

1145
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:52,570
But then it's good, also, to be
concrete in a simple situation.

1146
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,052
So what we want to know is
that, over the long term--

1147
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:56,760
then what you can do
is you can just say,

1148
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,290
well, the ratios of rain,
no rain over the long term

1149
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:06,100
will be 3 to 1, because
it's over a long term.

1150
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,960
It doesn't matter what
order they come in

1151
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,316
because over the long run
it's all going to average out.

1152
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:12,190
We're assuming we're a
large population size,

1153
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,480
so we don't have to worry
about stochastic extinction.

1154
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,980
The question is,
since we don't have

1155
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,040
to worry about
stochastic extinction,

1156
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,450
then can we just
say that we just

1157
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,660
calculate, for example,
the mean weighted

1158
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,120
by these fractions
of these numbers?

1159
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,710
And actually, the
subtle possible thing

1160
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,350
is that it's the geometric
mean that is relevant,

1161
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,480
not the normal mean.

1162
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,070

1163
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:41,340
And that's somehow tricky
when given these numbers.

1164
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:46,760
But it's sort of obvious if
you just switch this to a 0.

1165
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,364
Because if this is a
0, then is germinate

1166
00:58:49,364 --> 00:58:50,530
going to be a good strategy?

1167
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,050

1168
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,100
No, right?

1169
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,730
Because what that would mean
is that if everybody always

1170
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:01,770
germinates, it may be that
this number could be 1,000,

1171
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,560
and it's wonderful except
that if, at some low rate,

1172
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,260
there's no rain and this is a
0, then the population's dead.

1173
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,353
And you'll always
encounter that eventually.

1174
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:12,727
So that just
highlights that it's

1175
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:15,820
the geometric mean you
want to be focusing on.

1176
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,910
And in particular, we know that
on average, over the long term,

1177
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,160
there are going to be three
of these years for each

1178
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,820
of these years.

1179
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,710
So we can just
multiply the numbers.

1180
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:26,890
So it's really going to be
there's going to be three times

1181
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:33,770
where you double for each one
time that you divide by 10.

1182
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,480
What you see is that
over the long run,

1183
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:44,960
this population shrinks, whereas
in this case it's 1 times

1184
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,030
1 times 1 times 1.

1185
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,800

1186
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,350
So the long term
growth rate/shrinking

1187
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,880
rate of these populations
is that in the long run

1188
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,675
this population does
not change in size,

1189
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:59,540
whereas over the long run,
this population shrinks.

1190
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,790
AUDIENCE: So in the geometric
mean the expected change

1191
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,922
in the log population, which
is also the expected percentage

1192
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:05,963
change in the population.

1193
01:00:05,963 --> 01:00:06,546
Is that right?

1194
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:09,755

1195
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:10,380
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1196
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,730
So I think that if
you take the logs,

1197
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:12,730
it ends up being equivalent.

1198
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,605
But you have to make
sure you just do it all.

1199
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:18,850

1200
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,650
And I guess what I want to
highlight in this case is that,

1201
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,310
A, you have to be careful
of taking averages, but B,

1202
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,090
to get the intuition
behind the situations

1203
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,480
where bet hedging, I
think, is really valuable,

1204
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,550
it's situations where
this thing gets very small

1205
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,610
and this might
become rather large.

1206
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:39,810
So you can imagine
that this could be 200

1207
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,310
and this could be
10 to the minus 9.

1208
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:46,430

1209
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,790
Or if you'd like, you
could say that's 0.

1210
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,160
And it's clear that
if this is 0, then

1211
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,590
you can't germinate
all the time,

1212
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,256
because then the
population's definitely

1213
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:56,870
going to go extinct
over the long run.

1214
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,290
But this is also
a situation where

1215
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,290
there's real tension between
long term and short term

1216
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,840
situations if this
probability is very small.

1217
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,470
But it's in these
situations that it

1218
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,280
pays, in terms of the long run
growth rate of the population,

1219
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,366
to do this some
fraction of the time.

1220
01:01:16,366 --> 01:01:17,490
And it could be very small.

1221
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:21,960
It could be that only one
in 10 to the 4 of the cells

1222
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,920
enter this persister state that
is resistant to antibiotics.

1223
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,991
But it can maximize
the long term growth

1224
01:01:27,991 --> 01:01:28,949
rate of the population.

1225
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:33,530

1226
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,952
There are various
models that you

1227
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:38,410
can write down for either seed
germination or this or that.

1228
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:43,110
But the relevant thing is, for
example, in the persister case,

1229
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,760
it might be that the rate
of persister formation

1230
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,070
might only be one cell in
10 to the 5 or 10 to the 6.

1231
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,430
So a very small
sub-population of the cells

1232
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,760
are in this so-called
persister state.

1233
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,510
But those cells, they have
a couple of properties.

1234
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,280
One is that they
are dividing slowly.

1235
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,379
That means there really is a
cost to entering that persister

1236
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:04,170
state, but if it's only
one of 10 to the 5,

1237
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:07,370
that means that it's really
a rather small cost in terms

1238
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:10,490
of decreasing the growth
of the population.

1239
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,195
And those cells also could
be resistant to antibiotics.

1240
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:14,820
So you can select
for them in the sense

1241
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,278
that you add a
bunch of antibiotics

1242
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:21,360
and maybe only the persister
cells are left after 12 hours.

1243
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,580
But even though I say
you selected for them,

1244
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,350
it's not a true antibiotic
resistance kind of mutation,

1245
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,320
because if you take that
persister population,

1246
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,890
you let it grow
back up, what you

1247
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,949
find is that it is still
sensitive to the antibiotic.

1248
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:38,240
Now it's also possible that
at some low rate, maybe one

1249
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,150
in 10 to the 8, you evolve
resistance to an antibiotic.

1250
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:44,010
That's genetic resistance
that stays with you,

1251
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,950
whereas the persister
kind of resistance, this

1252
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,750
is something that is
a phenotypic switch.

1253
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,970
And when it grows
back up, it kind of

1254
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,490
reverts back to the
original phenotype,

1255
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,170
which is being sensitive
to the antibiotic.

1256
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,380
So that's the classic
way that you distinguish

1257
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:04,114
between genetic resistance
and this persister-based or

1258
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,030
phenotypic resistance.

1259
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,380
Yes.

1260
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,921
AUDIENCE: What would
be the mechanism

1261
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:08,140
of something like that?

1262
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,139
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1263
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:11,141
So people argue a fair
amount about this.

1264
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:12,640
And there's a thought
that there are

1265
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:19,330
these toxin, anti-toxin modules
in bacteria that are normally

1266
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,070
suppressed but can be
triggered, and then

1267
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,880
can lead to these
states entering,

1268
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,900
although this ends up kind of
a muddy debate/subject somehow.

1269
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,480
But the idea is that there's
something in the cell that

1270
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,290
is normally repressed,
but then at some rate

1271
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,304
activates and causes the
cell to-- and of course,

1272
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:41,970
you can always argue, OK, did it
evolve for this purpose or not?

1273
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,320
Because also, if
you're dividing slowly,

1274
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,170
then you're going to be
resistant to many things.

1275
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,580
But then there's also arguments
that there are somehow

1276
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,520
more specific
persister-type states

1277
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,810
against particular assaults
or particular antibiotics.

1278
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,485
So I think that there
are many subtleties

1279
01:03:56,485 --> 01:03:57,360
to this whole debate.

1280
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:07,850

1281
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:11,010
Any other questions about
this idea of bet hedging?

1282
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:15,150

1283
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:18,290
So I think that bet
hedging is indeed

1284
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:23,290
one possible way
in which evolution

1285
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,520
could select for phenotypic
heterogeneity in a population.

1286
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,620
So this is a population of seeds
that are all, in principle,

1287
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,480
identical.

1288
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,500
You put them out and
you plant them all

1289
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,320
and they see the
same environment.

1290
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,230
They don't all germinate.

1291
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,560
But it's not that all those
seeds that didn't germinate

1292
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,760
are dead, because actually,
the following year, they still

1293
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,206
go back and they can follow
some stochastic strategy.

1294
01:04:44,206 --> 01:04:46,080
So I just want to stress
that right now we're

1295
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,260
considering the two extremes,
but for bet hedging,

1296
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:54,117
you say probability germinate,
1 minus p, don't germinate.

1297
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:56,700
And those are, in general, going
to be some probability p that

1298
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,882
can be non-0 that
maximizes long term growth

1299
01:04:58,882 --> 01:04:59,840
rate of the population.

1300
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,100

1301
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,130
But I do want to talk about two
other possible explanations,

1302
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:12,442
which is this idea of mixed
strategies and altruism.

1303
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,900
Now mixed strategies,
in some ways,

1304
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,040
is an obvious one,
because we just

1305
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:21,170
got done talking about mixed
strategies in game theory,

1306
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:25,470
where there is this notion
that in a given game,

1307
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:29,990
sometimes this Nash equilibrium
was a pure strategy,

1308
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:31,510
or the evolutionary
stable state.

1309
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,880
But sometimes at the
equilibrium there

1310
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,671
was coexistence of
these two strategies,

1311
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:38,170
and that could be
either implemented

1312
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:43,369
by two different genotypes, or
by one genotype implementing

1313
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:44,035
both phenotypes.

1314
01:05:44,035 --> 01:05:47,250

1315
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,540
So this was the classic
game that people talk about

1316
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,580
in this area is
this hawk dove game.

1317
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,700
We talked about this just
a little bit in class.

1318
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,480
So this is a model
of animal conflict.

1319
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:11,880

1320
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,700
And the idea is the
animals can either

1321
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:19,350
be-- so the idea is that
there are two animals

1322
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,291
and they come across
some resource.

1323
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,040
And the resource could
be food or it could

1324
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,640
be a mate or something else.

1325
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,580
And the question is,
should those animals

1326
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,000
fight for the resource
or should they back down?

1327
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,090

1328
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,920
Now the assumption
in all this is

1329
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,840
that the hawk is the strategy
that fights and the dove

1330
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,690
is the strategy that backs down.

1331
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:43,050
Now the question
is, how do we assign

1332
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,830
some sort of costs and benefits
to these various strategies?

1333
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,550
Again, where this is
the situation where

1334
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,050
we take the two-player
game and then

1335
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,470
we'll kind of generalize
it to the population.

1336
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,250
Well, if two doves
encounter each other,

1337
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,250
then they don't need
to fight at all,

1338
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,340
and they just split the benefit.

1339
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,382
So there's some benefit
to the resource,

1340
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:02,590
and they each get half of it.

1341
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,600

1342
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,502
Now of course, if a
hawk meets a dove,

1343
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:13,680
the hawk actually does better,
because then the hawk gets

1344
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,220
the entire benefit, doesn't
have to pay the cost.

1345
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,670
So already we can see from
what I've said so far,

1346
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,150
is dove a Nash equilibrium?

1347
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,590
No, because you can already
see that if your opponent is

1348
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,340
a dove, it's better for you.

1349
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,298
If you start in the
situation where everybody's

1350
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,380
a dove, so everybody's
getting b over 2,

1351
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,480
then one individual
has the incentive

1352
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,570
to change strategies and
get the full benefit.

1353
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:44,370
That hawk never has to fight
anybody because they will all

1354
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,000
back down.

1355
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,740
Now of course this
dove that fought

1356
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:53,160
that hawk doesn't get
any of the resource,

1357
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,190
but also doesn't have to fight.

1358
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,020
However, question is, what
happens if two hawks meet?

1359
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,370
And that's a situation
where they really go at it.

1360
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:06,220
And what you might say is,
then, there's a 50-50 shot,

1361
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:10,720
that each individual has a 50%
chance of getting the benefit,

1362
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,222
but then also has
to pay this cost.

1363
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,680
And then you can
decide whether you

1364
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,840
want to have-- so I think
it's normally parameterized

1365
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,841
to b minus c over 2.

1366
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:23,090
The idea here is that you
have a 50% chance of getting

1367
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,870
the benefit, but you have a 50%
chance of getting beaten up.

1368
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,350
OK.

1369
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:29,359
Very simple model.

1370
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,090
Now the way that we
normally parameterize

1371
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:39,837
this is that-- let's say
that we want the hawk-- wait,

1372
01:08:39,837 --> 01:08:41,600
hold on a second.

1373
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,250
Under which circumstances
will the hawk strategy

1374
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,324
be a Nash equilibrium?

1375
01:08:46,324 --> 01:08:52,228

1376
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,720
AUDIENCE: If b is larger than c.

1377
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:53,990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1378
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,899
If b is larger than
c, then the hawk

1379
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:58,229
would be a Nash equilibrium,
which is actually what

1380
01:08:58,229 --> 01:08:59,460
we don't want in this game.

1381
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,540
So what we typically
assume is that the benefit

1382
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,720
is less than the cost.

1383
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,240
So in that sense, it's somehow
not worth fighting for.

1384
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,319
And that means that neither
strategy is a Nash equilibrium.

1385
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:20,747
So neither the hawk nor the
dove is a Nash equilibrium.

1386
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:24,880
And indeed you can calculate
what the Nash equilibrium is,

1387
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,350
and the Nash equilibrium is
to follow a mixed strategy

1388
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:34,990
with some probability p star
that is, I think, b over c.

1389
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:38,330

1390
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,847
So if there's a
bigger benefit, p star

1391
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:42,930
is the probability of
following the hawk strategy.

1392
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:53,859

1393
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:57,920
But as the costs grow, then this
Nash equilibrium probability

1394
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,750
decreases.

1395
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,390
So this is a case where
it's a mixed strategy that

1396
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,680
is this Nash equilibrium.

1397
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,060

1398
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,290
And so this is a
situation that displays

1399
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,644
what we call negative
frequency dependent selection.

1400
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:16,560
You can see that the
rare strategies do better

1401
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,164
than common strategies.

1402
01:10:18,164 --> 01:10:19,580
The key way to
think about this is

1403
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,630
that if you have a
population of doves,

1404
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,050
then a rare hawk does better.

1405
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,930
However, if you have
a population of hawks,

1406
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,150
then it's a rare dove
that does better.

1407
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,940
And it's that kind of negative
frequency of dependence

1408
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,540
that pushes the population
towards some equilibrium

1409
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,610
between the
phenotypes, or it could

1410
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,200
be equilibrium between genotypes
as well, because you could have

1411
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:47,100
pure strategists of a hawk and
a dove, so different genotypes

1412
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,760
that just are different.

1413
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,720
And the differences in
fitness will naturally

1414
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,260
lead to evolution to
an equilibrium hawk

1415
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,840
kind of frequency
in the population

1416
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,580
that is equal to this.

1417
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,860
So this tells us either about
the equilibrium frequency

1418
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,210
of the genotype of
hawk in the population.

1419
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,350
Or it could be that it's
a single genotype that

1420
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,105
implements these two strategies
with some frequency that

1421
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:10,810
is b over c.

1422
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:19,200

1423
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,232
So I'd say that this is a simple
idea from the context of game

1424
01:11:23,232 --> 01:11:25,190
theory, and the question
is, what circumstances

1425
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:28,315
might this actually arise
in kind of real populations.

1426
01:11:28,315 --> 01:11:32,215

1427
01:11:32,215 --> 01:11:33,590
Oh, before I say
anything else, I

1428
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,964
do want to stress
that all of you

1429
01:11:34,964 --> 01:11:37,670
have played mixed strategies
before, because in the Rock

1430
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,086
Paper Scissors game, which
we're going to be talking about

1431
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:45,580
more in the coming week or
so-- you guys all know this,

1432
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,820
that rock beats-- not paper--
but rock beats scissors,

1433
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,930
scissors beats paper,
paper beats rock--

1434
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:55,360
so the Nash equilibrium of that
game is to do 1/3 1/3, 1/3,

1435
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,360
because if everybody's
following that strategy,

1436
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,330
nobody has the incentive
to change strategies.

1437
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,300
Definition of the
Nash equilibrium.

1438
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:05,080
Is that the optimal strategy
against any opponent?

1439
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,330
No.

1440
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,100
And this is very
important to point out,

1441
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,870
because when you think
about these Nash equilibrium

1442
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:12,750
and everything in
abstract terms,

1443
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,640
it's easy to get
confused about--

1444
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,016
when we say that it's--
sometimes we say optimal,

1445
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:18,390
or it's the solution
to the game,

1446
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:20,830
that doesn't mean that it's
the best response to any given

1447
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:21,690
strategy.

1448
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,064
And you know that,
because if you

1449
01:12:23,064 --> 01:12:26,012
know that your little brother
is going to play rock, then

1450
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:27,720
you know-- well,
depending on whether you

1451
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,220
want to make him happy or not,
you decide what to do, right?

1452
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,970
So it's clear that this
1/3, 1/3, 1/3 thing

1453
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,197
is, it can be the solution
to the game of the Nash

1454
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:37,530
equilibrium without being the
best response to any given

1455
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,029
strategy.

1456
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:41,384

1457
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:43,300
So one of things that
we're doing in my group,

1458
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,370
actually, is we're arguing
that in the case of yeasts that

1459
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,720
are exposed to mixed
sugar environments--

1460
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,850
so yeast in environments that
contain a little bit of glucose

1461
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,415
and a little bit of galactose--
what we and actually

1462
01:12:56,415 --> 01:13:00,420
other people have found is that
there's a bimodal response.

1463
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:08,200
So if you look at the number of
cells as a function of the GAL

1464
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,472
operon expression, so
GAL is the expression

1465
01:13:10,472 --> 01:13:12,930
of the genes required to break
down galactose, what you see

1466
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:17,240
is that some of the cells
activate the GAL genes highly,

1467
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,620
some don't activate it at all.

1468
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,420
So the question
is, what might be

1469
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,810
an explanation for this
phenotypic heterogeneity

1470
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:26,190
observed in a clonal population?

1471
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,960
And one way to
think about this is

1472
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,610
that it could be
the implementation

1473
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,420
of some sort of foraging game.

1474
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:34,530
So you can imagine a
population of animals that want

1475
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:36,320
to go and eat some berries.

1476
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,050
So there are two
different food sources--

1477
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,267
say there are blueberries
and there are red berries.

1478
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:43,350
You can imagine this is
the kind of situation that

1479
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,183
would lead to negative
frequency dependence,

1480
01:13:45,183 --> 01:13:47,464
because if everybody
else goes and eats--

1481
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:49,880
I guess this was the blueberry--
so if everybody else goes

1482
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,360
and eats the blueberries,
then it's better for you

1483
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,750
to eat the red berry
because you don't have

1484
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,830
to share with anyone, whereas
if everyone else goes and eats

1485
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,650
the red berries, then
it's better for you

1486
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,460
to eat the blueberries.

1487
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,050
So that's the kind of
situation that would naturally

1488
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,860
lead to the so-called negative
frequency dependent selection,

1489
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,644
in which coexistence
of the phenotypes

1490
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:08,185
is somehow the
equilibrium condition,

1491
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:11,220
and that can be implemented
either by different genotypes

1492
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,830
or it can be implemented
by a single genotype that

1493
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:17,050
follows both phenotypes.

1494
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:20,772
Incidentally, is
this equilibrium--

1495
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:22,730
does it maximize the
fitness of the population?

1496
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:34,260

1497
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:34,760
No.

1498
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,210
So what is it that
would maximize

1499
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:37,460
the fitness of the population?

1500
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,720

1501
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,129
If everybody were a dove,
because-- and you can

1502
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:43,670
you go ahead and do
this calculation,

1503
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,420
find out what the
fitness of everybody is,

1504
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:49,300
but what you'll see is that p
star does not maximize fitness,

1505
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,800
ford not maximize payoff.

1506
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,799
So in these games, the
equilibrium is not necessarily

1507
01:14:56,799 --> 01:14:57,590
fitness maximizing.

1508
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:09,620

1509
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,280
So so far what
we've done is we've

1510
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,510
given two examples of
different evolutionary drivers

1511
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,550
for phenotypic heterogeneity
in a population.

1512
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,924
And I just want
to highlight what

1513
01:15:18,924 --> 01:15:24,360
I think is maybe the last big
one, which would be altruism.

1514
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,480
And sometimes people call
it division of labor,

1515
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,890
or sacrifice or so.

1516
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:33,402
And a nice example of this
is colicin production.

1517
01:15:33,402 --> 01:15:40,790

1518
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,600
The idea is that
in many bacteria,

1519
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,765
they express these
colicin, which are toxins.

1520
01:15:47,765 --> 01:15:49,940
And we're going to read
more about this later.

1521
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,555
So colicin is a toxin.

1522
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:55,020

1523
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,430
And the perhaps
surprising thing is

1524
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:03,497
that in many gram-negative
bacteria, like E. coli, when

1525
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:05,580
they make this colicin,
the only way it's released

1526
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,440
is cell lysis.

1527
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:16,770

1528
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:21,200
Now the question is, why
would I possibly do this?

1529
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,150
And the answer is,
perhaps, that if there's

1530
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,460
a plasmid that encodes the
genes to make this toxin,

1531
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,940
it also encodes an
immunity protein.

1532
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:35,090
What that means is that
if one cell lyses--

1533
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,280
so it bursts open and
releases the colicin--

1534
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,010
it will inhibit other
bacteria, but not

1535
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:43,880
the bacteria that are the
clone mates that are related,

1536
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,065
so not the bacteria that
also carry that plasmid.

1537
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,940
So it's important to
note there that now when

1538
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,760
we talk about kin
selection or relatedness,

1539
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,960
we're talking about the other
cells that carry that gene.

1540
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,990
So what's relevant is that the
plasma that encodes this toxin

1541
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:05,580
will inhibit other bacteria
that do not encode the toxin.

1542
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,560
Now you can see that this
kind of lysis behavior

1543
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,589
has to be stochastic,
so there has

1544
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:11,880
to be phenotypic heterogeneity.

1545
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,546
And why is that?

1546
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:17,280

1547
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,690
AUDIENCE: Everyone always lyses.

1548
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:19,690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1549
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:21,610
If this plasmid always
makes everybody lyse,

1550
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:24,240
then it's not going to
get very far, right?

1551
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,620
But you can kind of
imagine situations

1552
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,270
where, if you just
1% of the population

1553
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,700
lyses but then
inhibits the cells that

1554
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,832
don't care that plasmid,
then the plasmid

1555
01:17:33,832 --> 01:17:35,040
can spread in the population.

1556
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,810

1557
01:17:38,810 --> 01:17:40,740
So this has to be stochastic.

1558
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:51,030

1559
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:53,280
So I think that this is
another general explanation

1560
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,238
for why there might be
phenotypic heterogeneity

1561
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:56,570
in the population.

1562
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:59,560
All of these three explanations
are both conceptually different

1563
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,460
and they're
experimentally different.

1564
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:05,070
They make different
falsifiable predictions

1565
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:08,690
about what's driving that
phenotypic heterogeneity.

1566
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,740
In this field, I think
often when people

1567
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,660
see phenotypic heterogeneity,
they immediately

1568
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:16,080
assume that it's bet
hedging, but these other two

1569
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,660
explanations, I think,
are just as general

1570
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,416
and may be just as common.

1571
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,290
So we really have to go
and make measurements

1572
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:26,280
to try to elucidate what's
going on in each case.
