10
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,360
PROFESSOR: All right, so
today what we're going to do

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,170
is we're just start with
a short review problem

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,070
on rugged landscapes,
just so that you

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,770
get some sense of
the kind of thing

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,330
that I would expect you to be
able to do a week from today.

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,680
And then we'll get into the
core topic of the class, which

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,150
is evolutionary game theory.

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,180
And we'll discuss
why it is that you

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,519
don't need to invoke any
notion of rationality, which

19
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,560
is kind of the traditional
thing we do when we're

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,685
talking about game theory
applied to human decision

21
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:48,820
making.

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,806
Then we'll try to
understand this difference

23
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,180
to know what a Nash equilibrium
is in the context of game

24
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,120
theory versus an
evolutionary stable strategy

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,924
in this context.

26
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,340
And we'll say something about
the evolution of cooperation

27
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,260
and experiments that one can
do with microbial populations

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,010
in the laboratory.

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,600

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,045
Are there any questions
before I get started?

31
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:19,312

32
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:25,330
All right, so just on this
question of evolutionary paths,

33
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,780
on Tuesday we discussed
the Weinreich paper

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,510
where he talked about
sort of different models

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,350
that you might use to try to
make estimates of the path

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,480
that evolution might take
on that fitness landscape

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,930
that he measured.

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,560
So he measured this MIC,
the minimum inhibitory

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,097
concentration, on all 2 to
the 5 or 32 different states,

40
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:47,305
and then tried to say
something about the probability

41
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,370
that different
paths will be taken.

42
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,870
So I just want to
explore this question

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,162
about paths in a
simpler landscape, where

44
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,620
by construction here, I'm to
going to give you some fitness

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,130
values just so that we
can be clear about why

46
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,194
it is that there might
be different paths,

47
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,610
or what determines
the probability

48
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,146
that different paths are taken.

49
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:06,770
So what we want to
do is assume that we

50
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,445
are in a population that is
experiencing this Moran process

51
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:18,660
or Moran model, constant
population size N equal to,

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,780
in this case, we'll say 1,000.

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,740
And let's say that the mutation
rate is 10 to the minus 6.

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,204
So each time that an
individual divides, it has a 1

55
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:32,610
in a million
probability of mutating.

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,785
And that's a per base
pair mutation rate.

57
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,494
And I'll show you
what I mean by that.

58
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,535
And in particular, we're
going to have genotypes.

59
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:44,890

60
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,360
Originally when
we discussed this,

61
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,845
we were talking about just
mutations, maybe A's and B's.

62
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,220
But now, what
we're going to have

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,920
is just a short genome
that's string length 2.

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,890
So we might have 0, 0, which
has relative fitness 1, 0, 1.

65
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:14,880

66
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,810
So we're assuming that
this is relative fitness

67
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,380
as compared to the 0, 0 state.

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,350
We're going to start in
the 0, 0 state with 1,000

69
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,390
isogenic individuals, all 0, 0.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,020
And the question is, what's
going to happen eventually?

71
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,660

72
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:55,980
And in particular, what path
will be taken on this landscape

73
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,480
here?

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,372

75
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:04,830
In particular, what
we want to know

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,000
is the probability
of taking this path.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:33,989

78
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,030
You can start thinking
about it while I write out

79
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,630
some possibilities
that we can vote for,

80
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,626
and I'll give you a
minute to think about it.

81
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:45,090
So don't--

82
00:04:45,090 --> 00:05:19,350

83
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,644
Are there any questions about
what I'm trying to ask here?

84
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:28,299
AUDIENCE: So this
is the long time?

85
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,480
So we assume that
in the long time,

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,880
it will go from 0, 0 to 1, 1?

87
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
PROFESSOR: That's right, yes,
so if we wait long enough,

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,900
the population will get
there, and the 1, 1 genotype

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,210
will fix in the population.

90
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,490
We can talk a bit later
about how long it's

91
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,432
going to take to get
there, and so forth.

92
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,892
AUDIENCE: And we're
assuming that from 0, 1,

93
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:52,342
it can't go back to 0, 0?

94
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,050
PROFESSOR: Right.

95
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah, so we'll
discuss the situations

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,480
when we have to
worry about that,

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,010
and when we don't, and so forth.

98
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,320
But for now, if
you'd like, we can

99
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,400
say that this is even just mu
sub b, the beneficial mutation

100
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,200
rate per base pair, assuming
that the 0's can only

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,770
turn into 1s.

102
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,130
Then after we think
about this, we

103
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,029
could figure out if
that's important,

104
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,570
or when it's important,
and so forth.

105
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,130

106
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes.

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,796
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

108
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:30,880

109
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,540
PROFESSOR: No.

110
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,720
All right, so we're starting
with all 1,000 individuals

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,770
being in the 0, 0
state, because now we're

112
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,187
allowing some mutation rate.

113
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:39,141
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

114
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:45,579

115
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,120
PROFESSOR: And you
also have to think

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,370
about this first mutation--
will it fix or not?

117
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,128

118
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:59,000
AUDIENCE: But it's not
[INAUDIBLE] first mutation,

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,904
the mutation of one
element of that population

120
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:06,141
will go to 0, 1 [INAUDIBLE]?

121
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,390
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure if
I understand your question.

122
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,785
AUDIENCE: So if we start out
with all 0, 0, and then one

123
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:12,755
mutation [INAUDIBLE]?

124
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:16,150

125
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,545
And if that mutation--
are we assuming

126
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,470
that that mutation is 0, 1 and
then figuring out [INAUDIBLE]?

127
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,740
PROFESSOR: Well, OK,
you're asking kind

128
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,902
of what I mean by path here.

129
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess.

130
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, all
right, so I'll say path

131
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,130
means that that this was
the dominant probability

132
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,180
trajectory of the
population through there.

133
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,140
We'll also discuss
whether it somehow

134
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,690
is very likely is going to
kind of have to go through one

135
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,930
or the other of them.

136
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,450
The probability of getting both
mutations in one generation

137
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,230
is going to be 10
to the minus 12.

138
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,040
So that's going to be a very
rare thing, at least given

139
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,157
these parameters, and so forth.

140
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,990
And then there's another
question, which is,

141
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,780
will 0, 1 actually
fix in the population

142
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,247
before you later
fix this population?

143
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:14,580
And actually, I think the
answers to all these questions

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,163
are in principal
already on the board.

145
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:20,330

146
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,404
Because there's a
question of do we

147
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,070
have to worry about
clonal interference?

148
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,060
Are these things neutral or not?

149
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,500
And really, this is in some
ways a very simple problem.

150
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,010
But in another way,
you have to keep

151
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,110
track of lots of
different things,

152
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,080
and which regime
we're in and so forth.

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,820
So that's what makes it such
a wonderful exam problem.

154
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,780
If you understand
what's going on,

155
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,477
you can answer it in a minute.

156
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,310
But if you don't
understand what's going on,

157
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,590
it'll take you an hour.

158
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,010

159
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,510
Yes?

160
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,010
No?

161
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,610
Maybe?

162
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,269
Well, I'll give you
another 20 seconds.

163
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,935
Hopefully, you've
been thinking about it

Why don't we go ahead and vote?

169
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,820
I think it's very
likely that we will not

170
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,889
be at the kind of 100%
mark, in which case

171
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,222
you'll have a chance to talk
about it and think about it

172
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:18,722
some more.

173

OK, all right, so we do have
a fair range of answers.

177
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,050
I'd say it might be kind
of something like 50-50.

178
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,090
And that's great.

179
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,880
It means that there should
be something to talk about.

180
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,072
So turn to a neighbor.

181
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,530
You should be able
to find somebody

182
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,180
that disagrees with you.

183
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,080
And if everyone around you
agrees, you can maybe--

184
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,690
all right, so there's a group
of D's and a group of B's here,

185
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,064
which means that everybody--

186
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,980
AUDIENCE: Let's fight.

187
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,680
PROFESSOR: All
right, so everybody

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,950
thinks that everybody
agrees with them,

189
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,366
but you just need to look a
little bit more long distance.

190
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,270
So turn to a pseudo-neighbor.

191
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,910
You should be able to
find somebody there.

192
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,695
It's roughly even here, so you
should be able to find someone.

So I don't see much in the
way of vibrant discussion

196
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,280
and argument.

All right, it looks like people
are having a nice discussion.

But I might still go
ahead and cut it short,

as a group, so don't

Yes.

220
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,963
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure how good it is,

221
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:51,955
but I was thinking about
what's the probability of going

222
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:55,448
to 0, 1 instead of 1, 0.

223
00:13:55,448 --> 00:14:04,929
And I just took it as the ratio
of the extra benefit of 0, 1

224
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:07,460
over the benefit of 1, 0.

225
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,910
PROFESSOR: Sure, OK,
and just to start out,

226
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,510
which answer are
you arguing for?

227
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,100
AUDIENCE: D.

228
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,130
PROFESSOR: D, OK, all right.

229
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,180
So you're saying D. And
you're saying, all right,

230
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,500
maybe because of the
extra, that 1, 0 is somehow

231
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,520
more fit than 0, 1.

232
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,290
And you've taken some
relative rates or ratios

233
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,218
for which reason?

234
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:31,130
AUDIENCE: Well, I took 0.02
and then 0.1, which is 1/5.

235
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,176
And then I decided
that that should

236
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:36,509
be around what it is, but
slightly less, because there's

237
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,010
also a chance that [INAUDIBLE].

238
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,810
PROFESSOR: OK, yes.

239
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,320
I think the arguments
there-- there's

240
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,730
a lot of truth to the
arguments that you're saying.

241
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,580
Yeah, it's a little--
right and another question

242
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,080
is exactly why might it
be 1/6 instead of 1/5 is,

243
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,630
I think, a little bit
hazy in this here.

244
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,309
It's OK, but it's close.

245
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,100
Does somebody want to
offer an explanation?

246
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,580
So here, that was an argument
of roughly maybe why it's D-ish.

247
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,720
Because D is very
different from B--

248
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,930
order of magnitude different.

249
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,460
So can somebody offer why their
neighbor thought it was B?

250
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
Yeah.

251
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,039
AUDIENCE: So I knew that it was
B, because I considered the two

252
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,631
paths, both from 0, 0 to 0, 1.

253
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,310
I first checked S, N
and it's non-neutral.

254
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,766
So probably [INAUDIBLE]
S. So the probability

255
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:31,378
for that first path
would be the S for 0, 1,

256
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:34,820
so it's 0.02, which is 1/50,
multiplied by the probability

257
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,800
that the other [INAUDIBLE] 1,
0 would die out [INAUDIBLE].

258
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
PROFESSOR: Right, so there
are two related questions.

259
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,150
And I think that
this explanation here

260
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,780
is answering a slightly
different question.

261
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,350
OK, so let me try
to explain what

262
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,050
the two questions are here.

263
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,830
So the question that
you're answering

264
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:58,410
is, if you have kind
of 998 individuals that

265
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,860
are 0, 0 individuals, and
you have one that's 0, 1,

266
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,200
and you have one
individual that is 1, 0.

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,660
So this is like these problems
that we did a couple weeks ago,

268
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,324
where we said, you imagine
in the population you have

269
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:13,740
a couple different kinds of
mutants that are present maybe

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,599
in one copy.

271
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,140
And then we were
asking, well, what's

272
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,930
the probability that this
individual is going to fix?

273
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,440
And what's the probability this
individual is going to fix?

274
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,380
And what's the probability
that these guys are

275
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,580
going to go extinct, and
this one will therefore fix?

276
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,270
And I think that's the
calculation that you're

277
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,440
describing, where
you say, OK, well,

278
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,710
in order for this
individual to fix,

279
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:40,840
he has to survive stochastic
extinction, which happens

280
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,820
with the probability of 2%.

281
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,190
And the 1, 0 individual
has to go extinct,

282
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,220
which happens 90% of the time.

283
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,340
And so this is, indeed,
answering the question

284
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,300
that if you had one copy of each
of these two mutant individuals

285
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,910
in the population,
that's the answer to what

286
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,460
is the probability
that this 0, 1 mutant

287
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,880
would fix in the population.

288
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,300
Right?

289
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,290
But that's a slightly different
question than if we ask,

290
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,236
we're going to start with an
entire population at 0, 0,

291
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,319
and now these mutations
will be occurring randomly

292
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,200
at some rate.

293
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,970
And then something's
going to happen.

294
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,250
Somehow the population
is going to climb up

295
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,349
this fitness landscape.

296
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,230
And we're trying to figure
out the relative probability

297
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,010
that it's going to take
kind of one path or another.

298
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,090
Do you see the difference
between these two questions?

299
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,550
So indeed, this is the correct
answer to a different question.

300
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,260
And so it's going
to end up being D.

301
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,990
And now we want to try to
figure out how to get there.

302
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,310
Because I think it
is a bit tricky.

303
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,580
And in order in order to
figure out to get there,

304
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,860
we have to make sure
we keep track of which

305
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,210
parameter regime we're in.

306
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,390
So there are a couple of
questions we have to ask.

307
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,590
First of all, we
have to remember

308
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,940
that we start out with
everybody, all 1,000

309
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,190
individuals in the 0, 0 state.

310
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,210
So there are initially no
mutants in the population.

311
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,240
But they're just
replicating at some rate.

312
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,910
And every now and then,
mutation's going to occur.

313
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,480
Now one thing we have to
answer, we have to think about,

314
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,550
is whether these are
nearly neutral mutations.

315
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,440

316
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,350
Verbally yes or no?

317
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,850
Ready?

318
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,610
Three, two, one.

319
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,180
AUDIENCE: No.

320
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,570
PROFESSOR: No, right.

321
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,017
And that's because
we want to ask

322
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,850
for, if it's nearly
neutral, we want to ask,

323
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,510
is the magnitude of S times
N much greater or much less

324
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,040
than 1?

325
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,450
In particular, if they're
much greater than 1,

326
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,559
as is the case here, then
we're in a nice, simple regime.

327
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,600
And it's easy to get
paralyzed in this situation,

328
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,920
because there's more than
one S. But in both cases,

329
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,260
S times N is much larger than 1.

330
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,580
We can take the smaller
S, which is 2 over 100,

331
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,540
and S times N is 20, right?

332
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:10,680
So S for the 0, 1
state times N is 20,

333
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,080
which is much greater than 1.

334
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,710
What this tells us
is that if we do

335
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,340
get this mutant appearing
in the population,

336
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,810
then he or she will have a
probability S of surviving

337
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,810
stochastic extinction.

338
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,050

339
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,470
So probability of surviving
stochastic extinction

340
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,220
if the individual
appears is equal to S 0,

341
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,450
1, which is equal to 2%.

342
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:57,500
Whereas for the 1, 0 state,
that's going to be 0.1.

343
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,660
Now, this is assuming
that the mutation appears

344
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,350
in the population, that's the
probability it will survive

345
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,300
stochastic extinction.

346
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,730
Now, just as a reminder,
surviving stochastic extinction

347
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,540
roughly corresponds to this
becoming an established idea.

348
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,600
And becoming established
was what again?

349
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,980

350
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

351
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:23,910
PROFESSOR: What's that?

352
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,090
AUDIENCE: S1 is [INAUDIBLE].

353
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,440
PROFESSOR: It's when S1--

354
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

355
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

356
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,860
All right, so established--
when we say established,

357
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,960
what we mean is that
this corresponds

358
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,280
to saying that this probability
that we talked about

359
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,050
before this X sub i is
approximately equal to 1.

360
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,050
So this question is, how
many individuals do you

361
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,910
have to get to in the
population before you're

362
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,030
very likely to fix?

363
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,130
And what we found is that that
number established went as 1

364
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,570
over the selection coefficient.

365
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,264
So in this case, you would
need to have 50 individuals

366
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,430
before you were kind of
more likely to fix than not.

367
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,013
So if you want to
be much more likely,

368
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:13,420
you might need twice that or so.

369
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,242
Do you guys remember that?

370
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,450
This is not important for
this question, necessarily,

371
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,284
but it might be important
at a later date.

372
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:24,260
AUDIENCE: And so for
nearly neutral mutations,

373
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,989
the whole point is
that the number needed

374
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:29,200
to become established is
equal to the population.

375
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so everything
kind of works, right?

376
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,910

377
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,710
OK, so the way that we
can think about this

378
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,020
is, now we have this
population, 1,000 individuals.

379
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,590
They're dividing at some rate.

380
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,060
Mutations are going to appear.

381
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,640

382
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,270
Now we know if they did appear,
the probability they would fix.

383
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,785
This is assuming there's no
clonal interference, right?

384
00:21:53,785 --> 00:22:05,375

385
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,000
Because if there's
clonal interference,

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,450
then surviving
stochastic extinction

387
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,572
is not the same thing as fixing.

388
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:13,155
If they both appear
in the population,

389
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:15,780
and they both survive
stochastic extinction,

390
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,440
then this mutant
loses to this mutant.

391
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,570
That's the clonal interference.

392
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,236
Do we have to worry about clonal
interference in this situation?

393
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:50,330

394
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,340
So remember, this was
comparing the two time scales.

395
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,400
This was comparing
the time between

396
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:06,998
successive establishment events,
which went as 1 over mu N S.

397
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:11,200
And the other one is the
time between the time to fix,

398
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,130
which went as 1 over
S log of NS, right?

399
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,710
So we can ignore
clonal interference

400
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,180
if this is much
larger than that.

401
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,730

402
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,820
So no clonal
interference corresponds

403
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:32,960
to mu N log NS much less than 1.

404
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,860
No clonal interference,
same as this statement.

405
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,480
Is that right?

406
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,630

407
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,386
Did I do it right?

408
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,920
OK.

409
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,650
So and once again, there
are multiple S's, and it's

410
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,220
easy to get kind of
upset about this.

411
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,096
But you can just use
whichever S would be--

412
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,970
which S would you want
to use to be kind of--

413
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,221

414
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:58,762
AUDIENCE: Small or
large [INAUDIBLE]?

415
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:01,400

416
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,550
PROFESSOR: To be on the
safe or conservative side,

417
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,760
we want to take this to
be as big as possible.

418
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,120
So we take S actually
as big as we can, right?

419
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,250
It's in the log.

420
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,720
So details, right?

421
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:20,900
But we can see we have 10
to the minus 6, 10 to the 3,

422
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:28,430
and then this is the
log of maybe 100, which

423
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,012
is, like, 4 or 5.

424
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,970
Is it closer to 4 or 5?

425
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,480
I don't know, but
it doesn't matter.

426
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
We'll say 5.

427
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,070
This is indeed much less than 1.

428
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:43,420

429
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,010
So indeed, we
don't have to worry

430
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,680
about clonal interference.

431
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,240
This is a wonderful
simplification.

432
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,440
What it's saying is that
the population is dividing.

433
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,760
Every now and then, a mutation
occurs in the population.

434
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,290
It could be either
the 0, 1 or the 1, 0.

435
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,000
But in either case, the
fate of that mutation

436
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,039
is resolved before the
next mutation occurs.

437
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,580
So you don't need
to worry about them

438
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,900
competing in the population.

439
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,440
Instead, just at some constant
rate they're appearing.

440
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,290
And given that they appear,
there's some probability

441
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,610
that they're going to fix.

442
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,420
So that leads to effective
rates going to each of those two

443
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,690
steps-- going to 0, 1 or 1, 0.

444
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,570
And in particular, this is like
a chemical reaction, where we

445
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,110
have some chemical state here.

446
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,540
We have two rates.

447
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,760
There's the k going to 0,
1, the k going to 1, 0.

448
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,410

449
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,899
And what we know is we know
the ratio of those rates.

450
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,440
And that's everything
we need to know

451
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,481
to calculate the relative
probabilities of taking

452
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:50,810
those states, because the
probability of going through

453
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,960
to 0, 1-- we want to go
that direction-- 0, 1, this

454
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:02,330
is going to be given by k 0, 1
divided by k 0, 1 plus k 1, 0.

455
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,810
So this is how we get
1/6 instead of 1/5.

456
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,950
Because this thing
is 1/5 of that.

457
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,870
So it's like 1, and then 1, 5.

458
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:21,140

459
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,270
So this is actually, in
principle, not quite answering

460
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,320
the question that I
asked, because this

461
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,250
is talking about the relative
probability of the first state,

462
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,120
the first mutant to fix.

463
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,780
In principle, it is possible
that from there, there's

464
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,040
some rate of coming back.

465
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,214
Or they might not necessarily
move forward on up that hill.

466
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:42,130
Do you guys understand
what I'm talking about?

467
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,588
Because it goes
from here to there.

468
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:47,520
Because we really want to
know about this next step,

469
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,290
going to the 1, 1 state.

470
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,980

471
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,760
But in this case do we have to
worry about going backwards?

472
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,320
No.

473
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,990
And why not?

474
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,910

475
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,720
It's very unlikely.

476
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,502
And in particular,
you could think now

477
00:27:05,502 --> 00:27:07,710
that you're here you can
talk about the rate of going

478
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,310
to the 1, 1 state as compared
to the rate of going to 0, 1.

479
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:17,080
And those are going to be
exponentially different.

480
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,950
Because just as this was
a non-neutral beneficial

481
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,820
mutation, that means
that going from 0,

482
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,260
1 back is going to be a
non-neutral deleterious

483
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,685
mutation.

484
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,310
So the probability of fixing it
in the back direction is not 0,

485
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,726
but it's exponentially
suppressed.

486
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:36,060

487
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,890
I think it's very
important to understand

488
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,290
all the different pieces
of this kind of puzzle,

489
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,070
because it incorporates many
different ideas that we've

490
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,665
talked about over
the last few weeks.

491
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,480
If there are questions,
please ask now.

492
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,277
Yes.

493
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,818
AUDIENCE: What about
the [INAUDIBLE]?

494
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:58,285

495
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:09,219
[INAUDIBLE] 0, 0
to 1, 0 to 1, 1?

496
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:13,195
Then it seems like the benefit
of 1, 0 versus [INAUDIBLE].

497
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:15,700

498
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,300
PROFESSOR: All right, so
you're wondering about--

499
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,810
so the fitness of the
1, 1 state was 1.2.

500
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,860
So you're pointing out
that it's actually easier

501
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,700
to go from the 0, 1
state to the 1, 1 as

502
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,645
compared to the
1, 0 to the 1, 1.

503
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:34,615
AUDIENCE: Right, which
seems like a reason for why

504
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:38,486
we wouldn't care
about [INAUDIBLE].

505
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:39,610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, right.

506
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,810
So if anything,
in some ways, this

507
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,590
actually provides a bias
going towards the 0, 1 state,

508
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,456
because it's saying that
if we do get to 0, 1,

509
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:51,080
it's actually easier
to move forward as

510
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,324
compared to this other path.

511
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:53,990
In practice, it doesn't
actually matter,

512
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,890
because this acts as a ratchet.

513
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,220
Because all these
mutations are non-neutral,

514
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,660
once you fix this state or
this one, you can't go back.

515
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,980
So the population
will move forward

516
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,835
once it gets to one
of those two states.

517
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,960
Now I mean, it would be a
very interesting question

518
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,920
to ask if we instead did
a different arrangement.

519
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,060
What would the rate of
evolution be, and so forth?

520
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,690
Yeah, but what you're
saying is certainly true,

521
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,360
that if this took up all
of the benefit going here,

522
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,957
then it may not
actually be somehow

523
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:28,540
an optimal path in terms of the
rate of evolution or something

524
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,039
like that.

525
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,420

526
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,510
I'll think about
that when designing.

527
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,848
Problems.

528
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:42,560
AUDIENCE: In this system, 0,
0 eventually becomes 1, 1.

529
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
PROFESSOR: That's right.

530
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,590
AUDIENCE: So the
probability is 1.

531
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,310
PROFESSOR: That's right,
so we are guaranteed

532
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,470
that we will eventually evolve
to this peak in the fitness

533
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,970
landscape.

534
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,430
And so what we're asking here
is which of these two paths

535
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,621
is going to be taken.

536
00:29:58,621 --> 00:30:02,058
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so how
to mathematically prove

537
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:06,995
that the system will
go from 0, 0 to 1, 1?

538
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,120
PROFESSOR: I mean, I feel
like I kind of proved it,

539
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,411
although I understand that
nothing I said was rigorous.

540
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:15,580

541
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,670
And of course, there are
non-zero probabilities

542
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,620
of going backwards.

543
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,390
It's just that they are reduced.

544
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,510
And actually, you can
prove, for those of you

545
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,580
who are interested
in such things,

546
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,510
that over long time
scales, there's

547
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,260
going to be an equilibrium
that distribution

548
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:40,610
over all these states, where
the probability of being

549
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:47,490
in a particular state will--
it goes as the fitness.

550
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,100
It scales as the relative
fitness to the Nth power.

551
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,620

552
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,940
So we talk about these
fitness landscapes

553
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,670
as energy landscapes.

554
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,760
And indeed, in this regime where
you have small mutation rates,

555
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,550
then it's going to be
a detailed balance.

556
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,570
And it's actually a
thermodynamic system.

557
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,930
So then in that case, you
can make a correspondence

558
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,210
between everything that
we normally talk about,

559
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,020
where fitness is like
energy and population

560
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,720
size is like temperature.

561
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,610
So the relative amplitude of
being in this peak as compared

562
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,670
to the other states is
going to be, in this case,

563
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,150
the ratios of those things
is, indeed, described

564
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,160
by the ratios of the fitnesses.

565
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,550
And it's going to go as kind of
like 1.1 to the 1,000th power,

566
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,690
which is big.

567
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,760
Which means that the
population has really

568
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,500
cohered at this peak in
the finished landscape.

569
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,726
Yeah.

570
00:31:48,726 --> 00:31:52,386
AUDIENCE: So if you want to
calculate a problem going

571
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:57,022
from 0, 1 to 0, 0,
then [INAUDIBLE]

572
00:31:57,022 --> 00:32:01,440
that would just be--
I guess I'm not sure.

573
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,225
PROFESSOR: OK, you
want to know the rate

574
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,080
that that's going to happen.

575
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

576
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:04,990
PROFESSOR: No, that's fine.

577
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,690
Let's do that.

578
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,170

579
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,110
So for example,
let's imagine that we

580
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:23,650
don't have-- so let's imagine
that we just have the 0, 0

581
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,190
and the 0, 1 states, just
so we don't have to worry

582
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,980
about going up the landscape.

583
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:38,090
And so what we have is we have r
is relative fitness 1 and 1.02.

584
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,200
Now what we want to do
is we want to ask, well,

585
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,390
what is the rate of
going back and forth?

586
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:51,620
Well, so the rate
of going forward,

587
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,760
well, we sample
mutations at a rate mu.

588
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,980
And this is mu only
for this one state,

589
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,270
because pretend that we're not
going to mutate this other one.

590
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:07,580
So rate mu N, you have
mutations appearing.

591
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,789
And times this s, 0.02,
is the probability

592
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,830
that it'll actually fix
in the forward direction.

593
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,580

594
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,700
And now what we want to know
is the rate of coming back.

595
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,720
Well, the beginning
part's the same,

596
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,640
because we have mu N
is the rate that you

597
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,970
get this deleterious
mutant in the population.

598
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,595
But then we need to multiply it
by the probability of fixation.

599
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:33,720

600
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,630
And the probability
of fixation is--

601
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:43,290
there was this thing X1, which
was 1 minus-- now this is r,

602
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,670
but it's r in the other
direction, so be careful.

603
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,550
Because the general
equation was 1 over.

604
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,620

605
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,750
But now r, instead of
being 1.02, is 1/1.02.

606
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,360

607
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,000
So which of these terms
is going to be dominant?

608
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,540
This thing gets up to be
some really big number

609
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,090
is our problem.

610
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,780
So we should be able to
figure this out, though.

611
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,389
Because this new r is 1/1.02.

612
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:21,300
So we for example, have 1
minus 1.02, 1 minus 1.02

613
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,754
to the 1,000.

614
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:26,420
All right, so this
is a negative number,

615
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,878
but this is a
negative number, too.

616
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:37,925
So we end up with 0.02--

617
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,280
AUDIENCE: 200.

618
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,550
PROFESSOR: Is it 200?

619
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,139
Yeah, you're keeping
only the first,

620
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,000
which, since it's much larger
than 1, it's bigger than 200.

621
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,500
Right?

622
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,480
I mean do you guys
understand what I'm saying?

623
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,550
You can't keep just the
first term in a series.

624
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,070
If the terms grow with number.

625
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
squared, 3.98 or something.

626
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,948
PROFESSOR: Wait, which one?

627
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:07,760
AUDIENCE: 1.02 to the 1,000.

628
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
PROFESSOR: It's 4?

629
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,440
OK, all right.

630
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,040
OK, so it's 1 minus 4.

631
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,200
So it's 2/300.

632
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,430
OK, so this is teamwork, right?

633
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,859
OK, so there's less than a
1% probability of it fixing.

634
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:31,650
Is this believable?

635
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:37,592

636
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:39,972
AUDIENCE: It's about right.

637
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:47,055
PROFESSOR: 2,
1,000, 50-- I think

638
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:52,465
that you did it 1.02 to the 100
rather than 1.02 to the 1,000.

639
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:54,900
AUDIENCE: OK.

640
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,330
PROFESSOR: No?

641
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,987
Do you not have it
in front of you?

642
00:35:57,987 --> 00:35:59,448
AUDIENCE: No, it's
3-- [INAUDIBLE].

643
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,857

644
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:05,407
AUDIENCE: 4 times 10 to the 8.

645
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,240
AUDIENCE: I never thought
that my calculator

646
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,710
would become so controversial.

647
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,126
AUDIENCE: Oh, 4
times 10 to the 8.

648
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:18,440

649
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,080
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry,
I was just saying this

650
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,580
doesn't-- so this is why I'm
saying you always check to make

651
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,900
sure that your calculation
makes any sense at all.

652
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,780
So it's not this.

653
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,817
But it's tiny, right?

654
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:34,620
AUDIENCE: Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

655
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
this didn't make sense,

656
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,520
because this was of the
same order as-- well,

657
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,772
this would be larger than 1 over
N, so it's totally nonsensical.

658
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,980
Because 1 over N would be
the probability of fixation

659
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,050
of a neutral mutation.

660
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,182
This is a deleterious mutation.

661
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:50,390
It's not even nearly neutral.

662
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,481
So it has to be much less
than 1 over N, right?

663
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:58,317
So this whole thing
is 10 to the minus 10,

664
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,275
or something like that?

665
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:03,300

666
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,309
OK, 4 times 10 to the minus 8.

667
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,100
Well, OK, whatever.

668
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,620

669
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,630
It's 10 to the minus 9.

670
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,440
It's something small.

671
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,080
So this times the probability of
fixation, which is 10 minus 9--

672
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,607
this is how you would calculate
the rate of going backwards.

673
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:22,440
There's some rate that
the mutation appears,

674
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,450
and you multiply by the
probability that it would fix.

675
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,120
And it's tiny.

676
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,520

677
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,020
OK?

678
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,960

679
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,950
All right, any other
questions about how

680
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,120
to think about these sorts
of evolutionary dynamics

681
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,594
with presence of mutation,
fixation, everything?

682
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,814
Yeah.

683
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,272
AUDIENCE: Can we
handle a situation

684
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:48,350
where [INAUDIBLE] interference
is important at this point?

685
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,150
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
what you do in your problem set

686
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,090
with simulations.

687
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,590
Yeah.

688
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,923
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] numerical.

689
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:59,780
PROFESSOR: You know,
I think that it

690
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,988
gets really messy with clonal
interference, I'll say.

691
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,059
AUDIENCE: But,
like, with basic--

692
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:07,308
I guess I was thinking about
it and you could probably

693
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:10,284
imagine that [INAUDIBLE]
calculate the probability

694
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:14,760
that 1, 0 doesn't arise first.

695
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,500
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah, OK,
this is an important statement.

696
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,850
In the limit, as you get
more and more mutations, when

697
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,600
clonal interference
is really significant,

698
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,224
then you're pretty
much just guaranteed

699
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:25,600
to take the 1, 0 path.

700
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,037
Because if you
have many mutants,

701
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,870
the definition of clonal
interference is you

702
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,332
have multiple mutations
that have established.

703
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:35,040
And once you have
multiple mutations that

704
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,350
have established, then it's
likely that one of them

705
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,520
is going to be this.

706
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,957
And if it's established,
it's going to win.

707
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:44,540
But the other thing is that as
you go up in the mutation rate,

708
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,260
you don't even do
successive fixations.

709
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,785
So it may be that neither
state ever actually fixes,

710
00:38:50,785 --> 00:38:52,410
because it could be
that the 1, 0 state

711
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,100
is growing exponentially, but
is a minority of the population.

712
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,740
And it gets another mutation
that allows it to go to 1, 1.

713
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,000
So as you increase
the mutation rate,

714
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,450
you don't have to actually
take single steps.

715
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,730
You can kind of
move through states.

716
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,760
And there's a whole literature
of the rate at which you

717
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,410
cross fitness valleys.

718
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,650
So this is like tunneling
in quantum mechanics or so.

719
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,275
And it has a lot of
the same behaviors,

720
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:17,029
in the sense of exponential
suppression of probabilities

721
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:19,570
as a function of the depth and
the width of the valley you're

722
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,390
trying to traverse.

723
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,870
And there's some
very nice papers,

724
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,420
if you're interested in
looking at this stuff.

725
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,775
And one of them is actually in
the syllabus that I mentioned.

726
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:29,900
I'm trying to remember who.

727
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,020
It was Journal of
Theoretical Biology,

728
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,629
but I put it on as optional
reading for those of you

729
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:35,420
who are interested.

730
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,470

731
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,505
All right, OK.

732
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,630
So what I want to do now
is I want to switch gears,

733
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,330
so we can think about this
evolutionary game theory

734
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:45,829
business.

735
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:49,950

736
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,830
And I think the
most important thing

737
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,200
to stress when thinking about
evolutionary game theory

738
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,721
is just that this point that we
don't need to assume anything

739
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:58,470
about rationality.

740
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,750

741
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:10,270
Because the puzzles that we like
to give each other in your dorm

742
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,600
rooms Friday night,
you give these logic

743
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,850
puzzles to each other.

744
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,140
Is that-- I don't know.

745
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,330
[LAUGHTER]

746
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,330
OK, let me just say, back when I
was in college, that was, like,

747
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,930
all the cool kids were doing it.

748
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,600
But in these puzzles, you assume
that there's hyper-rationality.

749
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,130
You assume that
if this guy knows

750
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,896
that I did this,
and that, and if I

751
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:35,020
did that, he would do that.

752
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,645
And then you end
up, and then you

753
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,270
have the villagers
that are jumping off

754
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,625
cliffs on the seventh day.

755
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,000
Have you guys done
these puzzles?

756
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,360
No?

757
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,720
OK.

758
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:42,980
All right.

759
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,480
Well.

760
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,960
[LAUGHTER]

761
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,620
So the point was
that people assume

762
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,740
that when we're talking
about game theory,

763
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,320
you have to invoke this
hyper-rationality even

764
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,060
humans don't engage in.

765
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,130
And I think that it's
just very important

766
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,379
to remember that we're talking
about evolutionary game

767
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:04,990
theory in the case of,
well, biological evolution.

768
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,840
You don't assume anything
about rationality.

769
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,656
Instead, you simply have
mutations that sample

770
00:41:11,656 --> 00:41:12,530
different strategies.

771
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,550

772
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:26,050
And then you have
differences in fitness

773
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,470
that just lead to evolution
towards the same solutions

774
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,080
of the game.

775
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,710
So it's evolution to
the game solutions,

776
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,710
so the Nash equilibrium,
for example.

777
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,020

778
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,840
So it's not that we
think that the cells are

779
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,210
engaging in any sort of
weird puzzle solving.

780
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,290
Instead, they're just mutations.

781
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:56,190
And the more fit individuals
spread in the population.

782
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,400
And somehow, you evolve to
the same or similar solutions,

783
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,360
to these Nash equilibria in
the context of game theory.

784
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,190

785
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,040
And we'll see how this plays
out in a few concrete examples.

786
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,130

787
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,640
Now, there are always different
ways of looking at these games.

788
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,579
One thing I want to
stress, though, is that all

789
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,120
the selection that
we've been talking

790
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,210
about in the last
few weeks, that all

791
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,250
is consistent with game
theory in the sense

792
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,500
that the idea of
the game theory is

793
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,200
that we allow for
the possibility

794
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,240
that the fitness of
individuals depends

795
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,060
upon the rest of the population.

796
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,200
Whereas in all these
calculations we've been doing,

797
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,210
I told you, all right, I
just gave you some fitnesses.

798
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,550
So I said, here we have a 0,
0 state that has some fitness.

799
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,090
0, 1 has a higher
fitness, and so forth.

800
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,050
But in general,
these fitness values

801
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,990
may depend upon what the
population composition is.

802
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,590
And in that situation, then you
want to use evolutionary game

803
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,910
theory.

804
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,870
In many cases,
people just assume

805
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,950
that you can do something like
this-- that you can describe it

806
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,290
as some fitness landscape.

807
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,950
But you can't do that if
there's this frequency-dependent

808
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,260
selection-- if there's any
sort of evolutionary game

809
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,340
interactions going on.

810
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,410
So it's just important.

811
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,280
If the fitnesses
depend on composition--

812
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,990
this is the population
composition--

813
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,610
then you cannot even
define a fitness landscape.

814
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,250

815
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,430
Then no fitness landscape.

816
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,800

817
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,120
For example, you can have
situations where the population

818
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,700
evolves to lower fitness.

819
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,510
So you can have a
situation where,

820
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,040
if I tell you individual
0, you measure its growth

821
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,760
rate, whatnot, its
fitness might be 1.

822
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,680
So this is genome,
and this is fitness.

823
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,090
Now, if I go and I
measure the fitness

824
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,380
of some other individual,
different genome-- so

825
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,480
another strain of bacteria
or yeast or whatever--

826
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,650
and you say, oh, well,
its fitness is 1.2.

827
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,730
So this strain has higher
fitness than this strain.

828
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:32,160
Now, it would be very natural
to assume that this strain will

829
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,380
out-compete this strain.

830
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,080
And indeed, that's been the
assumption in everything

831
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,690
we've been talking about.

832
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,580
But it's not necessarily true.

833
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,840
And that's the basic insight
of evolutionary game theory,

834
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,130
is that just knowing the
fitness of a pure population

835
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,110
is not actually enough
information to know that it's

836
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,600
going to be selected for.

837
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,800
Because it's still possible
that in a mixed population,

838
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,880
the genome 0 may actually
have higher fitness

839
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,892
than the genome 1.

840
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:06,050

841
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,760
And once you kind of
study these things,

842
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,430
it's kind of clear
that it can happen.

843
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,800
But then it's easy to
then go back to the lab

844
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,900
and forget that it's true.

845
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,930

846
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,933
And so we'll see
how this plays out.

847
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:25,790
AUDIENCE: On this game
theory, [INAUDIBLE]?

848
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,530
PROFESSOR: No.

849
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,710
That's the other
thing, is that I

850
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,842
like to just draw these
things as graphs, because I

851
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,800
think it's much easier
to see what's happening.

852
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
And it's clear that
things can be non-linear.

853
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,940
But the basic insights
are all intact.

854
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,800
From my standpoint as kind
of an experimentalist--

855
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,090
don't forget about
the exam-- I think

856
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,689
that the more formal
evolutionary game theory

857
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:52,730
thing-- these two-player
games that you guys just

858
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,200
read about-- I think they're
important because they tell you

859
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,054
what are the possible outcomes
of measurements or of systems,

860
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:02,220
even in the most simple
situation where everything's

861
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:02,950
linear.

862
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,700
Now, when things are
not linear, of course

863
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,530
you can get even
richer dynamics.

864
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,391
But in practice, you basically
get the categories of outcomes

865
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:11,140
that we saw there.

866
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:22,230

867
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:27,350
So maybe what I'll do is--
so what we're going to do

868
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,380
is think about competition
between two individuals

869
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:38,260
A and B. And often, we
talk about these things

870
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,866
in the context of the two-player
games, where we have A, B, C,

871
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:47,390
D. And because this is really
importing the kind of approach,

872
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,230
or the nomenclature, from
conventional game theory,

873
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,020
and then immediately applying
it to populations where you just

874
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,990
assume that all the
individuals have

875
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,280
equal probability of
interacting with everybody

876
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,317
in the population.

877
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,900
So it's what you
would get if you just

878
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,850
had some two-player game like
they study in game theory,

879
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,290
but in a population
of 1,000 or whatnot.

880
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,790
You just made a bunch of
random pairwise interactions.

881
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,930
You had them play the game.

882
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,846
And then you had them
do that again over time.

883
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:18,550
And then this is the
payouts that you read about

884
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,577
in Chapter Four are kind
of what would happen

885
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:22,410
in that sort of situation,
where everybody's

886
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,020
interacting with everybody
else with equal probability.

887
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,450
Now, remember the
way that you read

888
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,340
this is that, depending upon
the strategy that these guys are

889
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,590
following, you get
different payouts.

890
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:41,990
And normally what we say
is that if this could be,

891
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,350
for example, strategy one and
two, strategy one and two.

892
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,880
And this is telling
us about the payout

893
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,670
that the A individual gets
depending on what he does,

894
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,986
and depending upon
what his opponent does.

895
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:55,360
Now, we're not explicitly
saying what the payout to the B

896
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,785
individual is,
but we're assuming

897
00:47:56,785 --> 00:47:59,160
that this is a symmetric game,
so you could figure it out

898
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,290
by looking at the
opposite entry.

899
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:05,710
So if A follows strategy
one, B follows strategy one,

900
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,420
then individual A
gets little a fitness,

901
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,030
whereas B also gets
little a fitness,

902
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,840
because it's a symmetric game.

903
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,930
So the case it's different is
when we're in the diagonals.

904
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,410

905
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,240
And from this
framework, you can see

906
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,470
that there are
going to be already

907
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,550
a bunch of kind of
non-trivial things

908
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,470
that can happen, even in this
regime where everything's

909
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,750
linear.

910
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:42,070
And the probably best
well-known of these

911
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:50,500
is this Prisoner's
Dilemma, which

912
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,770
is the standard
model of cooperation

913
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,949
in the field of game theory.

914
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:56,740
So there's a story that
goes along with it.

915
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:02,120
It's this idea that-- I'm sure
you guys watch these cop shows,

916
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,110
where you have the cops
bring in the two accomplices.

917
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,300
And then they put them
in separate rooms.

918
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,220
And they tell them
that they have

919
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,520
to confess to
committing the crime,

920
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,800
because the guy in the
other room is confessing,

921
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,300
and if he doesn't
confess, then he's

922
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,880
going to be in
trouble, et cetera.

923
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,470
You've seen these cop shows?

924
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,900
And incidentally,
in these questions,

925
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,510
when cops are
questioning witnesses,

926
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:31,730
they're actually allowed to lie
to the person being questioned,

927
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,250
which feels a little
bit weird, actually.

928
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,670
Doesn't it?

929
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,630
I know, I know, this
is not relevant.

930
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,459

931
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,000
So the idea of the
prisoner's dilemma

932
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,787
is that if you set up these
jail sentences in the right way,

933
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:48,870
then it could be the case
that each individual has

934
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,260
the incentive to confess, even
though both individuals would

935
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,200
be better off if
they cooperated.

936
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,132
And you can come up with some
reasonable payout structure

937
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,090
that has that property.

938
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:18,000

939
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,515
And we'll call this-- so
this is for individual one,

940
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:26,010
say and individual two.

941
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,550
So there are different
strategies you can follow.

942
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,920
And do you guys remember
from the reading

943
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,800
slash my explanation how
to read these charts?

944
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,460

945
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,510
All right, now the question
is, just to remind ourselves,

946
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,370
what is the Nash
equilibrium of this game?

947
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,290

948
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,300
And I know that you read
about it last night.

949
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,640
Well, use your cards.

950
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,190
Is it C or is it D?

951
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,910
Or is there no Nash equilibrium,
you can flash something else.

952
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:10,590

953
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,520
AUDIENCE: Are those
negative or positive?

954
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,103
PROFESSOR: These are
positive fitness.

955
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:16,670

956
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,970
I kind of don't like the
Prisoner's Dilemma as a story,

957
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,164
because it's not very
intuitive, because you

958
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,830
have to actually
specify the jail terms,

959
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,990
and you have to remember that
jail terms are bad, not good.

960
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,370
So these are good things, OK?

961
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:30,960
These are years off
that you get as a result

962
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,210
of doing one thing or another.

963
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,930

964
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,560
You want to get big numbers.

965
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,360
Ready?

966
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,220
Three, two, one.

967
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,640

968
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,980
So at least we have a
majority that are D,

969
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,270
but it's not all of them.

970
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,300
And I think this is
basically a reflection--

971
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
and D is indeed the
Nash equilibrium.

972
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,550

973
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,690
It's to do this strategy
D that we're saying here.

974
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,060
All right, now the
question is why?

975
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,320
And part of the challenge
here is just understanding

976
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,540
how to read these charts.

977
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,670
Now, first of all, the payout
that everybody gets if everyone

978
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,130
follows strategy D is what?

979
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,130
Verbally, three, two, one.

980
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,170
AUDIENCE: One.

981
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,440
PROFESSOR: So everybody
gets payout one.

982
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,100
Now, if you look
at this chart, you

983
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,410
say, well, gee, that is a shame.

984
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:28,900
Because 1 is just not the
biggest number you see here.

985
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,820
And indeed, the
important point to note

986
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,670
here is that if both players
had followed this strategy

987
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,930
C for cooperate, D for defect,
then both individuals would be

988
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:43,840
getting fitness 3, or payout 3.

989
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,550
So the idea here is that
both individuals would

990
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,140
do better if they both
played strategy C.

991
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,660
But the problem is that that's
not evolutionarily stable.

992
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,590
Or in the context
of game theory,

993
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,770
that is cheatable in some ways.

994
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,020
And so the reason that
this is a Nash equilibrium

995
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,890
is that you ask-- so a Nash
equilibrium, what it means,

996
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,070
if you recall, is
that if everyone's

997
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,640
playing that strategy, then
nobody has the incentive

998
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,770
to change strategy.

999
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,825
So no incentive to
change strategy.

1000
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:17,902

1001
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:19,360
So now you just
imagine, let's say,

1002
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,390
that you're playing
against somebody else,

1003
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,100
or in the context
of biology, it's

1004
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,746
a population of individuals
following the D strategy.

1005
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,740
The question is whether
you as an individual

1006
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:32,040
would have the incentive to
switch to the other strategy?

1007
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,830
And the answer is no, because
what you have control over

1008
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,510
is this rows.

1009
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,450
The column is specified by
the rest of the population.

1010
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,095
So if you're in this state,
what you have a choice of

1011
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:47,612
is to switch to the
cooperate strategy, which

1012
00:53:47,612 --> 00:53:48,570
would be to go up here.

1013
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,890
So you have a choice to
move up to this 0 payout,

1014
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,732
but that's not to
your advantage.

1015
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,940
Now, it's true that your
opponent would get payout 5.

1016
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,170
So you opponent would
actually do wonderfully.

1017
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,370
But you would do poorly.

1018
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,890
So you'd be selected
against, if you imagine

1019
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,980
this being in the
context of biology--

1020
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,990
that you have a genotype
that are playing

1021
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,120
D. If you're a mutant that
starts following this strategy

1022
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,627
C, you have lower fitness,
so you're selected against.

1023
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:19,835
So that's saying that the
strategy D is noninvadable.

1024
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:23,050

1025
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,040
We can also think about
what happens if we're

1026
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,710
a population of cooperators.

1027
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,251
Now everybody has high
fitness-- fitness 3.

1028
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:32,750
Question is, what
happens if there's

1029
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,070
a mutation that leads to one
individual following the D

1030
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:35,570
strategy?

1031
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:41,560

1032
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,426
Is he selected four or not?

1033
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:46,320
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1034
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,570
PROFESSOR: Yes,
so the point here

1035
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,410
is that you always will
have higher fitness,

1036
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:57,010
regardless of what your opponent
does in the context of a game

1037
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,260
theory situation, or
regardless of the distribution

1038
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,910
of cooperation and
defection in the population.

1039
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,410
It's always better
to be a defector.

1040
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:05,280

1041
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,308
So the problem here is, it's
always better to play D.

1042
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:21,280

1043
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,911
Now, I really like drawing
the graphs of these things,

1044
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,660
because I think it's
just much more clear.

1045
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,770

1046
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,940
And you can either
draw the fitness

1047
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,860
of the two types minus each
other, or just the raw fitness.

1048
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,086
Yes.

1049
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:45,537
AUDIENCE: So what if
instead of 5, you have 7?

1050
00:55:45,537 --> 00:55:49,830
Because then the population
as a whole's fitness

1051
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:54,123
decreases when you [INAUDIBLE].

1052
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:56,680
So how does that--

1053
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,236
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
if this 5 were a 7 instead?

1054
00:55:59,236 --> 00:55:59,930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1055
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,950
PROFESSOR: Right, then
what you're saying

1056
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,020
is that-- so it doesn't change.

1057
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,940
The Nash equilibrium
is still defect.

1058
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:13,600
The subtle thing here
is that, in general,

1059
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,180
in terms of game theory, we like
it when the mean of these two

1060
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,437
is smaller than this one.

1061
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:20,770
That's why you're asking, right?

1062
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,120
Exactly, because that's right.

1063
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,130
Exactly, right.

1064
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,630
So yeah, so that's a slightly
more complicated situation,

1065
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,490
because in that situation, then,
if you had two rational agents,

1066
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,820
say, playing this game, then
you could alternate cooperation

1067
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,940
and defection.

1068
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,060
And that would actually be the
ultimate form of cooperation

1069
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,030
in such a game, because you
could actually get a higher

1070
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,180
payout by alternating.

1071
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,390
Right, so we've
chosen the numbers

1072
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:54,480
as they are so that this is
subtlety is not an issue.

1073
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,280
Does everybody understand
the issue there?

1074
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,030

1075
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,850
So in the context of
evolutionary game theory, what

1076
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:07,030
we can do is we can plot as
a function of the fraction

1077
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,610
of the population that's
cooperator between 0 and 1,

1078
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,770
say.

1079
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:16,420
And we can plot the
payout for the cooperator

1080
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,350
and for the defector.

1081
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:23,020

1082
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:29,510
For example, I'm going to draw
a solid line for the cooperator,

1083
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:32,450
dashed line for the defector.

1084
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:39,150
Now the question is, what should
be the y-axes on either ends

1085
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:39,730
and so forth?

1086
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:40,479
Do you understand?

1087
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:43,030

1088
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,850
So what should these
things look like?

1089
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,780
I'd like to encourage
you to-- I'll

1090
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,055
give you 30 seconds
to try to draw

1091
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:52,180
what this should look like.

1092
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:59,610
So this is the payout
or the expected payout.

1093
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,610
So we're assuming that you're
going to interact randomly

1094
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,860
with the other members of
the population as a function

1095
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,290
of the fraction cooperator.

1096
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,570
So then 1 minus that will
be the fraction defector.

1097
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,170

1098
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,321
Do you understand what I'm
trying to ask you to do?

1099
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:17,966
AUDIENCE: So the scale on
the right-hand side supposed

1100
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:20,140
to be for the defectors?

1101
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,759
[INAUDIBLE]?

1102
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:24,050
PROFESSOR: This is just a
legend, or key, or something.

1103
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,630
So I want you to draw
something over here that's

1104
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,030
a solid line and a dashed line.

1105
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,380
AUDIENCE: All right,
so it's just one scale.

1106
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,005
And you don't--

1107
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,088
PROFESSOR: It's one scale.

1108
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:32,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1109
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,614
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

1110
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:36,780
I'm just telling you what's
going to be a solid line

1111
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,540
and what's going to
be a dashed line.

1112
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,290
And I'll give you a hint,
that up here is number 5.

1113
00:58:42,290 --> 00:59:23,450

1114
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,775
This is going to be the expected
payout for a lone individual

1115
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,650
given the rest of the
population is following

1116
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,070
some fraction of cooperator.

1117
00:59:31,070 --> 01:00:05,630

1118
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,136
Do you guys understand
what I'm asking you to do?

1119
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:10,010
Because I'm a little
bit concerned that there

1120
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,706
are very few plots in front.

1121
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:16,020
AUDIENCE: What is fc?

1122
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,660
PROFESSOR: So this is the
fraction of the population

1123
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,409
that's cooperator.

1124
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:40,700

1125
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,530
Well, I was giving you a
chance to think about it.

1126
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,930
But from looking around,
I think that maybe you're

1127
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,960
not quite sure what I'm
trying to ask you to do.

1128
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,964
So I'm trying to plot
the expected payout

1129
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:53,380
for an individual that is
either cooperating or defecting,

1130
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,421
based on the fact that
the rest of the population

1131
01:00:55,421 --> 01:01:00,590
has some composition between
all cooperate or all defect.

1132
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,170
So it's the evolution
game theory extension

1133
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:06,460
of this simple model.

1134
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:11,360
So first, we can ask, well,
if the entire population is

1135
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,460
cooperating, we want to know
the fitness for a cooperator

1136
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,000
or defector.

1137
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,710
Well, this is really
just saying that we're

1138
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:25,190
all the way over on here, and
we just choose between the two.

1139
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,250
And the defector is the 5 one.

1140
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,390
So this is going to be
a dashed line that's

1141
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,880
going to start from here.

1142
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,530
And then this is 2 and 1/2, 3.

1143
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:37,080

1144
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,435
So this is cooperator starts
here, and defector starts here.

1145
01:01:40,435 --> 01:01:43,390
Do you understand what I'm?

1146
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,290
Now, OK, let's see.

1147
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:48,740
So now this is the one where
if everybody else is defecting,

1148
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,250
well, now, the cooperator
line goes to what?

1149
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,160
Verbally, three, two, one.

1150
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:54,740
AUDIENCE: 0.

1151
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,900
PROFESSOR: 0.

1152
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,410
The defector line goes to 1.

1153
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:09,310

1154
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,640
OK, that line, I started
going the wrong direction,

1155
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,370
but that's supposed
to be a line.

1156
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,940

1157
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,020
So this is an
example of what this

1158
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,914
looks like for the
Prisoner's Dilemma.

1159
01:02:20,914 --> 01:02:22,580
And what you see is
the defector fitness

1160
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,180
is always above the
cooperator fitness.

1161
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,502
So for any population
composition,

1162
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:29,460
defectors have higher
fitness than cooperators.

1163
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,630
So evolution brings you to
the pure defecting state,

1164
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,170
where you have fitness 1.

1165
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:40,001

1166
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:41,500
And if you want,
you could calculate

1167
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,230
what the mean fitness of the
population is, for example.

1168
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,400
And the mean fitness
starts out over here,

1169
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,830
and ends up over here.

1170
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,930
So the mean fitness
decreases over time.

1171
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,610

1172
01:02:54,610 --> 01:03:01,240
Now, you can imagine that in
the simple, two-player models,

1173
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,590
all these are lines.

1174
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:04,970
But you can imagine that the
only thing that's important

1175
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:09,340
are how these lines
cross each other.

1176
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,090
So for example, there are
only a few different things

1177
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,160
that can happen.

1178
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:24,260
You can have one
strategy that dominates,

1179
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,660
which is what occurred here.

1180
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,240
And surprisingly,
that does not mean

1181
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,290
that that strategy
is higher fitness,

1182
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:36,070
in the sense that you may evolve
to a state of low fitness.

1183
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,166
That's what's weird.

1184
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:43,930
You can have coexistence, or
you can have bi-stability.

1185
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:48,880

1186
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,175
So I'll give you
another example of this.

1187
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:59,420

1188
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,990
So now we're just going
to have two strategies.

1189
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:07,516
The strategies-- we'll
just call them A and B.

1190
01:04:07,516 --> 01:04:11,460

1191
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,045
And the question is, what
is the Nash equilibrium?

1192
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:22,620

1193
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:34,500
Is it A, B, or C should
be neither, D is both.

1194
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,950
Do you understand?

1195
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,950
I'm going to ask, because
if this is the game

1196
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,670
and this is the interaction,
is the Nash equilibrium A,

1197
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,400
Nash equilibrium B?

1198
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,240
If you vote C, it means
neither, D means both.

1199
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,590
Do you understand the question?

1200
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,474
I'll give you 30 seconds
to think about it.

1201
01:04:53,474 --> 01:05:38,660

1202
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:44,670
All right, are we ready to vote?

1203
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:47,935
Ready, three, two, one.

1204
01:05:47,935 --> 01:05:53,621

1205
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,370
All right, so we have
a fair distribution.

1206
01:05:55,370 --> 01:06:01,250
I may not have us vote,
but yeah, in this case,

1207
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,970
they're actually
both Nash equilibria.

1208
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,500
So let's see this.

1209
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,290
If both individuals, or
an entire population,

1210
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,000
say, is playing A,
they're getting fitness 5.

1211
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,790
Question is, as a
lone individual,

1212
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,720
you can choose to switch
over and get fitness 3.

1213
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,610
Do you want to do that?

1214
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,150
No.

1215
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,510
So that means that A is going
to be a Nash equilibrium.

1216
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,010
Incidentally, the
difference between

1217
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,780
the so-called regular Nash
equilibrium and the strict Nash

1218
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,050
equilibrium is that
Nash equilibrium

1219
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:35,630
means that no individual has the
incentive to change strategy.

1220
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:40,860
A strict Nash equilibrium means
that any change in strategy

1221
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,800
leads to an actual
decrease in fitness.

1222
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,920
So it's a question of whether
you can make neutral changes

1223
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,690
in strategy or not.

1224
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:48,440
Do you understand?

1225
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,800

1226
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,540
So A is a Nash equilibrium.

1227
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,570
What about B?

1228
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,530
Well, in that case, everybody's
getting to fitness 1.

1229
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:02,980
Now, as a lone individual,
what can you do?

1230
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,850
All you can do is switch.

1231
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,050
As an individual, you
can only choose rows.

1232
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,260
So you go up to 0.

1233
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,950
That's a decrease of fitness.

1234
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:14,530
So that means that strategy
B is also a Nash equilibrium.

1235
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,410

1236
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,450
So there are two Nash
equilibria in this game.

1237
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,850
And what does that
mean about which regime

1238
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:25,830
you're in here, if you convert
this into an evolutionary game

1239
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,075
theory scenario?

1240
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:37,460

1241
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:41,700
Ready, three, two, one.

1242
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,550
OK, so a majority is saying yes.

1243
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:47,130
This is indeed a situation in
which you have bi-stability.

1244
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:50,030

1245
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:53,417
So what does that mean in terms
of these lines if we draw them?

1246
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:57,730

1247
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:07,130
So this is payout as a
function of the fraction that

1248
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,555
is playing the A strategy.

1249
01:08:08,555 --> 01:08:12,000

1250
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,100
Should the lines cross?

1251
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,620
Yes or no?

1252
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,997
Ready, three, two, one.

1253
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:16,580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1254
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:20,898
PROFESSOR: Yes, and
indeed, in principle,

1255
01:08:20,898 --> 01:08:22,689
the math that we do in
all these situations

1256
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:25,319
is kind of super simple.

1257
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:28,540
Yet it's easy to get confused
about what's going on

1258
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,770
in all these situations.

1259
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,930
So the idea here is that if
the population is A, that

1260
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:37,044
means that the A here is at 5.

1261
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:41,390

1262
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:42,694
But then it goes down to 0.

1263
01:08:42,694 --> 01:08:47,140

1264
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:50,448
Whereas over here, B here is 3.

1265
01:08:50,448 --> 01:08:51,364
And then it goes to 1.

1266
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:59,200

1267
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,960
Because these two
lines cross, does that

1268
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,970
mean that you have bi-stability?

1269
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:10,278
Ready, yes or no,
three, two, one,

1270
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:10,819
AUDIENCE: No.

1271
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,780
PROFESSOR: No, and why not?

1272
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1273
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,120
PROFESSOR: That's right,
because you can also

1274
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,411
do the other thing, and then
that leads to coexistence.

1275
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:22,310

1276
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,270
Now, in some ways coexistence
is the most subtle

1277
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,580
of the situations.

1278
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,955
And that's for an
interesting reason.

1279
01:09:30,955 --> 01:09:32,746
AUDIENCE: Sorry, sir,
you said you can also

1280
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:33,537
do the other thing.

1281
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,830
What is the other thing here?

1282
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,398

1283
01:09:37,398 --> 01:09:39,189
PROFESSOR: I'm saying
that these things can

1284
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:42,250
cross in the other orientation.

1285
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:52,734
Let me put a matrix
out there, and then--

1286
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:56,130
so this is something that,
for example, is what's

1287
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,480
known as a Hawk/Dove game.

1288
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,755
Or it has many other names.

1289
01:09:58,755 --> 01:10:12,341

1290
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,840
And we can maybe figure out
what would be the Hawk strategy,

1291
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,048
and what's the Dove strategy.

1292
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:19,710

1293
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:23,080
Now, we want to ask the
same question-- is A a Nash

1294
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,630
equilibrium?

1295
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,480
Is B a Nash equilibrium?

1296
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,440
Is it neither?

1297
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,300
Or is it both?

1298
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,104
And maybe I shouldn't
have covered this up,

1299
01:10:30,104 --> 01:10:32,020
so you're not influenced,
in case you actually

1300
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,290
did do the reading.

1301
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:37,090
Then I don't want to you
to be influenced by this.

1302
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:40,960

1303
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,590
So think about it
for 30 seconds.

1304
01:10:42,590 --> 01:11:09,430

1305
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,047
Do you need more time?

1306
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:12,130
Let's go see where we are.

1307
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:16,650
Ready, three, two, one.

1308
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:19,200
All right, so most of the
group is agreeing in this case,

1309
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,320
neither are the
Nash equilibrium.

1310
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,590

1311
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:29,320
So neither are a
Nash equilibrium.

1312
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,810
Does that mean that this
game has no Nash equilibrium?

1313
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:36,556
Yes or no, verbally--
ready, three, two, one.

1314
01:11:36,556 --> 01:11:37,270
AUDIENCE: No.

1315
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:39,140
PROFESSOR: No, it
does not mean that.

1316
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,920
This game has a
Nash equilibrium.

1317
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,505
And indeed, all games like
this have Nash equilibria.

1318
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:47,200

1319
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,270
And this is what Nash
won the Nobel Prize for,

1320
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:53,660
so this is the famous one-page
paper published in PNAS.

1321
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,500
If you look at it, I have
no idea what it says.

1322
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,510

1323
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:03,930
I mean, he basically
just pointed out

1324
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:07,950
that this theorem implies
this, implies that-- done.

1325
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:14,390
And so it's good that somebody
knew what he was saying,

1326
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,050
otherwise we'd be in
trouble, all of us.

1327
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,760
So what he proved
is that such games,

1328
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:26,050
even with more players,
more options, and so forth,

1329
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,860
they always have such a
solution in this sense.

1330
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,870
There exists some strategy
such as if everybody

1331
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,870
were playing in, nobody
would have the incentive

1332
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,290
to change strategy.

1333
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:39,330
But you have to include
so-called probabilistic or

1334
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:40,180
mixed strategies.

1335
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:46,400

1336
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,350
And we can draw
what this thing is.

1337
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:53,590
So just like always, so
everyone else is following A,

1338
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:55,045
then A starts here at 3.

1339
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:58,170

1340
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,660
And then it goes to 1.

1341
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:04,010

1342
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:07,830
Whereas the B individuals
start at 5, and they go to 0.

1343
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:14,220

1344
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,530
So this looks very
similar to that,

1345
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,720
but they're rather
different, in the sense

1346
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:26,120
that in this situation,
we had bi-stability.

1347
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,410
So if you look at the
direction of evolution,

1348
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,970
depending upon
where you start, you

1349
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:36,330
go to either all B
or all A. Whereas

1350
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:41,210
in this situation over
here, we have coexistence.

1351
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,840
Does not matter where you start.

1352
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,940
So long as you have some
members of both A and B

1353
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:47,810
in the population, you'll always
evolve to the same equilibrium.

1354
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:50,860
Now, the important thing
here that's, I think,

1355
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,220
interesting is that
in a population,

1356
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,430
if you have genetic A's and
genetic B's that are each

1357
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:00,840
giving birth to
their own type, then

1358
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,020
you evolve to some
coexistence of genotypes.

1359
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,020
So here, this is some fraction.

1360
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:17,677
f a star is the equilibrium
fraction, fraction

1361
01:14:17,677 --> 01:14:18,635
of A in the population.

1362
01:14:18,635 --> 01:14:21,240

1363
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,320
So this is a case where you
have genetic diversity that

1364
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,590
leads to phenotypic
diversity in the population.

1365
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:34,430
Whereas the mixed Nash
equilibrium-- this

1366
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:37,560
is a situation where
you have, in principle,

1367
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,020
genetic homogeneity.

1368
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:48,849
So this is a single genotype
that is implementing

1369
01:14:48,849 --> 01:14:49,890
phenotypic heterogeneity.

1370
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:58,174

1371
01:14:58,174 --> 01:14:59,840
And indeed, one of
the things that we've

1372
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,860
been excited about
exploring in my group

1373
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:09,160
is this distinction here, where
it's known that in many cases,

1374
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,360
isogenic populations
of microbes can exhibit

1375
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,100
a diversity of phenotypes
as a result of, for example,

1376
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,555
stochastic gene expression
and bi-stability.

1377
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:21,150

1378
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,230
So that's a molecular
mechanism for how

1379
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,400
you might get heterogeneity.

1380
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,280
Another question is, what
is the evolution explanation

1381
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,140
for why that behavior
might have evolved?

1382
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,820
Now in general, we cannot
prove why something evolved,

1383
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,390
but we can make educated
guesses that make experimentally

1384
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,684
testable hypotheses.

1385
01:15:38,684 --> 01:15:40,100
And for example,
in the experiment

1386
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:44,360
that we've been doing, we've
been looking at bi-modality

1387
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,230
in expression of the
galactose genes in yeast.

1388
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:53,815
And that was still a
problem set in early-- oh,

1389
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,700
no, we removed
that one this year.

1390
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:02,880
Well, so experimentally
yeast, in some environments,

1391
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,840
bimodally or
stochastically activate

1392
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,470
the genes required to break
down the sugar galactose.

1393
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,600
And what we've
demonstrated is that if you

1394
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,590
make the mutants that always
turn on or always don't

1395
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:16,160
turn on these genes, then
they're actually playing game

1396
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:20,050
where you actually get
this exact thing-- where

1397
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,640
you get evolution towards
coexistence of those two

1398
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,740
strategies.

1399
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,070
So that's saying that
maybe the wild type that

1400
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:29,270
follows this stochastic,
mixed strategy-- it

1401
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:32,210
may be implementing the
solution of some game that

1402
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:34,640
is a result of such
frequency dependence.

1403
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,720
There are other possible
explanations to this.

1404
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,760
In the coming weeks,
we'll talk about this idea

1405
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,801
of bet hedging-- that given
uncertain or fluctuating

1406
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,300
environments, it
may be advantageous

1407
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,520
for clonal populations to have a
variety of different strategies

1408
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,890
to cope with that uncertainty.

1409
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:50,225
So we'll talk about
those models later.

1410
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:52,350
But since we're talking
about mixed strategies now,

1411
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:53,647
I wanted to mention that.

1412
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:54,810
Yeah.

1413
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,658
AUDIENCE: So f a
star, just to be sure,

1414
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:59,440
is going to converge to this
probability [INAUDIBLE]?

1415
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,380
PROFESSOR: Exactly, so the
Nash equilibrium mixed strategy

1416
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,680
plays A with probability--
so it's p should

1417
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,020
be equal to f a star.

1418
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,260

1419
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,710
Exactly, so indeed,
the heterogeneity there

1420
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,980
can be implemented either way.

1421
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,516
It's either coexistence
of genotypes following

1422
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:23,890
different strategies,
or it could

1423
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,587
be one genotype
implementing both,

1424
01:17:25,587 --> 01:17:27,420
or it could be a mixture
of those, actually.

1425
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,670
Indeed, a characteristic
of these situations

1426
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:38,070
is that, let's say that you have
a genotype-- a population has

1427
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,810
this genotype that is
implementing the mixed Nash

1428
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:44,680
equilibrium choosing strategy
A with probability p.

1429
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,400
That's that
equilibrium fraction.

1430
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,530
What's interesting is
that any individual

1431
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:54,850
in the population following any
strategy has the same fitness.

1432
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:58,280
And of course, that's kind of
why this was in equilibrium.

1433
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,295
This equilibrium is when the two
strategies have equal fitness.

1434
01:18:01,295 --> 01:18:02,920
But the funny thing
is, what that means

1435
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,137
is, it doesn't matter what
you do at the equilibrium.

1436
01:18:05,137 --> 01:18:06,970
Depending on how you
look at it, it's either

1437
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:09,030
super deep or super trivial.

1438
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,630
But it's a weird thing that
if your at the equilibrium,

1439
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,520
or if the population
or the opponent

1440
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,942
is playing this Nash
equilibrium in these games,

1441
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,650
then it just does not
matter what you do.

1442
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:21,920
You can do A. You can do B,
actually, in any fraction.

1443
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,810
So since A and B have
the same fitness,

1444
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,480
you can choose between them
at any frequency you want,

1445
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,270
and you have the same fitness,
if the rest of the population

1446
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:33,330
is playing this mixed
Nash equilibrium.

1447
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:37,490
And indeed, in this
there are nice conditions

1448
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:42,070
for what makes it
this Nash equilibrium.

1449
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:46,770
And I'm going to just highlight
that you should make sense

1450
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,910
of why it means what it is.

1451
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:54,690
So if the payout, the
expected fitness or payout--

1452
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,820
if you're following
the Nash equilibrium

1453
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:03,890
against Nash equilibrium--
is equal to this guy.

1454
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:07,230
So that's what I
just said-- that it

1455
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,700
doesn't matter what you do.

1456
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,490
If everyone else
is doing p star,

1457
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:14,370
you have the same fitness.

1458
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,360
So that's saying it's
a Nash equilibrium.

1459
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,430

1460
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,980
Whereas there's another
interesting kind of statement

1461
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,010
here, that--

1462
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1463
01:19:27,435 --> 01:19:30,587
That you can't unilaterally
increase your fitness

1464
01:19:30,587 --> 01:19:32,770
by switching.

1465
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,900
PROFESSOR: Right, it's
an equality, which

1466
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,250
means it is a Nash equilibrium.

1467
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,599
Because it's saying that
you don't have the incentive

1468
01:19:38,599 --> 01:19:39,390
to change strategy.

1469
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:42,080
It's true that you're
not dis-incentivized.

1470
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,810
So it's a Nash equilibrium.

1471
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:45,914
It's not a strict
Nash equilibrium.

1472
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:46,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1473
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:50,754

1474
01:19:50,754 --> 01:19:52,920
PROFESSOR: Well, it has to
be greater than/equal to,

1475
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,084
and it's actually equal to.

1476
01:19:55,084 --> 01:19:57,250
The condition it has to be
greater than or equal to,

1477
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,239
but it's equal to, which means
it is a Nash equilibrium.

1478
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,017
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Nash
equilibrium for that situation,

1479
01:20:03,017 --> 01:20:04,410
[INAUDIBLE] strategy.

1480
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:04,710
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1481
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,293
So this is not the
definition of that.

1482
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:08,070
But this thing is
true, which means

1483
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,278
that it's a Nash equilibrium.

1484
01:20:09,278 --> 01:20:12,500

1485
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:18,690
And this other thing that's
interesting is that--

1486
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:21,690
so this tells us that it's
actually one of these ESS's.

1487
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:28,340
And if you have questions about
this, I'm happy to answer it.

1488
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,640
It's explained in
the book as well.

1489
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,700
We are out of time, so
I should let you go.

1490
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,645
But good luck on the
exam next Thursday.

1491
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,770
If you have questions and
you want to meet with me,

1492
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,811
I'm available on Tuesday.

1493
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:40,940
So please let me know.
