00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:21,320

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,850
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to take

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,270
a little bit of a lightning
tour through some basic topics

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:34,060
on chemical enzyme kinetics,
before thinking a little bit

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,110
about some, what you might
call, simple input-output

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,814
relationships, in terms
of gene expression.

15
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:42,230
I've got separation
of time scale,

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,910
and also this basic notion
that for a stable protein

17
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,809
there's a natural
time scale over which

18
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,350
the concentration
will go up or down,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,640
and that's dictated by
the cell generation time.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,450

21
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,610
At the end, we'll then talk
about different ways you get

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,800
this thing of ultrasensitivity.

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,080
So, how is it that
you can make it

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,090
so that a small change in
the input concentration,

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,090
say the concentration of
a transcription factor,

26
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,010
might be able to lead to a
large change in the output,

27
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,930
or the gene expression
of its target?

28
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,620
We'll talk about
how you can have,

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,760
for example, cooperative
binding at the promoter,

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,520
or you can have multimerization,
kind of leads to similar things

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,200
here.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,420
But also, we're going
to talk about this idea

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,860
of molecular titration.

34
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,980
So if you have another protein
that acts as kind of a sponge,

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,780
then this connect can
lead to a similar effect.

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,450
And this is indeed observed
in various natural contexts.

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:43,010
So this is motivated by a work
by Nick Buchler, B-U-C-H-L-E-R.

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,680
Turns out I was down
at Princeton, no sorry,

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,920
I was out at Duke yesterday, and
so I got to hang out with Nick

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,580
and talk about this work.

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,669
I had previously told him
that in my first lecture

42
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,210
in the systems
biology class, we like

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,440
to discuss this molecular
titration effect.

44
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,880
He was instrumental in
elucidating how it worked.

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,910
All right so let's go
ahead and get started.

46
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,904
So hopefully you all
have these cards.

47
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:14,070
We're going to start out
with some simple questions,

48
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,610
just to make sure
that you know how

49
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,040
to use the complicated
devices that

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
are sitting in front of you.

51
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,819
OK?

52
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,630

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,250
So what we want
to do is to start

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,360
by thinking about a situation
where you have two molecules.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,300
We're going to
call them E and S,

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,620
and of course, you can imagine
what these might possibly stand

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,140
for in one context or another.

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,840
There are two rates
here that are describing

59
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,140
the rate that these molecules,
E and S, find each other, Kf.

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,780
And Kr is defining the rate
at which this complex is

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,390
going to fall apart.

62
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,820
So there's this
forward rate that

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,870
is sum Kf, times
concentration of E,

64
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,350
times the
concentration of S. Now

65
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,640
I'd say for the first
part of this lecture,

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,360
we will indeed use the chemistry
convention of concentrations

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,680
here, although we will quickly
get tired of these brackets

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,930
and we'll just start
writing the letters.

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,397
And hopefully it is self
evident in the context

70
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,230
that I'm referring to
a concentration rather

71
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,980
than something else, but if
you're ever confused, please

72
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,440
ask.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,630
So this is forward rate,
and then the reverse rate

74
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,890
is something similar.

75
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,024
So we have this Kr.

76
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,440
Now this is just
the concentration

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,490
of the complex ES.

78
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,270

79
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,360
Many of you have spent
a lot of time thinking

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,770
about how we often
define things.

81
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,670
This Kd, dissociation
constant, is defined

82
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,760
as the ratio Kr over Kf.

83
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,780

84
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,682
Now, just so we can practice
using our cards, what

85
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:03,615
we're going to ask first is what
the units of this Kd thing is.

86
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:06,530

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,260
Now, in general, when
I ask such a question,

88
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,875
I will give you some
A, B, C, D options.

89
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,242

90
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,200
You can start thinking
even before I write down

91
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,839
the options.

92
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,630
Yes?

93
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,130
I'll encourage you
to think before I

94
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,255
start writing down options.

95
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:25,670

96
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:34,070
So it's either dimensionless,
units of concentration,

97
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,790
1 over concentration,
1 over time,

98
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,740
and I will often include at
the bottom something that

99
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,080
simply is, don't know.

100
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,744
And that is if you're
really confused

101
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:50,160
about what I'm
talking about, then

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,430
feel free to just flash me
that, and that at least tells me

103
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,480
that I'm gibbering nonsense.

104
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,440
So there's going to be a
very strict set of rules

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,620
for how we do these
flash cards, all right?

106
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,400
You don't get to vote
before I tell you to vote.

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,226
You have to keep on thinking.

108
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,850
If you think you know
the right answer,

109
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,460
check limits, just do whatever
it is to keep on thinking.

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,630
And then we vote simultaneously.

111
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,240
That way, it builds up the
tension, everyone gets excited,

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
and then you vote.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,312
It also provides
me an opportunity

114
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,770
to make sure that I can see
that everybody's participating.

115
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,210
So if you don't vote, then
you have the opportunity

116
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,190
to tell the group what you think
the answer should be and why.

117
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,860

118
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,010
And the cards
they're both colored,

119
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,190
and they have letters on there,
so the letters correspond

120
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,689
to the answer.

121
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:46,730
We're all on top of this?

122
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,799

123
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,090
Have you had a chance to think?

124
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,831
Or has my talking bothered you?

125
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:55,330
Both.

126
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,490
OK.

127
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,980
So what we do is I'm going to
ask, do you need more time?

128
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,680
If you need more time, just
nod or something like that,

129
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,690
and if more than a few people
nod, I'll give you more time.

130
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,580
But you guys are
totally all right.

131
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,390
OK let's see how we are.

132
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,650
So then I'll say,
OK, we're ready.

133
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,060
And then we're going to go
three, two, one, and then

134
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,860
I want a vote by your chest.

135
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,250
You don't need to
display it to the group.

136
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,542
It's just here, and then
tell me what you think.

137
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:24,250
All right, ready.

138
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,210
Three, two, one.

139
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,540

140
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,870
Broadly, people know
how to use the cards.

141
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,650
And there's a clear
majority of the group,

142
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,414
although it's not 100%, that
are saying that this thing is

143
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:39,080
a concentration.

144
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,420

145
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,730
I'd say that if the group
is maybe between 25,

146
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,930
75% correct on these
sorts of things,

147
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,330
then I will often have you
pair off in, well, in pairs.

148
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,050
And the goal there
would be to try

149
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,883
to convince your neighbor
that you're right.

150
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,680
In this case we're
a bit above 75%,

151
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,700
so I've already indicated
what the answer is.

152
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,800
Can somebody just quickly say,
why is this a concentration?

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Maybe in the back.

154
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,963
AUDIENCE: So, we know
that both rates need

155
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:14,270
to have the same dimensions--

156
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,769
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and what are
the dimensions of these rates?

157
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

158
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,230
PROFESSOR: OK.

159
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,320
So, there are actually different
conventions, in principle,

160
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,960
but we will often be
working in numbers

161
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,654
in most of this
class, in which case

162
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,320
it would actually
just be a 1 over time.

163
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,670
But depending on whether
you're doing chemistry-- So

164
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,100
the numerators may be
ambiguous, depending,

165
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,280
but the important thing is that
they're definitely the same.

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,140
These are definitely
going to be the same.

167
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,514
But it is true that in an
awful lot of this class,

168
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:52,180
we're going to be
thinking about numbers

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,140
rather than the concentrations.

170
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,681
Because, for a lot
of the class we'll

171
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,930
be thinking about finite
number fluctuations

172
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,020
of stochastic dynamics, in which
case, concentration, who knows

173
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,420
what's going to happen?

174
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,730
But these have to have
the same units, right?

175
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,270
And the important thing here
is if you look at the right,

176
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,720
you see this guy has an
extra concentration up here.

177
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,690
So, I think this is, on the
one hand, a trivial point,

178
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,097
but it's just really
easy to forget about

179
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:21,930
as you move forward.

180
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,640
Because these things, they
look awfully similar, right?

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,430
There's a K, little
subscript something, right?

182
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,620
So just be careful about
this kind of thing.

183
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,929

184
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,419
Are there any questions
about what I've said so far?

185
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,610
So in these cases.

186
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,640
I think that it's
really very useful

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,890
to try to get some intuition
for what's going on.

188
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,820
These are all just
definitions, but you

189
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,861
want to ask, well, what
happens if concentrations

190
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,415
of various things move around?

191
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:52,840
What we want to think
about is just the fraction.

192
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,420
And the reason we call this
E is because, for now, we

193
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:03,550
might be calling this an enzyme
and, over here, a substrate,

194
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,370
something that the
enzyme is acting on.

195
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,499
But we'll see that,
in many cases,

196
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,540
we might be thinking about
one of these as being,

197
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,319
let's say, the piece
of DNA, and then

198
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,610
this is not even the substrate.

199
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,885
Then maybe this is the
RNA polymerase that

200
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,010
will lead to transcription.

201
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,560
So in various contexts, we'll
think about these things having

202
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,510
different molecular identities.

203
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,360
But for now, E and S,
possibly enzyme substrate.

204
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,520
So the question is, if
for now we just think,

205
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,620
these are just two
molecules of whatever sort,

206
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,070
at some concentration, and
we just want to make sure

207
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,040
that we are on top
of what's going

208
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,000
to happen if the
concentrations of each

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,390
of these molecular
components goes

210
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,830
either to 0 or to infinity.

211
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,170
I think that before you
do any math in life,

212
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,510
it's good to just think
about these sorts of limits,

213
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,690
because it helps to make sure
that your intuition is correct.

214
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,972
In many, many cases, if
you think about the problem

215
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,180
before you do any math, then
when you go do the math,

216
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,221
you'll get some solution.

217
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,330
You can check to see
whether your solution is

218
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,665
consistent with what
your intuition said.

219
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,040
And if they disagree
it means you

220
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,290
have to update either your
intuition, or the solution,

221
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,610
or maybe both.

222
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,110
It's possible.

223
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,130
But at least one of
them has to be updated,

224
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,830
and that's a way of both getting
better scores on your exams,

225
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,660
but also improving your
scientific intuition.

226
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,810
So, in particular, we just
want to do some limits.

227
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,840

228
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
We'll think in the
context, for example,

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
if the total concentration--
your adding of the small S--

230
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,150
if it goes to zero,
what we're going

231
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,570
to try to get intuition about
is this fraction of E-bound.

232
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,590
It might be the enzyme.

233
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,160
So the fraction of
this thing bound,

234
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,260
it's defined by the
concentration of the complex,

235
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,290
divided by the
concentration of the enzyme,

236
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,490
plus the concentration of
the enzyme in the complex,

237
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,360
assuming that this is the only
two places that the enzyme can

238
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,310
be located.

239
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:09,890
Now, these three arrows, that,
in general, means a definition.

240
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,070
So the question is,
if we come here,

241
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,090
what happens to the fraction
of this enzyme that's bound?

242
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:34,180
And, again, can't be
determined-- which

243
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,650
is different from don't know.

244
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,729

245
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:42,770
And we're going to just
do a few different limits

246
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,430
so we want to maybe go
through these quickly.

247
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,990
I'll give you 10 seconds
to prepare your card.

248
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:58,460

249
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,500
All right, ready?

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,315
Three, two, one.

251
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:04,260

252
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,300
So we're pretty good.

253
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,570
So I'd say a majority,
at least, of the group

254
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,630
is saying that in this case, the
fraction bound should go to 0.

255
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,974
Intuitively, why should that be?

256
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

257
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,662
PROFESSOR: A little louder.

258
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:25,120
AUDIENCE: You have
nothing to bind.

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,078
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

260
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,120
So if there's no
S around at all,

261
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,130
then you shouldn't have
much of this complex, right?

262
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,220
But you still have some enzymes.

263
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,750
This thing should go to 0,
and that kind of makes sense.

264
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:46,470
And, similarly, if you add a
lot, a lot of this substrate?

265
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,478
I'll give you eight seconds.

266
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,160
AUDIENCE: So, you're moving
the substrate [INAUDIBLE].

267
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,900
PROFESSOR: Yes, so S
total, this is the total.

268
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,800
This is if you have
a test tube, and this

269
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,040
is the amount of this sugar
that you add in there.

270
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,170
So S total, then, is
the sum of that and S.

271
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,450
Do you need more time?

272
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:12,950
Ready.

273
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,640
Three, two, one.

274
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,760
So we have maybe an island
of people that disagree.

275
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,370

276
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,070
At least a majority are
saying, in this case,

277
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,120
it should have to go to 1.

278
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,454
Of course, this is
a limit and a limit.

279
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:37,870
It's always going to be between
0 and 1, but in the limit,

280
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,890
it does go to 1.

281
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,560
So if you just add so
much of the substrate

282
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,240
then you should be able
to saturate that binding

283
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,210
and drive all of that
enzyme into the bound state.

284
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,900

285
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,460
So this one is actually, maybe,
a little bit more subtle.

286
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:02,627
So what if we take this limit?

287
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm going to give you 20
seconds to think about it, just

288
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,446
because it's roughly three
times as hard as the last one.

289
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:34,454

290
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:35,370
Do you need more time?

291
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,660
Or do you think that you have
something you believe in,

292
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,493
that you're willing to
turn to your neighbor

293
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,990
and-- Let's see where we are.

294
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,840
Ready.

295
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,445
Three, two, one.

296
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,426

297
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:48,550
All right, so this is good.

298
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,170
So we have a fair
distribution, and this is one

299
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,970
that reasonable people might
be able to argue about.

300
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,890
It's worth having the argument.

301
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,040
Give yourself 30 seconds,
turn your neighbor,

302
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
preferably a neighbor
that disagrees with you,

303
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,780
and tell them why you
said what you said.

304
00:15:07,780 --> 00:16:08,890

305
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,640
If in a pair, you've
already convinced

306
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,890
each other of something,
then go ahead and look around

307
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,000
to see if there's another
pair that has maybe

308
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,380
settled on a different answer.

309
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:43,990

310
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,380
I think that you guys are still
kind of passionately arguing,

311
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,800
but maybe we'll go
ahead and convene,

312
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,379
and try to get a sense of--
I think, from the sound of it

313
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,420
at least, there's some
disagreement about the way

314
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,390
to think about this.

315
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,890
In general, if you
want to volunteer

316
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,780
an opinion or an explanation,
what I like to do is,

317
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,440
I like to tell the group
what your neighbor thought.

318
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,276
So go ahead, anybody, it
could be a neighbor in quotes.

319
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:15,359
Anybody want to volunteer
one possible explanation

320
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,109
of how to think about this?

321
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,109
AUDIENCE: Well, what
my neighbors thought

322
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:27,440
was if E total is
defined as E plus ES,

323
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,450
then as E total goes to 0,
then this goes to 0 over 0

324
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,930
at some vague, unclear--

325
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
although, right.

326
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,750
So you're saying, maybe
it's all going to 0,

327
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,580
and then this is
just philosophy.

328
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,984

329
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:48,150
Not that I'm putting words
in your neighbor's mouth.

330
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,040

331
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,885
So there's a sense in which this
is true, but mathematically,

332
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:59,630
and actually also physically,
there are well-defined ways

333
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,430
of taking such a limit, right?

334
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,350
So if you get 0 over 0, then
you can use L'Hopital's Rule,

335
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,840
which we'll have the
opportunity to pull out sometime

336
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,710
within the class.

337
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,395
Of course, the most difficult
part of L'Hopital's Rule

338
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,760
is knowing how to spell it.

339
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:21,214

340
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,130
So that's one answer,
the mathematical answer,

341
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,860
that you should be able to just
take this limit and so forth.

342
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,110
But I think there is another
physical answer, which is

343
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,870
that this could happen, right?

344
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,206
And something is
going to occur, right?

345
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,580
You could, in
principle, measure.

346
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,980
And even if you just had
a single enzyme there,

347
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,170
this Fb would be the fraction of
time that that enzyme is bound.

348
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,820
So this is a well-defined
experimental question

349
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,430
and the answer should arise
from these interactions.

350
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,150

351
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,290
But then how do we edit
it-- what does it all mean?

352
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,850
How do we figure out the answer?

353
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,930
What's another
possible view on this?

354
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,242
Maybe in the back.

355
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:09,700
AUDIENCE: My neighbor
thought that,

356
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,694
if there's a non-zero
concentration of S,

357
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,480
and the concentration
of E goes to 0,

358
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,047
then all E will be bound
[? at some point ?].

359
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,630
PROFESSOR: This is
interesting, right?

360
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,800
So, if there's a finite
concentration of S,

361
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,870
if E goes to 0, then
you say well there's

362
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,934
plenty of S to go around, so
I should always get bound.

363
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:35,326
Is that what the neighbor--
that's another option.

364
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:36,700
So, so far, we've
had an argument

365
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,630
for can't be determined,
it's philosophy.

366
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,800
We've had an argument for 1.

367
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,870
Other possibilities?

368
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,694
This is an interesting
question, because depending

369
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:51,860
on how you think about it,
you can convince yourself

370
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,670
that it's anything, right?

371
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,726
Other possible answers?

372
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:59,270

373
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,695
No.

374
00:20:00,695 --> 00:20:02,595
AUDIENCE: So, I don't
hear the good answer.

375
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,868

376
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:10,206
I said E because, when
there isn't very much E,

377
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:19,035
then it's true that a lot of
people go into yes, but yeah.

378
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,520
I don't know what to say.

379
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,490

380
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,870
PROFESSOR: Now, that's OK.

381
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,312
Another take on that
answer, or a different one?

382
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,270
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

383
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,644
If I had to complete
that answer,

384
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,210
maybe something like,
but there still might not

385
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,480
be a total large
concentration of either,

386
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,736
so there might still be
a decent chance for E

387
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:41,434
to be around for a while
without encountering some of S.

388
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,100
AUDIENCE 2: So the
forward reaction rate

389
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
will also go to 0.

390
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,650
Even though S is very large,
the forward reaction rate

391
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,290
will also go to 0, as the
concentration [INAUDIBLE].

392
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,940
PROFESSOR: By the
forward rate, it's

393
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,481
not necessarily a
variable. it's just

394
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,197
that it depends on the substrate
concentration in this case.

395
00:20:56,197 --> 00:21:00,830

396
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,765
Other takes on it?

397
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:07,060

398
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,810
This is interesting.

399
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,750
So I'm going to argue that the
most reasonable way to view

400
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,970
this would give you--
as long as there

401
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,620
is some finite concentration
of that substrate around,

402
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,840
and I think that there's a very
well-defined sense in which

403
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,170
it's going to go to
some finite fraction.

404
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,990
And I think that when
you're thinking about this

405
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,250
in the context of molecular
kinetics, the chemistry of you,

406
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,660
it still is all
well-defined, but the way

407
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,130
that I think that I get the
most clear intuition is just

408
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,480
to imagine myself as being that
one and only enzyme in the test

409
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,870
tube.

410
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,600
Now there's going to
be some rate that I

411
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,000
bind to the substrates, right?

412
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,910
And what's going to
determine that rate?

413
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,776

414
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,740
AUDIENCE: The concentration
of the substrate?

415
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,781
PROFESSOR: The concentration
of substrate, right.

416
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,690
So if I double the
substrate concentration,

417
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,690
what should that do to
the rate of me binding?

418
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,875
It should double it, yeah.

419
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,250
And then of course
there's always

420
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,700
this Kf somewhere in there,
and some units, right?

421
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,070
But there's going to be
some rate that I bind.

422
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,550
And then when I bind again?

423
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,180
Now I'm just an
enzyme substrate.

424
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,739
Now, instead thinking about
this in the context of chemical

425
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:18,280
kinetics, I can just
think about this

426
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,920
from the standpoint of an
individual molecule, where

427
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm a complex, S-bound,
and there's some rate

428
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,680
that I fall apart.

429
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
And it's just the balance
of those two rates

430
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,050
of finding a substrate
and falling part

431
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,430
that's going to lead
to this fraction bound.

432
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,150

433
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,858
AUDIENCE: Taking what
you just explained,

434
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:41,425
couldn't you think about it
as E always either 0 or 1,

435
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:42,300
because when you're--

436
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,625
PROFESSOR: Yeah

437
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,041
AUDIENCE: --in the case of
having one [? and the same-- ?]

438
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

439
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,290
So, if you'd like, we could
put an average sign here,

440
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,821
to say an average over time.

441
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,320
Because in many, many cases,
what we're really interested in

442
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,872
is the fraction of time that,
say, the promoter is bound,

443
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,330
or the enzyme is
bound, or whatnot.

444
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,550
And if you have many,
many, many molecules, then

445
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,911
at any moment in time, the
average is the time average.

446
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,660
But once you're down
to a single molecule,

447
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,493
then you really want
to take a time average.

448
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:17,445

449
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:20,967
We'll revisit this in just
a moment using the math,

450
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,300
but what's interesting is the
math also can mislead you.

451
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,680

452
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,890
Other questions?

453
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,582
If somebody wants
to argue forcefully

454
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:34,040
what their neighbor
said was right,

455
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:42,420
then I'm happy to-- we will come
back to this in a little bit.

456
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,910
If I want to do the
fourth possibility, which

457
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,697
is the total concentration
of the enzyme,

458
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:48,905
it's going to go to infinity.

459
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,100

460
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,270
I'll give you, again, eight
seconds to think and then

461
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,860
get your card ready.

462
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:10,450

463
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,380
Are you ready?

464
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,870
Three, two, one.

465
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,461

466
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:16,960
OK.

467
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,100
So we actually have a fair
amount of disagreement,

468
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,260
between As and Bs it seems.

469
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,890
Go ahead and, again,
turn to your neighbor,

470
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,760
but maybe find somebody
that disagrees with you.

471
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,565
Sometimes there are
pockets of people that

472
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:34,690
agree one way or the other.

473
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,140
So try to find each other.

474
00:24:38,140 --> 00:25:10,560

475
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,570
Yeah, I know.

476
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,162
I understand.

477
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:14,740

478
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,280
You can try to figure out the
expression for the fraction

479
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,409
bound, and how that behaves.

480
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:25,534
And that's actually kind
of weird as well, frankly.

481
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:32,450

482
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,707
Why don't we go ahead and
reconvene, just so I can see.

483
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,290
And maybe, let's go
ahead and re-vote,

484
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,870
so I can see if
anybody convinced

485
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,050
anybody of anything else.

486
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,640
Ready.

487
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,570
Three, two, one.

488
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,035
So it seems like now there's
pretty good agreement.

489
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,410
The answer to this
is going to be

490
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,880
A. There were a fair number
of people that said B before.

491
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,724
So here comes our curvy lines.

492
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:57,830

493
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,890
And so the idea here
is that in the limit

494
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,410
of the enzyme concentration
going to infinity,

495
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,740
in that limit the fraction
bound has to go to 0,

496
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,170
because you just don't
have any substrate to bind.

497
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,016
And even if all the
substrate's bound-- and indeed

498
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,890
in this limit, what
fraction of the substrate

499
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,051
ends up being bound?

500
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,110
AUDIENCE: All of it.

501
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,090
PROFESSOR: All of it, right.

502
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,760
So then, indeed,
the fraction bound

503
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,780
is just going to be
the concentration

504
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,279
of the substrate divided by the
concentration of the enzyme.

505
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,895

506
00:26:27,895 --> 00:26:29,270
In the limit of
the concentration

507
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,353
of the enzyme going to
infinity, then the fraction

508
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:33,470
of the enzyme bound
is going to go to 0.

509
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,550
You're unhappy.

510
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,090
AUDIENCE: I think having made
an extremely eloquent argument,

511
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,560
number 3 for B, I actually
think that that answer is wrong.

512
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,020
PROFESSOR: OK.

513
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,664
So this one, right?

514
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,080
Yes, I mean, you
had convinced me.

515
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,450

516
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,160
AUDIENCE: So if you take
E total to 0 at fixed S--

517
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
PROFESSOR: Fixed S, yes.

518
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,228
AUDIENCE: --then the
reaction rate is--

519
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:04,306

520
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,722
PROFESSOR: You have to take
the limits carefully, I think.

521
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:10,658
AUDIENCE: --is a ratio
of the forward propensity

522
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:12,134
and the backwards propensity.

523
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,894

524
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:15,560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

525
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,242

526
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:20,200
I think that the clearest
way to think about it

527
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,460
is as just that single enzyme.

528
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,632
Because, it's certainly going
to have some rate of binding,

529
00:27:25,632 --> 00:27:27,090
and then once it's
bound it's going

530
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,548
to have some rate
of falling apart.

531
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:30,565

532
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,690
And that ratio is not a
function of whether there's

533
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,230
one enzyme-- I mean, that
ratio is well-defined.

534
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,350

535
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,890
The time average
of the probability

536
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,710
of that enzyme being
bound is, indeed,

537
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,710
a well-defined quantity.

538
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,320

539
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,080
AUDIENCE: So can Ethan say
D and it depends on the Kd?

540
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,270
PROFESSOR: Well, people
always like to argue Ds.

541
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,170

542
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,590
We can write down what the
expression is, actually, now.

543
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,560
And then you can decide whether
you think D is justified.

544
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,310
We can also just
try to figure out,

545
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,250
what's the equilibrium
of this thing?

546
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:14,972
So the change in the
complex concentration

547
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,430
as a function of
time is just going

548
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,020
to be the rate of creation
minus the rate of destruction.

549
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,640
So there's just going
to be this K forward,

550
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:35,470
ES-- oh sorry, these
brackets are awful-- Kr, ES.

551
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,320
And we just want to
set this equal to 0,

552
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,950
if we want to figure out what
the equilibrium there is.

553
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:46,840
And in one line, you can find
that the fraction bound can

554
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,860
be written as a concentration
of the substrate here,

555
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,996
divided by Kd, plus S. Is
this correct from standpoint

556
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:57,495
of units?

557
00:28:57,495 --> 00:29:04,440

558
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,300
So there's something that
you might find troubling

559
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,114
about this expression, though.

560
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:15,650

561
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,090
Is anybody troubled by it?

562
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,850

563
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,317
AUDIENCE: But it equals 0.

564
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,275
PROFESSOR: You could say,
what if E total is 0?

565
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:27,820

566
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,760
I'd say that if E total
is actually zero, now

567
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,430
I think that's an
ill-defined quantity.

568
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,620
So, at some point, I'll side
with the philosophers here.

569
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,160
But if there is an enzyme to
talk about fraction bound,

570
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,840
then-- So it's related
to this, but it's--

571
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,756

572
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:52,032
AUDIENCE: But whenever you
have [INAUDIBLE] E [INAUDIBLE].

573
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:52,740
PROFESSOR: Right.

574
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,730
So we've already discussed
from our intuition

575
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,390
that as E total
goes to infinity,

576
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,260
then the fraction bound
is supposed to go what?

577
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,360
To 0, we decided, right?

578
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,436
And does this
expression do that?

579
00:30:08,436 --> 00:30:10,266
AUDIENCE: Well this
is S, not S total.

580
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:10,890
PROFESSOR: Yes!

581
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,360
So this is S, not S total.

582
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,940
And once again, really
easy to screw this up.

583
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,790
Because, in many contexts, S
and S total are the same thing.

584
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,850
Especially, in context
of enzyme kinetics,

585
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,880
it's often the case that the
concentration enzyme is really

586
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,680
rather low, and then the
substrate concentration

587
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,630
is huge, so then S and
S total we can really

588
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,090
treat as being interchangeable.

589
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,100
But here, in the general
context, we can't.

590
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,210
And this concentration
of S, this thing

591
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,470
is a function of the
concentration of the enzyme.

592
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,590
So this guy here,
it's a function

593
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,100
of the total amount
of substrate you have

594
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,695
and also E total, and
for that matter, Kd.

595
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:06,960

596
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,180
So really this thing
is a true statement,

597
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,337
but it's very misleading
if you're not keeping track

598
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:15,420
of what these things mean.

599
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,594
Because, this thing is very
simple, except for that

600
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:22,010
it's really actually complicated
because S section depends

601
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,720
on everything right?

602
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,220
Now there's one
context in which you

603
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,470
can be safe in assuming that
S and S total are the same,

604
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,540
and that's in the limit of, for
example, E total going to 0.

605
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,080
So if you just have 1
enzyme, then this expression

606
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,400
is, essentially, always valid.

607
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,344
Every now and then,
you might be using up

608
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,260
one of your substrate
molecules, occasionally.

609
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,240
Right?

610
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,050
But it's pretty safe to say
that in the limit of E total

611
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,600
going 0, when it's just in
the limit of one enzyme,

612
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,130
then it's really just
described by a curve that

613
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,110
looks like this.

614
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,220
And this curve is something
that you see over, and over,

615
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,080
and over again.

616
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,720
And this is the
fundamental reason

617
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,020
that Michaelis Menten kinetics
looks the way it does.

618
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,390
But this is going to
be very useful for us

619
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,770
because, in many contexts
that we're interested in,

620
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,810
we want to think
about, for example,

621
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,610
the rate expression
of some gene.

622
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,180
And what we want to know
about is the fraction of time

623
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,890
that it's going to be bound by,
say, a transcription factor.

624
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,530
So then, in the
simplest case, we

625
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,010
get an input-output relationship
that is just given by this.

626
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,120
Because, there's just one,
or few copies, of that DNA,

627
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,740
so it doesn't really sequester
the transcription factor

628
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,990
that's going to be binding it.

629
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,810

630
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,640
Do you guys understand
why this is weird?

631
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
A thing you have
to be careful of?

632
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,040

633
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,770
And more generally,
I strongly recommend

634
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,390
that, in all of these
sorts of problems,

635
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,884
it's good to just
plot some things.

636
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:04,300
For example, the
fraction bound is

637
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,850
a function of if you vary
the substrate concentration.

638
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,420
Because, often you think that
you know what's going on,

639
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,460
and then when you just go and
sit down to draw some curve,

640
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,070
just get your
intuition, you realize

641
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,860
you don't know where it starts,
you don't where it ends,

642
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,630
you don't know what
it does in between.

643
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,010
It's embarrassing,
but it's only when

644
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,301
you sit down and try to do
something like that that you

645
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:26,450
realize that it's not obvious.

646
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,700
So just, for example, it's
useful to imagine a situation,

647
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,280
just between a
similar E and S, where

648
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,390
we, for the sake
of argument, say

649
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,690
that S total is around this Kd.

650
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,380

651
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,460
Now what we want to do is
ask, what's the fraction

652
00:33:47,460 --> 00:34:00,000
bound as a function of E total?

653
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,530
So we're going to
fix total substrate,

654
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,555
vary the enzyme concentration.

655
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:09,270

656
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,770
So we already know what
the limit here should be.

657
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,560
We go to infinity,
what should this go to?

658
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,429

659
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,651
0.

660
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:20,400
We know that eventually
it should go to 0,

661
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,360
and we already figured that
out for any finite substrate

662
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,330
concentration.

663
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,739
Incidentally, on
many of the exams,

664
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:33,210
I will ask for plots
of curves like this.

665
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,940
So basically you
want to indicate

666
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,941
where it goes on one
end, where it starts--

667
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:41,440
and where is it going to start
in the limit of E total going

668
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,239
to 0?

669
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,460
Half.

670
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,489
Then it's actually
accurately described by that.

671
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,250
So we start here.

672
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,210
This is 1.

673
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,199
So we start at 1/2.

674
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,590
And it's going to have to go
in between those two, right?

675
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,480
So what's the characteristic
concentration here

676
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,360
where something-- where
it's changing a lot?

677
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:14,162

678
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:15,107
AUDIENCE: Kd?

679
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:15,940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Kd.

680
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,470
Kd's actually the only
concentration in the problem.

681
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,260
So that means that's
what sets scale.

682
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,340
And I don't know, Kd,
exactly where it should

683
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,680
be, but something in there.

684
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,980
So in these sorts
of situations, you

685
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,910
want to get the limits and
what is it that sets the scale?

686
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,960
If there's a peak,
is where is it?

687
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,390

688
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,639
I encourage for a
few toy examples,

689
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,930
just draw some of these things.

690
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,460
It's a fun way to spend
a Saturday afternoon.

691
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,215
Are there any questions
about what we've said so far?

692
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:49,715
Yes.

693
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:53,352
AUDIENCE: What's the Fb
when E total equals Kd?

694
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,810
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, what

695
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,790
is the fraction of the
enzyme that's bound

696
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,270
when E total is equal to Kd?

697
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,790
I think we could figure it
out, but it might actually

698
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,770
be a little bit of math.

699
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,270
Let me see.

700
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,980

701
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,070
I would have to think
about it, but it's

702
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,070
going to be around a third or
a fifth, somewhere in there.

703
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,117

704
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,950
If somebody gets bored
with what I'm saying,

705
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,590
they can do the calculation
and report to us

706
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,423
at the end of class.

707
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:34,830

708
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:41,120
So what we've just done,
it feels like a lot of time

709
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,000
to spend on two molecules
binding to each other,

710
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,020
but I think that it's
good to just make sure

711
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,629
that you're comfortable with
the simplest kind of process

712
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:50,420
before you start thinking
about things that

713
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,650
are super complicated, for
example, Michaelis Menten

714
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,030
kinetics.

715
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,380
So it's not super complicated.

716
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,260
E plus S. So now it's
the same thing here,

717
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,760
where we have K forward, K
reverse, to this complex.

718
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,290
But here, at some rate,
Kcat, enzyme does something,

719
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,710
turns it into a product.

720
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,410
Now this is a model of
how an enzyme works.

721
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:26,170
It is not a perfect description
of reality in any given case,

722
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,740
or in general.

723
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,560
What's the most obvious
possible point of concern?

724
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,402

725
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:35,860
AUDIENCE: There's
no way to go back

726
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,160
PROFESSOR: No way to go
back, well that's OK.

727
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,368
What's that matter with that?

728
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:39,870
AUDIENCE: Well,
sometimes there is.

729
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,980
PROFESSOR: Well
sometimes there is.

730
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,479
OK.

731
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:44,089

732
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,630
I'd say the problem
is, in some ways,

733
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,691
more fundamental than
just, sometimes there is.

734
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:48,190
Right?

735
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,239

736
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,530
It's true that sometimes--
but sometimes lots of things

737
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,029
happen.

738
00:37:56,029 --> 00:38:01,430
Sometimes the enzyme
binds 2 substrates.

739
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,660
On any specific case,
there are many ways

740
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,050
that this thing can
fail, but there's

741
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,285
a more fundamental sense
which is a problem.

742
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:15,430
AUDIENCE: The rate at which it
produces the-- P doesn't depend

743
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,020
on any other small molecules.

744
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,520
It depends on other
concentrations--

745
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,990
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

746
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,124
So what Sam is saying
is, well this Kcat

747
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:23,540
is not a function
of other things.

748
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,359
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

749
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,400
PROFESSOR: It's true, and
in many cases in might,

750
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:37,200
but there's a real sense in
which this thing is failing

751
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,140
fundamentally for any enzyme.

752
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,848
And I just want to make
sure that we're all--

753
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,560
AUDIENCE: Dissociation of P.

754
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,370
PROFESSOR: Dissociation
of P, and what--

755
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,320
AUDIENCE: From the enzyme.

756
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,500
PROFESSOR: So, you don't
like the dissociation?

757
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,374
AUDIENCE: We don't have
an association there.

758
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,248
You're assuming that
the Kf of disocciation--

759
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,940
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

760
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,690
Although, I could argue, Kcat
is some kind of bulk parameter

761
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,340
that tells you about the
rate of breaking some bond

762
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,570
and dissociating.

763
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,150
And it's just a simple model.

764
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,595
We don't want to
ask too much of it.

765
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:14,554

766
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,842
AUDIENCE: K reverse is huge.

767
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,050
PROFESSOR: K reverse is huge?

768
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,841
Well, I haven't told
you what K reverse is.

769
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:23,100
So, it's not huge.

770
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,020
I mean, it could be.

771
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,061
So far we haven't said
anything about what it is.

772
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,230

773
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,540
What are the fundamental
properties of an enzyme?

774
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,220
Or a catalyst, for that matter?

775
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,570

776
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,460
When you go home
for Thanksgiving,

777
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,030
your grandmother asks
you, honey, tell me,

778
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,094
what's a catalyst?

779
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,260
AUDIENCE: It's doesn't get
used during the reaction.

780
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,710
PROFESSOR: What's that?

781
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,310
AUDIENCE: It doesn't get
used up during the reaction.

782
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,393
PROFESSOR: It doesn't get
used up in the reaction.

783
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:55,110
OK, perfect, not used up.

784
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,084
And does this
model violate that?

785
00:39:58,084 --> 00:39:58,890
AUDIENCE: No.

786
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,630
PROFESSOR: So all right.

787
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,500
Grandma's happy.

788
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,750

789
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,145
AUDIENCE: You can deactivate
or activate these catalysts?

790
00:40:10,145 --> 00:40:11,610
I don't know.

791
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,350
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it's true, there's

792
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,230
some enzymes you can
activate, deactivate.

793
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:20,702
How you deactivate a protein
enzyme, if you wanted to?

794
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:21,670
AUDIENCE: Denature.

795
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,600
PROFESSOR: You could denature
it from heat or salt.

796
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,620
But that's maybe not one
of the most fundamental.

797
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,766
AUDIENCE: You should have a rate
from S to P without the enzyme.

798
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,140
PROFESSOR: Right so maybe
there should be a rate, S to P,

799
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,230
without the enzyme.

800
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,970
Although, I'm just
trying to tell you

801
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,200
about the rate of what
the enzyme is doing,

802
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,620
so you could write a
difference equation.

803
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,132
If I just let this model go to
infinity, then what happens?

804
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,980
AUDIENCE: You get P.

805
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,800
PROFESSOR: You get P.
And how much P is it?

806
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,340
A lot of P?

807
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,090
A little bit of P?

808
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,805
AUDIENCE: As much
as it can make.

809
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,370
PROFESSOR: It's all pee.

810
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,170
Right?

811
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,390
And how much substrate?

812
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,250
None, right?

813
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,600
So if I just let this go, you
have 0 substrate, all product.

814
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,210

815
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,990
Is that OK?

816
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:18,160
I mean is that, in
general-- I like product.

817
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,490

818
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,330
AUDIENCE: Time.

819
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,661
PROFESSOR: Time?

820
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,455
AUDIENCE: How much
time it would make too.

821
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:30,830
PROFESSOR: Well,
we can calculate

822
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,690
what the V is in this
model, and then we

823
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,981
could figure out what the time.

824
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:36,650

825
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,310
But there's something
wrong with that.

826
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,880
And normally I wouldn't
want to belabor the point,

827
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,105
but it's worth belaboring maybe.

828
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:45,730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

829
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,705
If we had a back reaction,
then that wouldn't happen.

830
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,330
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, so this gets back

831
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,490
to your back reaction, right?

832
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,260
And I like the back rate.

833
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,790
It's just there was
something a little more

834
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,540
fundamental than the way you
phrased it, was my concern.

835
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,250
Because what you said is,
there might be some back rate.

836
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,020
Right?

837
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,960
And I guess what I would say
is that there's kind of always

838
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,850
some back rate, or that
the equilibrium-- this is

839
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,160
fundamental-- the equilibrium
ratio between S and P,

840
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,775
how does the enzyme change it?

841
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:19,650
AUDIENCE: Not at all.

842
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,510
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
change it, right?

843
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,950
So if you take the
enzyme, invertase,

844
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,050
and you put it in a
test tube with sucrose,

845
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,040
it's going to break down almost
all that sucrose, really fast.

846
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,530
It's going to speed things up
by a factor of 10 to the 5,

847
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,690
or I don't know, by a lot.

848
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,869
But if you leave the
test tube for a year,

849
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,660
it comes to an equilibrium
with the enzyme.

850
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,490
If you left it in the test
you without the enzyme

851
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,010
for a million years, you
would get to the same outcome.

852
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,605
You come to some equilibrium
between the substrate

853
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:56,630
and the product.

854
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,200
And that's a function
of the kinetics.

855
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,215
There's a delta G and so
forth, but the important point

856
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:06,210
is that the enzyme does not
change that equilibrium.

857
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,739

858
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:10,114
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

859
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:13,042
This molecule is
effectively [INAUDIBLE].

860
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:15,482
If you leave it in a test
tube for a million years,

861
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:16,950
then the ATP will
all be consumed.

862
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

863
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,268
AUDIENCE: But if
you keep providing

864
00:43:20,268 --> 00:43:22,649
ATP, then you should--

865
00:43:22,649 --> 00:43:24,940
PROFESSOR: Well, first of
all, not all enzymes actually

866
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,005
are coupled to ATP.

867
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:29,560
So ATP is a way of putting
out a big delta G, right?

868
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,180
So that you can really
push things far.

869
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,340
And ATP could, in principle,
be included as a co-factor,

870
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,670
and then you take the
overall delta G of that,

871
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,380
and then calculate it.

872
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,985
But if you want
to keep on adding,

873
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:43,110
then it complicates things.

874
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,545
But I think, for many enzymes,
it's more straightforward

875
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:46,900
just to think about
enzymes that don't require

876
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,530
any extra input of energy.

877
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,390
So they're just lowering
the energy barrier

878
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,740
and they're just speeding
up the rate of reaction.

879
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,900
But the important point
there is that they're

880
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,020
speeding up both rates.

881
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,960

882
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,670
So the equilibrium between those
two is not going to change.

883
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,550
And that's why, this
thing, it's a great model,

884
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,290
but like all models
you have to make

885
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,680
sure you keep track of what the
assumptions are going into it.

886
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,659
Because this is going to
violate the laws of physics

887
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:16,200
if you take this
model too seriously.

888
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,971

889
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:21,429
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
what the fundamental principle

890
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,674
that's being violated is.

891
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:26,160
Because why is it not that
if you have it stable,

892
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,148
everything is product.

893
00:44:29,148 --> 00:44:31,140
You never see as in nature.

894
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,973
I mean, how is that not
a physical situation?

895
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,014
AUDIENCE 2: So if you can
get a really small test

896
00:44:37,014 --> 00:44:41,365
tube with one G and one
S, isn't it just like--

897
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:42,740
PROFESSOR: But
the same statement

898
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,260
that we talked about
for single, then

899
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,490
you would want-- if you had
just a single substrate going

900
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,281
to product-- then you
want to look probably

901
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:49,290
at the time average.

902
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,100
Because, the thing is that
the equilibrium is determined

903
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,280
by the delta G of the reaction.

904
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,670
And that's going to determine
the equilibrium, whether you

905
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,380
have the enzyme there or not.

906
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,960
So if the delta G
is such that it's

907
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,110
at equilibrium--
sort of 90% product,

908
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,812
10% substrate-- then
what you can do is go,

909
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,520
well if you start out
with all substrate,

910
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,240
this model may work wonderfully.

911
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,490
But then as you're getting
closer to that equilibrium,

912
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,281
then this model's going
to be breaking down

913
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:23,930
because this model
is not accounting

914
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,780
for the back reaction,
as you were saying.

915
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,990
But I just want to stress that
it's not just a detailed model,

916
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,124
or it's not just a
failure for some enzymes,

917
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:33,540
this is the way
that enzymes work.

918
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,980

919
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,536
Are there other
questions about this?

920
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,160
Or different ways of
thinking about it?

921
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,375

922
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,250
So, it's not used up.

923
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:51,990
It speeds up reaction
in both directions.

924
00:45:51,990 --> 00:46:03,655

925
00:46:03,655 --> 00:46:05,738
AUDIENCE: I mean, but
that's not necessarily true.

926
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:07,702
You can have an
enzyme that is only

927
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:11,160
really capable of
going in one direction.

928
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,140
PROFESSOR: Really?

929
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,510
We should meet after class
and you can give me your--

930
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,456
AUDIENCE: It basically binds
in a particular direction.

931
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:19,830
PROFESSOR: It's
just not allowed.

932
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:26,280

933
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,744
So it's true that
enzymes can be--

934
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,410
and this is getting to the other
fundamental point of an enzyme,

935
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,090
which is that they,
especially enzymes in biology,

936
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,690
can be exquisitely specific.

937
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,420
What you're saying
is that it's really

938
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,010
only catalyzing this
one, weird reaction,

939
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:50,380
going from some funny substrate
to some funny product, right?

940
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,360
But that enzyme also speeds
up that back reaction,

941
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,590
going from the funny product
to the funny substrate.

942
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:04,560
And that's just like
the nature of the beast.

943
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,140
I'm try to think of what I can--

944
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,575
AUDIENCE: That's where you
have one enzyme going one way,

945
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:15,900
and another going the
other way in biology.

946
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,510
PROFESSOR: So it
does happen there,

947
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,400
but then what they
are often doing

948
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,670
is they're coupling things to
ATP hydrolysis or something,

949
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:31,240
in order to actually make that
reaction go in the single way.

950
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,440
Just as kind of like a general
statement-- because the way

951
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,010
these things work is that
there's some over here

952
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,080
and it's over here
somehow, and these enzymes,

953
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,236
they just lower
this energy barrier.

954
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:47,736
AUDIENCE: So the
thing that confused

955
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,950
me at first is that I was
just thinking of rates,

956
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,019
and I think the thing
that's important

957
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,931
is to just realize again that
the enzyme doesn't change

958
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:59,090
the thermodynamics, it
only changes that variable

959
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,180
to change where they are.

960
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,600
So the key thing
is that it doesn't

961
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,071
change the ratio of the
product through the substrate,

962
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:08,020
the rates are realatively--

963
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,580
PROFESSOR: Right, because from
a thermodynamic standpoint,

964
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,350
it's not used up, which
means there's an enzyme here

965
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,230
and an enzyme here.

966
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,840
So these final states,
you can think about only

967
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,620
in terms of the substrate
and the product,

968
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,582
because the enzyme was there
in both beginning and ending.

969
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:25,040
So from a thermodynamic
standpoint,

970
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,980
it's just you're not
allowed to change

971
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,413
one rate without the other.

972
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:32,200

973
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:42,970
Now in the reading, you saw
the Michaelis Menten kinetics,

974
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:48,980
where you found
that once you reach

975
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,510
this equilibrium between the
enzyme substrate complex,

976
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,330
the velocity can be
described by something

977
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,140
that is rather simple.

978
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:03,820
There's some Km plus S,
and then there's some Vmax.

979
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,500

980
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,940
And if the substrate
concentration,

981
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,540
the total concentration
is very large,

982
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:14,810
then you can just think
about this is the S total.

983
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,520
Now in this case,
this, once again,

984
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,450
can be thought of in this limit
of if the enzyme concentration

985
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,950
is really small, then this
is really just the fraction

986
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,350
of the enzyme that's bound.

987
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:29,825

988
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:31,700
So we've already spent
a lot of time thinking

989
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,830
about how to get at
the fraction bound,

990
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:42,670
and the question is, what
should this Km be here?

991
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,000
Now that I've told you that
it's the fraction bound,

992
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,480
is it just going to be the
same thing that we had before?

993
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,020
Is the Km the same
thing is the Kd?

994
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,490

995
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,075
So remember, before, we found
that Kd was just Kr over Kf.

996
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:03,710

997
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,770
But you should, in principle,
be able ti just look at that

998
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,420
and say what fraction
bound should be.

999
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,294

1000
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:16,647
AUDIENCE: Is it Kr over Kf
plus-- other way around,

1001
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,050
Kr plus Kcat over Kf

1002
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,475
PROFESSOR: Yes, because
now, from the standpoint

1003
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:27,330
of the enzyme, there's some rate
at which you form the complex.

1004
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,650
And now the lifetime
of that complex

1005
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,496
has been reduced,
because now there

1006
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:33,790
are two ways for the complex
to fall apart, right?

1007
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,680
One, is could just go
back where it came from,

1008
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,200
but the other is that you
can catalyze the reaction.

1009
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,350
So, from the standpoint of the
enzyme and the fraction bound,

1010
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,330
then we can just--
the entire discussion

1011
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,130
that we had before--
we can just replace Kd

1012
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,680
with this new
Michaelis constant, Km.

1013
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,130
Where now, we say now it's the
Kr up in the numerator still,

1014
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,810
but now, instead of just
being Kf at the bottom,

1015
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,760
we have to add Kcat,
because there are just

1016
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,510
two ways that that
enzyme substrate

1017
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,430
complex can fall apart.

1018
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:13,160

1019
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,354
Oh I'm sorry, I've
already messed up.

1020
00:51:15,354 --> 00:51:18,258

1021
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:26,815
Kf over-- So Kcat
has to be with Kr.

1022
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:36,490

1023
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:39,265
So it just kind of speeds up the
effective rate of dissociation.

1024
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:42,730

1025
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,300
And of course, depending
whether Kcat is large or small

1026
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,860
as compared to Kr, this can be
either a large or small effect.

1027
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,100
But these rates, they just add.

1028
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,630
And we'll spend a lot of time
thinking about how rates add

1029
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:02,259
and so forth in a few weeks.

1030
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:04,008
AUDIENCE: For this
expression to be valid,

1031
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:06,664
don't you need Kcat to be much
longer than the other rates?

1032
00:52:06,664 --> 00:52:07,580
PROFESSOR: Right, yes.

1033
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,485
So you want Kcat
to be-- So there's

1034
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:13,110
various kinds of limits in which
you can talk about this thing.

1035
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,600
So in general, what you
want is Kcat to be small,

1036
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,652
and you also want the initial
transient to have gone away.

1037
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:21,360
Because when you first
add the substrate,

1038
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,290
you don't yet have any
enzyme substrate complex.

1039
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,460
So you have to wait
until you've gotten

1040
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,454
to this so-called steady state,
where the Michaelis Menten

1041
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:31,120
formula applies.

1042
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,150
And then you also
can't have let it

1043
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,890
go too far, because
then of course you're

1044
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,556
going to start running
out of substrate.

1045
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:49,326

1046
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:51,200
In the homework, you're
going to get a chance

1047
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,366
to play with Michaelis
Menten kinetics a little bit,

1048
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:56,420
and think about the
dynamics when you have

1049
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,270
different kinds of inhibitors.

1050
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,320
So you can imagine having
inhibitors that inhibit

1051
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,390
multiple different ways.

1052
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,270
You could have an inhibitor
the binds the enzyme,

1053
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,230
and prevents the enzyme from
providing the substrate.

1054
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,875
Now should this effect the Vmax?

1055
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:21,802

1056
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:23,260
We'll think about
it for 10 seconds

1057
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,050
and we'll vote because
it's so much fun.

1058
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,760
We have these cards.

1059
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,930
Vmax change-- and this
is with an inhibitor

1060
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:41,650
that binds here-- and forming
an EI complex, reversibly.

1061
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,655
The question is,
does Vmax change?

1062
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:55,020

1063
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,560
A is yes and B is no.

1064
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,320

1065
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,630
I'll give you 10 seconds
to think about this.

1066
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:12,570
So Vmax is, again, defined as
this rate of product formation

1067
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,370
at saturation, when you
have a lot of the substrate.

1068
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:34,460

1069
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,290
Do you need time?

1070
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:39,489
Or will time help?

1071
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:40,530
Well who wants more time?

1072
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,821
Just nod if you want more time.

1073
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:45,260

1074
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,930
OK, well let's see how we feel.

1075
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,820
Let's go ahead and vote.

1076
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,510
If I add this
competitive inhibitor,

1077
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,640
the question is,
will be Vmax change?

1078
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,300
Ready.

1079
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,930
Three, two, one.

1080
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,830
So we have a majority
of Bs, but some As.

1081
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,570
Can somebody give the intuition
for why the Vmax should not

1082
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,070
change?

1083
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,120

1084
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,156
Yes.

1085
00:55:12,156 --> 00:55:18,108
AUDIENCE: Vmax is
when substrate is

1086
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:21,580
far excess to the enzyme
and, at that time,

1087
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,260
all of the enzymes bond to the
substrate not to the inhibitor.

1088
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,260
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

1089
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,415
So Vmax occurs when you have
lots and lots of substrate.

1090
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:31,790
And, of course,
the condition you

1091
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,170
have to be a little bit
careful, because it's not just

1092
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,120
having more substrate
than the enzyme,

1093
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,490
but it's when the
substrate is saturating.

1094
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,470
So if you have lots
and lots of substrate,

1095
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,210
then the important
point there is

1096
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,436
that it's when you've
pushed this reaction all

1097
00:55:45,436 --> 00:55:49,414
the way over here, all
the enzyme is bound,

1098
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:51,580
and that's when you get
this maximal rate of product

1099
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,680
formation.

1100
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,328
And that's true, you might
need more substrate in order

1101
00:55:55,328 --> 00:55:57,036
to get all that enzyme
bound, because you

1102
00:55:57,036 --> 00:56:00,870
have to pull the enzyme away
from this side reaction.

1103
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,330
And, indeed, this
kind of inhibitor

1104
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:07,820
alters the Km, the effect
of Km of the reaction.

1105
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:13,380
But it does not
affect this Vmax,

1106
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,300
whereas other inhibitors
can bind this complex

1107
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,300
and prevent it from
catalyzing the reaction.

1108
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,800
And that will instead affect
Vmax, but won't affect Km.

1109
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,340
So this was a powerful
way that enzymologists

1110
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,020
have used to try to get at
mechanism of inhibitors.

1111
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,550
So if you have
some small molecule

1112
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,309
you know somehow inhibits
some enzymatic reaction

1113
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:40,100
and you want to know,
how is it doing that?

1114
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,630
One thing you can do is you
can titrate in that inhibitor

1115
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,130
and then measure
the Michaelis Menten

1116
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,520
curve to get out the
Vmax and Km to try

1117
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,820
to get a sense mechanism.

1118
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,340
And I always say we should
be drawing these things.

1119
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,240
So V is a function
of-- and this is

1120
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,950
in the [? lit ?] for
a lot of substrate

1121
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,780
relative to the enzyme--
then we can indeed

1122
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:10,620
say it's going to plateau
in Vmax at concentration Km.

1123
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,150
It's at 1/2.

1124
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,580

1125
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,040
And then it plateaus.

1126
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,390
This is a very, very,
very common curve.

1127
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:26,090
Lots of things in biology and
life start at 0 and plateau,

1128
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,455
and there are almost only
two ways you can do that.

1129
00:57:28,455 --> 00:57:29,830
OK, there are more
than two ways,

1130
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,880
but there are a very small
number of ways you can do that.

1131
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,919
This is one of them.

1132
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:38,050

1133
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:42,480
Any questions on these Michaelis
and Menten kinetics inhibitors?

1134
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,990
You're going to spend a couple
hours over the next few days

1135
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,270
thinking about this.

1136
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:54,720

1137
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,190
So what I want to do
for the last 20 minutes

1138
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,250
is switch gears a
little bit and to think

1139
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,757
about the simple dynamics
of gene expression.

1140
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:05,590
The ideas that we've
just been talking about

1141
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,915
end up being just very relevant
for the simple models here.

1142
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:13,040
So what we want to think
about is a situation where

1143
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,740
we have some transcription
factor, X, that is activating

1144
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:26,930
expression of gene Y. So we
have X activating Y. Now,

1145
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,810
the way we can think
about this, for example,

1146
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:34,350
is that we may have X,
which together with some

1147
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:42,530
signal S of X, turns
into some X star

1148
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:48,150
It's X star that can
bind to the promoter

1149
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:59,360
and lead to expression of Y.

1150
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,040
Now in Uri's book, he
talks about this idea

1151
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,160
of a separation of
time scales that

1152
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,360
is often useful to invoke when
thinking about gene expression.

1153
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,860
In this context, what
was the fast event?

1154
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,527

1155
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:18,610
AUDIENCE: Activation of X?

1156
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,360
PROFESSOR: Activation
of X. So in many cases,

1157
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,730
if this is a sugar or a small
molecule that is going to be,

1158
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:31,150
in this case, activating X, that
can occur really quite quickly.

1159
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,180
Often maybe less than a second.

1160
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,900
The rate-limiting step
would then, in many cases,

1161
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,980
be getting the signal
into the cell, so

1162
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,450
depending on how that works.

1163
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,680
So this occurs very rapidly.

1164
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,160
What that means is if
we look at a signal Sx,

1165
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,790
as a function of time, where
it starts out being absent

1166
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,430
and then, all of a sudden, sugar
appears in the environment,

1167
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,100
we can think about the
concentration of X and X star

1168
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:09,400
So X starts out high and then
quickly goes down, right?

1169
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:16,270
Whereas X star will do the
reverse here, quickly comes up.

1170
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,345
And this should be flat.

1171
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:20,090

1172
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,180
Now, what is it that Y will
do as a function of time?

1173
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,050

1174
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,360
So if X is an activator that
means that before X star became

1175
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,500
available, there was
no expression of Y.

1176
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,490
So it should be low.

1177
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:42,130

1178
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,550
So X is quickly activated,
turns into X star.

1179
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:52,171
So we start expressing
Y. So, roughly,

1180
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:53,462
what does this curve look like?

1181
01:00:53,462 --> 01:01:03,100

1182
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,666
Somebody please help me.

1183
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,155
AUDIENCE: It's S-shaped.

1184
01:01:08,155 --> 01:01:09,780
PROFESSOR: OK, so it
could be S-shaped.

1185
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:15,590

1186
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,420
The thing that's very
fast is activation of X,

1187
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,570
and then what's really
still rather fast

1188
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,450
is equilibration of X
star on this promoter.

1189
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,270
So that might
still be very rapid

1190
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:31,610
because these things were
nearly instantaneous, But.

1191
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,590
Coming to equilibrium here
still might happen over

1192
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,580
time scales of seconds.

1193
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,730
So that means that you
actually, sort of quickly,

1194
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,710
start getting expression,
at least on time scales

1195
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:46,180
are relevant in terms of
hours kind of time scales.

1196
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,750
Of course, it still does
take time to express.

1197
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:54,950
So it takes minutes for the
RNA polymerase to transcribe,

1198
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,720
and then of course
the ribosome's

1199
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,970
going to have to do something.

1200
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:04,024

1201
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:04,940
What do I want to ask?

1202
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,530

1203
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,500
Let's write down the
equation that Uri

1204
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,569
invokes because there's a
very real sense in which it

1205
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:17,360
does, maybe, look a
little bit more S-like.

1206
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,010
But at least in terms of
Uri's kind of formalism,

1207
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,510
he often would say, the
change in the concentration

1208
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,260
of this protein, it's going
to be some function of,

1209
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,510
in this case X star.

1210
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,590

1211
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,740
And then there's another term
here, which was the minus alpha

1212
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,714
Y. What was the
minus alpha Y due to?

1213
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,630
AUDIENCE: Degradation.

1214
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,210
PROFESSOR: Right, so
there are two terms.

1215
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:47,150
So there's alpha, and it's going
to be the sum of two things.

1216
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:51,060
There's alpha due
to degradation.

1217
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:55,230
So if the protein is degraded
actively in some way.

1218
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,960
If the protein is
not degraded, then

1219
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,940
does that mean that
alpha is equal to 0?

1220
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,750
No.

1221
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,504
So what is this other term?

1222
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:05,420
AUDIENCE: Cell growth.

1223
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,544
PROFESSOR: Right, so it's
alpha due to some growth.

1224
01:03:07,544 --> 01:03:13,800
And cell growth leads
to some dilution effect.

1225
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,260
So if you have the same
number of proteins in the cell

1226
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,760
that the cell is
growing, that means

1227
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,240
the concentration is shrinking.

1228
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,780
Right?

1229
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,210
Now the reality
of this process is

1230
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:26,380
that it's complicated, because
cell growth is not uniform.

1231
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,610
But if you kind of
average over things,

1232
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,230
then a reasonable
description is just to say,

1233
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,540
just a first order
effective dilution rate.

1234
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:41,960
If you want to, you can write
down a more detailed formula,

1235
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,900
or a model where, you say
if cell growth does this,

1236
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,164
then-- It's going to kind
of wiggle a little bit

1237
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:48,580
over the course
of the cell cycle,

1238
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,860
but this is a
reasonable description.

1239
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,700
Now what this is saying
is that even if there

1240
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,550
is no active degradation,
then there still

1241
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,760
is an effective term
due to this dilution.

1242
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,610
And this means that if
we immediately activate,

1243
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,070
and if F of X star-- at time
T equal to 0 here-- if it just

1244
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:12,880
goes to some beta, then
what is the long time

1245
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,990
solution of this equation?

1246
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:17,750

1247
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,700
AUDIENCE: Beta/alpha.

1248
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,970
PROFESSOR: Beta/alpha, right?

1249
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:23,140
So we know it should
eventually come to beta/alpha.

1250
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,538

1251
01:04:27,538 --> 01:04:29,912
What's the characteristic time
scale for it to get there?

1252
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:36,716

1253
01:04:36,716 --> 01:04:40,582
AUDIENCE: Cell alpha's
rate, it's 1/alpha.

1254
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:41,290
PROFESSOR: Right.

1255
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,141
So characteristic
time is 1/alpha.

1256
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:45,890
The solution to this
differential equation

1257
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:53,850
is just an exponential where,
if extend this line here,

1258
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,580
this is 1/alpha.

1259
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,120
So that's time.

1260
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,060
And then, of course,
the T 1/2, the time

1261
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,340
it takes to get to 1/2, is
indeed different by log 2,

1262
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,877
and that's the
cell division time.

1263
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:10,330

1264
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:17,220
This point here-- this is
at T 1/2-- is cell division.

1265
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,155
This is for a stable protein,
assuming that alpha degradation

1266
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:21,738
is equal to 0.

1267
01:05:21,738 --> 01:05:25,950

1268
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,150
So the thing to remember is
that this basic differential

1269
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:34,450
equation of Y dot is equal
to a minus alpha Y, is

1270
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:37,264
an exponential by going to 0.

1271
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:39,180
Whereas if you have a
constant term here, then

1272
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,180
it's an exponential going
to some nonzero value.

1273
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,750

1274
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:49,990
So, indeed, if the
signal here goes away,

1275
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,250
then we quickly come back here.

1276
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,755
So this comes here.

1277
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:59,620
This comes here, and then this--
does it go back down to 0?

1278
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,840
Is it more or less
rapid returning to 0

1279
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,810
than it took to come up?

1280
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:09,160

1281
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,820
All right.

1282
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,320
OK.

1283
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,860

1284
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,585
So, how can I phrase this?

1285
01:06:17,585 --> 01:06:20,570

1286
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:27,330
OK, faster decay, question mark.

1287
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:32,840
A is yes, and B is
no, and you can always

1288
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,500
do C or something if you
don't know what I'm asking.

1289
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,460
The question is, we've
turned off the signal,

1290
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,580
is it going to go away faster,
or slower, or the same?

1291
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:47,830

1292
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:48,455
This is faster.

1293
01:06:48,455 --> 01:06:51,440

1294
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,530
B can even be slower maybe.

1295
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,175
C is same.

1296
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:59,640

1297
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,900
Do you understand
the options now?

1298
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,734
So we stopped expressing
Y, so concentration of X

1299
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:07,900
is going to decrease, right?

1300
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:12,110
Question is, it is going
to go away faster, slower,

1301
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,310
or the same as the
rate that it came up?

1302
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:20,330

1303
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:23,150
Do you need more time?

1304
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:23,980
Ready.

1305
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,060
Three, two, one.

1306
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:30,100

1307
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,000
OK so we have a fair
agreement that, this thing,

1308
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,140
it's going to be the same.

1309
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,550
So there's a characteristic
time for it to come

1310
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:45,350
and it's the same characteristic
time for it to degrade away.

1311
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:51,570
So this, I would say,
is not a priori obvious,

1312
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:55,450
but it's really just
the nature of when you

1313
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:58,122
have these sorts of situations.

1314
01:07:58,122 --> 01:07:59,580
This sets the time
scale for if you

1315
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,650
want to change the
concentration-- doesn't matter

1316
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,441
whether you're going
to 0, a finite number,

1317
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:05,630
or if you go from high
to low, but not 0.

1318
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,796
Again, it's going to be
exponential in the same time

1319
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,930
scale.

1320
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:12,722
So if you want
that to be faster,

1321
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,680
if you want to be able
to respond more rapidly,

1322
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:21,420
then one solution would be to
actively degrade the protein.

1323
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:21,970
Right?

1324
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,500
Now it's obvious that
degrading the protein actively

1325
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,470
will allow it to go
way more rapidly.

1326
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,700
What's perhaps less
obvious is that there's

1327
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,229
a real sense in which
degrading the protein allows

1328
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:37,930
this response to be
more rapid as well.

1329
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:42,440
But of course, did we
keep everything constant?

1330
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,502
If I say, oh I want the
curve to look like this,

1331
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:46,210
can I just increase
the degradation rate?

1332
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,472

1333
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:52,279
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1334
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,500
PROFESSOR: Well let's say
that X star is already maximal

1335
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,380
saturating.

1336
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,193
So we're already-- well, OK.

1337
01:08:59,193 --> 01:08:59,859
So I understand.

1338
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:02,630
OK, now I understand
what you're saying.

1339
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,630
You need to increase beta,
and that could either

1340
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,609
be by increasing
X star or it could

1341
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:11,060
be just by increasing the
strength of that promoter.

1342
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,039
So the idea is that if you
want a more rapid on or off,

1343
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:16,830
you can also increase
the degradation rate.

1344
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,640
But there's a cost
to that, which

1345
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,109
is that you have to
make more protein.

1346
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:27,640
And, indeed, many transcription
factors are actively degraded.

1347
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,520
And that may be because if you
are using these transcription

1348
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,069
factors to turn
things on and off,

1349
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:37,350
then you want to
get rapid responses.

1350
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,560
And, also, transcription
factors are often not

1351
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,314
expressed at the same high
levels as structural proteins.

1352
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:44,189
So that means that the
cost of degrading them

1353
01:09:44,189 --> 01:09:46,450
is not going to be as severe.

1354
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:52,024
If you're actively degrading
cell wall type of things,

1355
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,399
that's going to
be really costly.

1356
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:56,175

1357
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:57,550
Are there any
questions of what I

1358
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,790
mean by this discussion
of active degradation,

1359
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,370
why it might help, costs?

1360
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,540
Because, over the
next week or two,

1361
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,560
we're going to see
multiple possible solutions

1362
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,320
to this problem.

1363
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,260
If you want to increase
the rate that you respond

1364
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,490
to some environmental
change, one way you can do it

1365
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,824
is by actively degrading some
of the signaling proteins.

1366
01:10:17,824 --> 01:10:20,240
But there are other solutions
we're going to come up with,

1367
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,240
such as auto regulation.

1368
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:29,167

1369
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:30,750
In the last few
minutes here, I wanted

1370
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:36,240
to say something about this
question of ultrasensitivity.

1371
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,660
So there are many
cases where you

1372
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:43,350
would like to get very
sensitive responses, i.e.

1373
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,570
you'd like to be able
to make a modest change

1374
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:48,080
in the concentration of some,
for example, transcription

1375
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,965
factor, and get a significant
change in-- I don't know why

1376
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:55,272
I erased that but--
and you want to be

1377
01:10:55,272 --> 01:10:58,370
able to get a significant
change in the output.

1378
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,050
And one way that
you can do this is

1379
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,490
by having some sort of
cooperative binding.

1380
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:05,070
If you have dimerization
of a transcription factor

1381
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,930
before binding then
you, for example,

1382
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,470
can get a more
sensitive response.

1383
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:14,760
So one way to think that this
is if you have an X activating Y

1384
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,280
right in this simple
case, then the rate

1385
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:27,440
of Y expression
as a function of--

1386
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,680
and here we're going
to write X for now

1387
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:35,500
and we'll just assume that
all Xs are indeed active.

1388
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,380
OK?

1389
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,910
Now if it just is a
single X binding Y,

1390
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:43,580
then this should behave just
like this Michaelis Menten

1391
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,280
formula, where there's some
maximal rate of expression

1392
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,730
here.

1393
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:54,100
There's going to be some Kd,
which is bound 1/2 the time,

1394
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,454
and then some curve
that looks like this.

1395
01:11:56,454 --> 01:11:58,120
So this would be an
example of something

1396
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,310
that is not ultrasensitive
and that you

1397
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:06,350
don't get a significant change
in the rate of Y expression--

1398
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:12,500
or the equilibrium Y
value, if you'd like--

1399
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,110
as a function of changing X.

1400
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,212
As you start having
more and more X,

1401
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:18,670
you would need get
more and more Y,

1402
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:23,080
but that ratio, if you
double X, you always

1403
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:29,260
get less than a doubling
of Y. So the question is,

1404
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,230
what can you do to make
things somehow more sensitive?

1405
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:37,580
You'd like something that
looks a little bit more--

1406
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:44,160
well the ultimate would
be 0 and then beta.

1407
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,170
And indeed this would be
this logic kind of limit.

1408
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,380
So this is Y expression
as a function of X.

1409
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,760
If you didn't get any until some
Kd and then all of a sudden you

1410
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,880
had beta, that would be
as sensitive as you could

1411
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,550
possibly-- this is
ultra-, ultra- sensitive.

1412
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:06,450

1413
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:09,164
So there's one solution that
was talked about in the book

1414
01:13:09,164 --> 01:13:11,330
to get something that's a
little bit more like this.

1415
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:14,460

1416
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,710
AUDIENCE: Cooperative binding.

1417
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,251
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
cooperative binding.

1418
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:23,700
So we often describe
these functions--

1419
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,080
this is the rate of expression
as a function of X--

1420
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,420
as via some hill equation.

1421
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,580
So I'm just going
to write Xs here.

1422
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:37,720
So it could be there's
X, K plus X here.

1423
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,180
Now if you have
cooperative binding

1424
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,560
either at the side of the
promoter or dimerization,

1425
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,950
trimerzation, something
before binding,

1426
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:49,810
you can get some effective
hill coverage in here,

1427
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:52,516
where this is going to be
up X to the n, X to the n, K

1428
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:53,240
to then.

1429
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,965
We put K to n here just so
that all the units are still

1430
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,260
reasonable.

1431
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,920
And as n increases, this thing
becomes more and more sensitive

1432
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,220
or ultrasensitive.

1433
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,950
So this is with n
just equal to 1,

1434
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:09,430
just a monomer binding
in a simple way.

1435
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,150
Kd is still the 1/2 mark.

1436
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:15,590
So things always cross
here, but if it's 2

1437
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:20,610
then it might look like
this, now three, four.

1438
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:24,121
So it gets steeper and steeper
as that hill coefficient

1439
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:24,620
increases.

1440
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:34,090

1441
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:38,065
As Uri mentions, for many input
in many genes, if you go in

1442
01:14:38,065 --> 01:14:39,690
and you measure these
things, you often

1443
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,265
get something that's reasonably
well-defined by the S

1444
01:14:42,265 --> 01:14:45,060
with a n somewhere
between 1 and 4.

1445
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,251
So things are often
moderately cooperative.

1446
01:14:47,251 --> 01:14:57,020

1447
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,120
Maybe I'll just tell you
about this other mechanism

1448
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,620
for ultrasensitivity, this
idea of molecular titration.

1449
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,010
I'm going to leave you with the
basic model, or the basic idea,

1450
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:10,820
and then at the beginning
of class on Thursday,

1451
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,390
we will try to
figure out what are

1452
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,227
the requirements for the
various binding affinities

1453
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:16,560
in order for that model to work.

1454
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,920

1455
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,460
So what's neat
about this is it's

1456
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,440
a situation where
you can get something

1457
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,705
that is ultrasensitive
without any cooperativity.

1458
01:15:29,705 --> 01:15:33,950

1459
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:40,530
The idea is that you have
some X that is indeed

1460
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:46,250
binding to the promoter to
activate expression of Y,

1461
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:51,720
but, in addition, you have
some other protein, say W,

1462
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:58,535
that can bind to X and turn
it into this complex XW.

1463
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:01,710

1464
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:06,580
So we can always describe
things as there's some Kw here,

1465
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:11,900
some Kd for X to
bind to the promoter,

1466
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:20,960
and for some relations
of Kw, Kd, and W

1467
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,450
total, you can get
ultrasensitivity.

1468
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:28,810
What happens is that if you look
at this rate of expression--

1469
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:34,250
so this is Y expression--
as a function of X,

1470
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:39,260
if you don't have any W here,
then indeed it just looks

1471
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,540
like our standard thing here.

1472
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,290

1473
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:47,960
Whereas in the this
is when you add W,

1474
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,790
when you add this molecular
titration phenomenon,

1475
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,710
you can make this curve
slide over so you don't

1476
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,310
get significant
expression until X--

1477
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,790
or this is X total
if you'd like--

1478
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,974
is larger than W total and this
whole curve just slides over.

1479
01:17:03,974 --> 01:17:09,170

1480
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:12,367
You can see this
is ultrasensitive.

1481
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:14,200
So nothing happens until
all of a sudden you

1482
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,280
start getting expression.

1483
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,530
So what we're going to do
is on the beginning of class

1484
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,330
on Thursday, we'll
try to figure out

1485
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:26,390
what is the relationship
between these different binding

1486
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:30,240
parameters in order to get
something that looks like this.

1487
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:34,280

1488
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,910
Are there any questions
about anything

1489
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,527
that we've said so far today?

1490
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:42,350

1491
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:45,180
With that, why don't
we go ahead and quit.
