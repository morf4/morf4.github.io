JEFF GORE: Today, what we want
to do is focus more explicitly

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,890
on bacterial chemotaxis.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,560
Of course, a
discussion that we had

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,330
on Thursday about "Life
at Low Reynolds Numbers"

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,290
is certainly very
relevant to this question

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,390
of how bacteria are
maybe able to find food

16
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,380
or what constraints
they're faced in trying

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,530
to solve this problem.

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,900
Today, we're going to
discuss in more depth

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,570
this idea of the biased random
walk that runs and tumbles

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,240
that we talked about on
Thursday, that allow bacteria

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680
to swim towards attractants
and away from repellents.

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,530
But in particular,
there's something

23
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,330
that is rather subtle about the
particular biased random walk

24
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,310
that bacteria implement.

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,170
Now, the way that you
might kind of naively

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,170
imagine that this
thing would work

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,100
is that you would just have
this tumbling frequency be

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,850
a function of the concentration
of the attractant, for example.

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,210
And that indeed would allow
you to swim or to execute

30
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,650
a biased random walk
towards, say, food sources,

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,910
towards attractants,
but it would not

32
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,760
be effective over a very
wide range of concentrations.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,697
However, if you experimentally
ask, how well can bacteria

34
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:27,280
swim towards
attractants, it turns out

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,690
they can respond over
five orders of magnitude

36
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,700
of concentration of these
attractants, which is really

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,760
quite incredible, if you think
about the engineering challenge

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,950
that these little one-micron
cells are able to overcome.

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,690
And the basic way that
they do this is they

40
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,840
implement what's essentially
equivalent to integral feedback

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,630
in the context of engineering,
where it turns out

42
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,081
that the steady-state tumbling
frequency, so the frequency

43
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,580
of which they'd
execute one of these

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,414
tumbles that randomizes their
motion, that displays what's

45
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:01,580
known as perfect adaptation.

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:08,770
It's not a function of the
concentration of-- if you have

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,746
a constant concentration
of an attractant,

48
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,120
then it's not a
function of that.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,720
Of course, changes in
concentrations it responds to,

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,790
but somehow, E. coli and
many other microorganisms

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,900
are able to implement this
very clever thing where

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,540
the steady-state frequency
of tumbling, of changing

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,040
direction, is somehow
not a function

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,290
of the overall
attractant concentration.

55
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,010
Now, that's already an
interesting, I think,

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,470
phenomenon.

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,040
And in some ways,
you can think of it

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,550
as some kind of
robustness, because there

59
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,990
is some way in which this
tumbling frequency is

60
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,372
robust against constant changes
in the level of attractants.

61
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:48,830
And it's that
aspect, I think, that

62
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,160
makes this example both
rather subtle but also

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,610
quite confusing, because
it's the phenomenon

64
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,430
of perfect adaptation
that already

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,630
has some aspects of
robustness, but it's

66
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,480
this phenomenon of
perfect adaptation

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,679
that is robust against changes
in concentrations of proteins,

68
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,970
for example, the concentration
of the protein [? key ?]

69
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,650
R that we're going
to talk about.

70
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,960
So I think that this
is in some ways maybe

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,120
the prettiest
example that we have

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,100
of this principle
of robustness, but I

73
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,180
think it's also in
some ways the most

74
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,840
tricky to wrap your head around,
because it's sort of robustness

75
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,340
of a robustness in some ways.

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,665

77
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:30,170
All right.

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,640
So our goal for today is
going to be to make sure

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,120
that we understand the challenge
that E. coli are facing

80
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,340
and then to try to understand
the genetic circuit

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,370
that they use in order to
overcome this challenge.

82
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,450
So what I'm going to do for
the next hour and 15 minutes

83
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,460
is we're going to leave
this network up on the board

84
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,910
so that any time that
you're confused about what

85
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,990
is R, B, Z, Y, so
forth, you can kind of

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,480
look up here and remind
yourself what this thing is.

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,910
But hopefully, the
reading from last night

88
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,290
will help you in
following what's going on.

89
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,855
There are a fair number of
letters, I will admit it.

90
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:17,300

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,930
So first, I just
want to make sure

92
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,410
that we're all
kind of remembering

93
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,200
the basic phenomenon
that we're trying

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,300
to study, which is this idea of
consecutive runs and tumbles.

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,170
So this random walk is really
composed of what you might call

96
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,630
or what we do call runs,
where the bacteria goes sort

97
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,430
of straight and
then tumbles, which

98
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,240
they randomize their motion.

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:52,020
So this is runs and tumbles,
where bacteria, they

100
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:02,970
go semi-straight for of order
a second-- order one second--

101
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,420
and this is the run.

102
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,620
Then, they have
this tumbling that

103
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,460
might last about one second,
so a 0.1 second tumble,

104
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,890
over which the motion is
sort of random in this axis

105
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,750
of the orientation.

106
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,360
And then, they kind of
go in a new direction

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,870
and then tumble again and then
new direction and so forth.

108
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,590

109
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,920
So it's runs
followed by tumbles.

110
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,680

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,470
Now, the thing that
changes depending

112
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,450
on whether the cells
are sensing that they're

113
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,730
moving up or down, say,
an attractant gradient

114
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,730
is the frequency of
those tumbles, i.e.

115
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,870
how long are the runs?

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,090
I said that they're
around one second,

117
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,020
but this will vary depending
upon whether bacteria

118
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,540
sense that things
are getting better

119
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,706
or things are getting worse.

120
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:10,140

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,440
Can somebody remind us how
the bacteria actually execute

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,525
one of these tumble motions?

123
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:20,728

124
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,228
Yes?

125
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:24,180
AUDIENCE: They have this other
motors-- they have mini-motors

126
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,902
in their flagella
and they usually

127
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,680
all spin one way, which I
think is counterclockwise.

128
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
JEFF GORE: That's right.

129
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,040
I always have trouble--
so the runs are indeed

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,414
when these things are
rotating counterclockwise.

131
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:35,038
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

132
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,585
And one of them can
decide to switch

133
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,910
and start turning clockwise.

134
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,015
And what it does, it just
sort of-- I don't know.

135
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,890
I just imagine it throws
the whole motor off.

136
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,860
JEFF GORE: Exactly.

137
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:52,920
And the flagella in the context
of-- so we have our E. coli.

138
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,530
The velocity is of order,
say, 30 microns per second.

139
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,002

140
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,960
Now, they have these
flagella that are actually

141
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,650
distributed-- the motors
are actually distributed

142
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,010
across the entire cell.

143
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,580
So it's not just on the back.

144
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,690
But then, these individual
filaments kind of

145
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,450
come together towards
the back and then

146
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,400
they have this corkscrew shape.

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
When these things
are all rotating

148
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,050
in the counterclockwise
direction,

149
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,870
that corresponds to a run,
when there's directed motion.

150
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,230
But then if one of
them goes clockwise,

151
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,207
the bundle falls apart.

152
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,290
And indeed, there are some
very nice movies online

153
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,930
where you can see that when
they're going clockwise,

154
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,030
you see that the flagella are
kind of doing crazy things

155
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,650
and that causes this
thing to kind of tumble

156
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,650
in a random orientation.

157
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,350
So it randomizes its direction.

158
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:56,910

159
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,070
Now, one thing that
we did not talk

160
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,920
about in the context of this
low Reynolds number motion

161
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,690
was the question of
how hard you would

162
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,660
have to pull in
order to get a cell

163
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
to go 30 microns per second.

164
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,270

165
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,440
Now, remember, we're in the
low Reynolds number regime,

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,767
where the force
you have to apply

167
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,600
is in general proportional
to this velocity.

168
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,050

169
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,740
And this thing is very
much not a sphere,

170
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,200
but if it were a sphere, for
a sphere, the proportionality

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,240
constant is this 6 pi eta
av, where a here is again

172
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,850
the radius.

173
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,050

174
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,710
Now, regardless of
the precise shape,

175
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,080
you'll always get for the low
Reynolds regime something that

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,620
looks vaguely like this, where
this is going to the longest

177
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,560
linear dimension and this here
depends on the precise geometry

178
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,250
of the object.

179
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,940

180
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,210
And so just-- it's
useful to try to get

181
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,760
a sense of order of magnitude.

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,030
How large are these forces
that we're talking about?

183
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,040
In particular,
how hard would you

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,079
have to pull a cell
in order to get

185
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,370
it to go 30 microns per second?

186
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,040

187
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,370
Now, of course then,
there's a question.

188
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,770
What's roughly the scale that
we should be thinking about?

189
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,730
Right now, a newton is the scale
that's for macroscopic objects.

190
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,870
So you'd say, OK, probably
not going to be up that large.

191
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,110
Then, on the other
scale, we can think

192
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,240
about the forces that
can be applied or exerted

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,330
by individual molecular motors.

194
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,450

195
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,644
Has anybody studied this at all?

196
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

197
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,380
JEFF GORE: Right,
order of picanewtons.

198
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,630
So force for a
molecular motor is going

199
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,108
to be of order picanewtons.

200
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,860

201
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,780
Now, there's a
simple way to kind of

202
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,870
get at why this might actually
be, because what is it

203
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,110
that powers many of
these molecular motors?

204
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,706
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

205
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,330
JEFF GORE: Yeah, so
it's often-- you're

206
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,470
thinking of maybe the motors
that operate in a membrane.

207
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,200
And then, there might
be some difference

208
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,660
in a gradient, so a
difference in concentration

209
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,410
across that membrane
and that can actually

210
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,609
power, for example, rotation.

211
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,150
We're going to talk
a little bit more

212
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,650
about this in the context
of the flagella motor,

213
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:51,370
because this is one of only
a few known rotary motors.

214
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,900
I'm just going to write this
down so that I don't forget

215
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,133
to say something about it.

216
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:58,300

217
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,610
But in this case--

218
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,294
AUDIENCE: ATP?

219
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,210
JEFF GORE: ATP, right?

220
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,190
So in many cases, what
happens is that you have,

221
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,280
for example, kinesin or myosin.

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,040
These are motors that walk along
some track and in many cases,

223
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,390
each step corresponds to a
single ATP being hydrolyzed.

224
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,880
And so given that,
there's some maximal force

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,540
that you can imagine
such a motor applying.

226
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,550
So for example-- and what
might it depend upon?

227
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,720

228
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,589
AUDIENCE: The energy of
ATP hydrolysis [INAUDIBLE]

229
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:36,630
JEFF GORE: Ah, very good.

230
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,474
So we have delta G for say, ATP.

231
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:42,390
And there's going to be
a length scale, right?

232
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,139
And what's going to
be the relevant length

233
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,878
scale in the case of, for
example, a motor like kinesin?

234
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:49,392
AUDIENCE: The flagella, I guess?

235
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,850
JEFF GORE: Well, kinesin is
not walking along the flagella,

236
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,060
but in this case, kinesin is
walking along microtubules,

237
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,040
for example.

238
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,230
So you're right that
we need a length scale,

239
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,560
because this is going to have
some units of say, picanewton

240
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,770
nanometers-- oops,
that's an Nm--

241
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,070
and we want to get a picanewton
so we're going to need a length

242
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,495
scale to divide by, right?

243
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,480
AUDIENCE: So how long
you move each time?

244
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
JEFF GORE: That's right.

245
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,896
It's kind of the distance that
this thing's moving, right?

246
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,590
So indeed, what happens
in the case of kinesin

247
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,480
is that they take steps
with what are called "heads"

248
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,700
but we can think of them
as "feet" if we want.

249
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,660
So each step is in this
case eight nanometers.

250
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,760
For example, delta L for kinesin
is equal to eight nanometers.

251
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,510
You don't need to know
this, but just it's

252
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,025
useful to have some
sense of scale.

253
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,660

254
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,320
Now, of course,
delta G of ATP, this

255
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,210
depends upon the concentrations
of the reactants,

256
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,420
of the products, and so forth.

257
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,320
But this thing might be of
order 100 picanewton nanometers.

258
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,234

259
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,900
Now, depending on
conditions, maybe it's

260
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,330
70, but of order here.

261
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,980
And indeed, what
this tells us is

262
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,280
that just based on what
we've said right now, even

263
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,140
without building any fancy
microscopes to measure

264
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,200
how much force these
things can apply,

265
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,957
you can see that the maximum
force it could possibly apply

266
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:24,040
would be something on the
order of delta G divided

267
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,203
by the length that it's pulling.

268
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:28,750

269
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,590
Otherwise, you could make
a perpetual motion machine.

270
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,430
So this-- well,
maybe what we'll do

271
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,149
if we want to make
our math simpler,

272
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,440
we could say this is around 80.

273
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
It's of order there.

274
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,700
But the point is that this
is of order 10 picanewtons,

275
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
so it's kind of
picanewton scale.

276
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,471

277
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,004
All right.

278
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:52,420
So given this, it's interesting
to ask, how hard would you

279
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,540
have to pull?

280
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,540
So how big is a kinesin model
going to be, this protein?

281
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,715

282
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,090
AUDIENCE: About
eight nanometers.

283
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,350
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right,
about eight nanometers.

284
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,183
Of course, it's kind
of long, spindly things

285
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,330
like my skinny legs,
right, but let's

286
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,710
indeed going to be
around that scale,

287
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,970
whereas the cell is one micron
wide, multiple microns long, so

288
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,210
much, much larger.

289
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,655
We'll draw a little--
here's a kinesin in there.

290
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:24,650

291
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,350
It's even smaller than that.

292
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,704
Kinesin's small.

293
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,620
Now, the question is,
how much force would you

294
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,420
have to apply in order to
pull an E. coli at 30 microns

295
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,970
a second?

296
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,530
Force to pull E.
coli at the speed

297
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,470
that it's actually
observed to go-- now,

298
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,260
you're unlikely to be able to
do the calculation right here.

299
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,450
It's actually a
simple calculation.

300
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,340
We could do it in
a moment, but it's

301
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,270
useful to just kind of imagine
what scale might it be.

302
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:15,110

303
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,970
All right, this is a way of--
we can go up as high as we want.

304
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,215
You can continue it on and this
is all in units of picanewtons.

305
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:26,010

306
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,040
Once again, it's
useful to make guesses

307
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,540
about your intuition
on these things

308
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,591
just so you have some
notion of where we might be.

309
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:37,090
And of course, in this case,
nobody wants to guess anything,

310
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,600
because they feel--
all right, I'll

311
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,867
give you 10 seconds just
to make your best guess.

312
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,200
Somebody's forcing you to do it.

313
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,435
In this case, it's me.

314
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:51,040

315
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,820
No reason that you actually
should necessarily get this.

316
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,244

317
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,160
Pulling through water.

318
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,980

319
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,160
AUDIENCE: At 30 microns.

320
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,660
JEFF GORE: At 30
microns per second.

321
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,978

322
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:15,380
AUDIENCE: Could you
give us the viscosity

323
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,850
of water in picanewtons?

324
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,340
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
10 to the minus nine

325
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,742
in the units of picanewton
nanometer second something.

326
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,252
AUDIENCE: Great.

327
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:24,960
JEFF GORE: Right.

328
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,740
Now, I've given you enough time.

329
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,600
You should have just
been able-- now,

330
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm going to be disappointed
if you don't get it right.

331
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,879
No.

332
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,494

333
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,660
Let's just see where we are.

334
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,290
Ready?

335
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,780
Three, two, one.

336
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,960
OK, so I'd say that we
have a bunch of-- I'd say

337
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,730
the mean is kind of a C-D-ish.

338
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,570
We got some A-B's.

339
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,340
All right, so I'd say it's
somewhere in the sense of,

340
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,700
yeah, maybe it's 100,000.

341
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,220
So maybe if you had 100 of these
kinesins pulling you along,

342
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,676
then you'd be able to go 30
microns a second, although you

343
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,430
have to be careful because
kinesin can't actually

344
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,020
go that fast.

345
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,900
But these are details, right?

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,260
No, there's a
reasonable question.

347
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,740
How hard would you have to pull.

348
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,473
Of course, if we want,
we could actually just

349
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:16,740
do the equations here, right?

350
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,891
The force, it's around 20.

351
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:21,599
In units of picanewton
nanometer seconds,

352
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,339
I told you that the eta is
around 10 to the minus 9.

353
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:25,839
All right.

354
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,130
And the radius, what
radius do you want to use?

355
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,950
AUDIENCE: A micron.

356
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,940
JEFF GORE: A micron.

357
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,580
So do we write a 1 here?

358
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,570
Do we write what?

359
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,550
10 to the 3 because
I already told you

360
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,890
that this was in units where
everything is picanewtons

361
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,180
nanometers seconds.

362
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,580
And velocity, this
is again per second.

363
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,740
So this is three times 10 to
the 4, because that's how many

364
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,770
nanometers per second.

365
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,489
And this gets us to around--
that's 10 to the seven.

366
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,030
We're going to have
to divide by 100,

367
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:05,627
so this is 60 divided by 100--
so less than a picanewton.

368
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,490

369
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,430
So this is really
pretty surprising.

370
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,090
And again, this is a reflection
of the wonders of low Reynolds

371
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,300
numbers kind of behavior.

372
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,278
So it's somewhere here.

373
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:24,080

374
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,580
Yes?

375
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,540
AUDIENCE: So since
there are many flagella,

376
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,970
is it telling us--
[INAUDIBLE] is it telling us

377
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,910
that they're very inefficient
compared to the [INAUDIBLE]

378
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,785
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
a good question, right?

379
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,650
So I think there
are several ways.

380
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,690
And this is one
aspect maybe of what

381
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,610
we read about in the "Life
at Low Reynolds Numbers."

382
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,240
The comparison was to a
Datsun in Saudi Arabia.

383
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,250
Of course, I think that this
was written in the '70s where

384
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,280
that meant something.

385
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,850
But I think that a Datsun, I
guess, is a fuel efficient car?

386
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,430

387
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,570
Well, that was my
inference from that.

388
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,830
And Saudi Arabia has a
lot of oil, still true.

389
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,320

390
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,060
And the saying was that it might
only be 1% efficient or so,

391
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,560
right?

392
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,760
But if you don't have to
apply very much force there,

393
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,120
then maybe that's
not a disaster.

394
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,859
The swimming speed
is not actually

395
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,900
a super strong function
of the number of flagella

396
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,691
that are there, as far
as my understanding.

397
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:30,200
So I'm actually a little
bit-- there are cases

398
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,060
where you do get somewhat
higher speed with more flagella,

399
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,050
although I have to confess,
just from the geometry

400
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,280
of the multiple flagella I find
totally mystifying, because I

401
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,290
would've thought they
would get tangled up,

402
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,519
because each of them goes in
and they form a corkscrew.

403
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,060
I don't know.

404
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,768
It just doesn't seem
that it should work.

405
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:50,040

406
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,161
But it does, so I'm not going
to argue that it doesn't.

407
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,047
AUDIENCE: Probably it has to do
with the low Reynolds number.

408
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,940
So you imagine swimming,
sort of flying around.

409
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,949
JEFF GORE: Yeah, no,
my concern is not even

410
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,740
a matter of the low
Reynolds number or not.

411
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,940
It's just a matter of
they're each spinning

412
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,810
and then-- this is something
really I've never understood,

413
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,240
so I typically avoid
talking about it.

414
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,460

415
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,332
I don't know.

416
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,040
I just feel like
there's something wrong.

417
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,490
But in any case, you don't
need to pull very hard in order

418
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,590
to get even a micron-size
object to go rather fast.

419
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,901

420
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes?

421
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

422
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,300

423
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,210
JEFF GORE: Oh, I'm
not aware of it.

424
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,410
This thing can actually
go-- it's 10 microns long,

425
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,020
so this thing is huge, actually.

426
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,580
But I--

427
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,163
AUDIENCE: It's
probably just a repeat.

428
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:52,927

429
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,859
Or even if it is
a repeat, you can

430
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,308
[INAUDIBLE] I'd
just be surprised

431
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:58,740
if it wasn't, since
it seems like that.

432
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,120
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
so I don't know,

433
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,072
but I'm not even sure if
that would necessarily

434
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,030
address my concern, which
is it seems like they

435
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,480
have to go through each other.

436
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,530
But it's not true, so I don't
want to make the argument too

437
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,350
strongly.

438
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,030
Did you have a question?

439
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,973
AUDIENCE: So I was just
thinking about this [INAUDIBLE]

440
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:20,410
Might it be possible that
they, if they are all sync up

441
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,360
their rotations, then it doesn't
matter how tangled they are?

442
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,390
JEFF GORE: Yeah, no,
even-- even if they're all

443
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,030
spinning at the exact
same rate, I still

444
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,690
feel that they
should get tangled,

445
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,960
but it's a feeling that
is apparently not true.

446
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,514
So I don't want to--

447
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:41,570
AUDIENCE: But if they're always
tumbling, maybe the time to--

448
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,370
JEFF GORE: No, no, no,
wait-- so it's not-- no,

449
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,076
the tumble is not due to
my supposed mechanism.

450
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,950
They're spinning at
something like 100 hertz.

451
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,120
The motors are spinning at
something like 100 hertz,

452
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,290
right?

453
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,290
So in principle, if they
were going to get tangled,

454
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,498
they would've gotten tangled.

455
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:57,700
AUDIENCE: Seems [INAUDIBLE]

456
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,283
JEFF GORE: That's
right, that's right.

457
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:04,042

458
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,500
I do want to just
come back and say

459
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,120
one thing about this
question of a rotary motor,

460
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,108
because it's a fascinating
question-- oh yes, go ahead.

461
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:12,983
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I just
had a quick question.

462
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,290
What was the units of eta again?

463
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,267
JEFF GORE: Oh,
this is the thing.

464
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,100
The units of eta, I
always just go back here

465
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,558
and I say, OK,
well, it's the units

466
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,890
of a force divided by unit of
an area-- or sorry, of a radius,

467
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,890
unit of a velocity, and then
I have to plug everything in.

468
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,780
And then, I have to find an
equation with a force other

469
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,670
than this equation, because if
you put this equation back in,

470
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,836
then you don't get anywhere.

471
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:43,332

472
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:44,040
These are useful.

473
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,420

474
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,760
So I always have to actually
figure it out fresh each time.

475
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,100

476
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,710
So it turns out that these
are indeed rotary motors.

477
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,380
And I think that this was
actually the first-- as far

478
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,760
as I'm aware, it's the first
example of a rotary motor

479
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,320
in biology that had
been demonstrated,

480
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,520
which is a fascinating idea
because in human engineering,

481
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,535
rotary motors are everywhere.

482
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,390

483
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,630
Yet somehow, if you
look at living things,

484
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,120
they don't seem to
have rotary motors.

485
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Now, anybody want to suggest
why rotary motors might be rare

486
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,210
in biology, in life?

487
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,210
AUDIENCE: Rotary is just
that it rotates, right,

488
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,575
not in terms of a mechanism
[INAUDIBLE] because there's

489
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:49,129
also [INAUDIBLE]

490
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:51,420
JEFF GORE: Well, I guess I'm
thinking of something that

491
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,580
can continuously rotate, right?

492
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:59,140
It's true that if you look
at-- we have ball socket joints

493
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,240
and I can rotate them a
little bit, but certainly,

494
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,294
I can't go-- there
are limits, right?

495
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:06,960
And this is a pretty
striking difference

496
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,730
between human engineering
and biological engineering.

497
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,094

498
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:14,594
Yeah?

499
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:17,975
AUDIENCE: If you tried to
connect anything across this,

500
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,270
it would be more [INAUDIBLE]

501
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,270
JEFF GORE: That's right.

502
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

503
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,560
JEFF GORE: That's right.

504
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,750
The problem is you
just can't have

505
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,958
anything connected across it.

506
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,420
Otherwise, you really
do get tangled, right?

507
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,430
Now, the question
then is, well, why

508
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,020
is it that it's possible
to do that here then?

509
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,145

510
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:38,020
AUDIENCE: Because we're
at such a small scale

511
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,583
that we're not thinking of
connecting anything else.

512
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,421
We're individual
molecules, anyway.

513
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:45,214
There's nothing that
can go through that.

514
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,630
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
it's interesting.

515
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,470
And this is how I think
about it that well,

516
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,940
at the molecular scale, you
just have some rotary something

517
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,520
and it doesn't
have to be attached

518
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,590
via, say, covalent
bonds or whatnot.

519
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,960
And you can then force
something to rotate.

520
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,540
Of course, it's a little
bit funny because this issue

521
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,090
about connecting across
this rotation, that

522
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,780
should be a problem for
human engineering, as well,

523
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,330
but somehow, we
do get around it.

524
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,100
I guess what I would
say is I don't have

525
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,140
any comments, except for this
was then quite a surprise when

526
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,010
it was discovered that this was
a rotor motor, just because we

527
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,130
had not seen any in other
macroscopic living things.

528
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,270
So then, it was quite
exciting to see it

529
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,470
in the case of the
flagellar motor.

530
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,490
And in your book,
you'll see that there's

531
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,000
a very nice kind of EM
reconstruction of this motor

532
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,610
and you can see how
it's hinged and it's

533
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,520
powered by proton gradients
that kind of cause this thing

534
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,030
to rotate.

535
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,933
It's really a beautiful,
amazing thing.

536
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,591

537
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,930
Does anybody know any other
examples of rotary motors?

538
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,500

539
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,310
That's right.

540
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,650
The other really famous one
is the F0F1 ATP synthase,

541
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,240
which is, again, something
that's across a membrane

542
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,130
and has, once again, a really
beautiful structure where

543
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,482
it has this circular thing
in the membrane that rotates,

544
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,065
responds to, again,
a proton gradient,

545
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:16,040
and then that drives
rotation of this other part

546
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,320
of the protein, F1.

547
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,730
And then, that makes ATP.

548
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,840
And that motor is amazing
also because it's reversible,

549
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,550
in that the cell can also
burn ATP and drive a proton

550
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,490
gradient.

551
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,085
And indeed, in some
single-molecule experiments,

552
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:35,460
they've even done
something where

553
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:42,040
they attached a little
magnetic particle onto this F1

554
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,050
and then rotated themselves.

555
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,530
And they showed that they
could actually make ATP.

556
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,780

557
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,720
The efficiency was maybe not
great, something like that,

558
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,700
because they're rotating
a macroscopic magnet

559
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,670
and then they're
making ATPs there.

560
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,390
But it's a pretty
remarkable aspect

561
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,620
of these molecular motors.

562
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,820
Now in this class,
we're not going

563
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,870
to say anything more
about molecular motors,

564
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,520
but I just wanted to mention
a few things about them

565
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,590
because they're really
fun, beautiful things

566
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,494
and there are other
classes that are

567
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,952
at MIT that may give you an
opportunity to think about them

568
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:19,680
some more.

569
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,520

570
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,675
Any question about
where we are now?

571
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:26,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

572
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,740

573
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,158
JEFF GORE: The common motor?

574
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

575
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,320
JEFF GORE: Oh.

576
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,030
Well, I'd say that the
other class of motors

577
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,930
that are seen a
lot in the context

578
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,850
of these molecular
motors are motors that

579
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,140
travel along linear tracks.

580
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,400
So there's kinesin that
walks along microtubules.

581
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,780
There are various myosins
that walk on actin.

582
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,040
And then, of course,
DNA and RNA polymerase,

583
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,748
we don't normally
think of them as motors

584
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:58,820
but indeed, they
take an energy fuel

585
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,780
and then they have to
walk along the template

586
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,600
as they make either
the DNA or the RNA.

587
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,540
So I'd say there are many, many
examples of molecular motors

588
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,260
that convert chemical
energy into mechanical force

589
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,200
and motion, particularly
along one-dimensional tracks.

590
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,780
So those, I think, are the
most well-studied examples.

591
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:33,250

592
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,630
Now, one way to study
this run and tumble motion

593
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,560
is, of course, to
actually apply a gradient

594
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,620
and then watch the
cells as they swim it.

595
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,966
And that has been done.

596
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,840
A lot's been learned
from that kind of assay,

597
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,020
but it turns out that there
are two other assays that maybe

598
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,610
allowed for more
controlled analysis

599
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,580
of this chemotaxis
kind of response.

600
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,860
So let's just say-- so
studying chemotaxis.

601
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,550

602
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,930
The most obvious thing
is to apply a gradient

603
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,660
and then watch.

604
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,050

605
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,310
And indeed, the
classic assays where

606
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:25,550
you add a little pipette with
an attractant or a repellent

607
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,840
and watch the bacteria
swim toward or away,

608
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,379
that demonstrates there
is indeed chemotaxis.

609
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,170
But it's a little bit
difficult to quantify

610
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,540
that process in many cases.

611
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,095
What are the assays that maybe
you've read about recently?

612
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:51,740

613
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,200
In [? Yuri's ?] book, how is
it that they actually analyzed

614
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
this perfect adaptation?

615
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,710

616
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,210
Yes?

617
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,530
AUDIENCE: So you can bind the
flagella on the slide and then

618
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,470
[INAUDIBLE]

619
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,570
JEFF GORE: So one thing
that you can do is you can--

620
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,410
I may put it here.

621
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:12,910
All right.

622
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,695
So you can kind of attach
the cell to a slide.

623
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:22,900

624
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,275
And typically attach it
to the slide by what?

625
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:30,480

626
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,350
This isn't it.

627
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,465
And does it matter where you
attach the cell to the slide?

628
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,830
AUDIENCE: By the flagella.

629
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,530
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
so you typically

630
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,488
have attach it via this
hook that's at the end,

631
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:41,050
so by some part of the
flagella-- to the slide

632
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,190
by the flagella, we'll say.

633
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,010
Flagellum?

634
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,600
Flagella-- whatever.

635
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,430
And the nice thing there is that
as the cell is doing its thing

636
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,010
and it's spinning either
clockwise or counterclockwise,

637
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,760
you can directly visualize
that because the whole cell is

638
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,510
moving.

639
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,710
And the cell is both the
thing that is doing the work

640
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,560
and processing the
signals and everything,

641
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,270
but it's also your
marker for what the state

642
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,910
of this little hook is, right?

643
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,400
This is a wonderfully
quantitative assay where you

644
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
can get high time resolution.

645
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,560
It's easy to do
the image analysis.

646
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,267
And then, how do you typically
get this cell to change its,

647
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,600
for example, tumbling frequency?

648
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,034

649
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:36,516
AUDIENCE: Put an attractant.

650
00:31:36,516 --> 00:31:38,637
JEFF GORE: Right, so you
can add an attractant.

651
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,970
And indeed, I just wanted to
separate this a little bit,

652
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,997
because you can-- even
without doing this--

653
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:45,080
this is kind of the next
order step-- you can just

654
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:53,390
add an attractant and
mix, because you don't

655
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,440
want the spatial patterns.

656
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,425
But a nice thing here,
this is a gradient in space

657
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:01,900
and then you can watch
the bacteria swim.

658
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,920
But you can also have
the gradient in time.

659
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,665
And the cells can't
tell the difference.

660
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,540
The nice thing here is
that you can then just

661
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,810
add the attractant,
mix, and then

662
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,730
you just watch all the
cells as they're going.

663
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,665
You don't need to try to
follow them or whatnot,

664
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,290
but you can just look to see how
the tumbling frequency changes

665
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:16,790
over time.

666
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,590

667
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,340
And of course, you would
typically use this trick

668
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,192
together with this in order to
study perfect adaptation and so

669
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:28,330
forth.

670
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,890
If you collect this sort of
data and you plot the tumbling

671
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:43,560
frequency as a function of
time, what you might see

672
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,410
is that it starts out
at one per second.

673
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,800

674
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:02,845
Now, if at this time,
I add an attractant,

675
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:06,350
does the tumbling
frequency go up or down?

676
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,940
And we're going to
do a verbal answer.

677
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,439
Ready?

678
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:10,286
Three, two, one.

679
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:10,910
AUDIENCE: Down.

680
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,860
JEFF GORE: Down.

681
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,900
And that makes sense
because the cells

682
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,750
think that they're moving
up an attractant gradient.

683
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:23,550
So over a very short time scale,
tumbling frequency goes down.

684
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:31,320
But then, over a time
scale of minutes--

685
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,090
it might be 5, 10 minutes--
that tumbling frequency

686
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,900
goes back to where it started.

687
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,360
I just want to--
this varies, but this

688
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,670
could be order of 10 minutes.

689
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,198
AUDIENCE: Why is it so long?

690
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,590
JEFF GORE: Yeah.

691
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,690
AUDIENCE: 10 minutes
is a very long time.

692
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,380
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
a long time scale.

693
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,880
And here's a question.

694
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,530
Is it because this
is the time that it

695
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,500
takes to make new protein?

696
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:06,606

697
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:07,980
New protein
synthesis, we'll say.

698
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:20,277

699
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:22,026
AUDIENCE: You're asking
if that's the time

700
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,150
or if that's the
reason why is it long?

701
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,080

702
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,760
JEFF GORE: I'm saying is this
the explanation for why this

703
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,020
is 10 minutes,
because the cell has

704
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,550
to go make new protein
in order to do this?

705
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,695

706
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:43,320
So the cell is presumably going
to be making some new proteins,

707
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,489
but is this what
you would really

708
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,800
describe as being the causative
agent of this thing taking 10,

709
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,540
20 minutes?

710
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,130
Ready?

711
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,790
Three, two, one.

712
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,631

713
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,130
All right.

714
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,260
So I'd say most people are
agreeing that actually,

715
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,750
yes, it is.

716
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,700
The answer is no.

717
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,929
This is not.

718
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:09,220
It may be the case that the
cell is making new protein,

719
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,000
but this is not what's
setting the time scale there.

720
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,920

721
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,000
Is--

722
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,824
AUDIENCE: More [INAUDIBLE]

723
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:22,010
JEFF GORE: Right.

724
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,320
You agreed that that was the
answer, but you didn't-- well,

725
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,760
so I would say there are several
ways you can think about this,

726
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,400
but we're going to go through
the model that is supported

727
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,566
by, I think, a fair amount
of experimental evidence.

728
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:36,440
But the key feature there
is that in this model,

729
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,210
it works even if all the
protein concentrations are

730
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,780
constant over time.

731
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,790
So everything that's
happening in this network

732
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,150
is happening as a
result of changes

733
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,370
of the states of the protein.

734
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,350
So proteins are either getting
methylated or phosphorylated

735
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,620
and these-- right.

736
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,350

737
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,100
But then, of course,
it's the question of,

738
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,980
why is it 10 minutes instead
of 10 seconds or a minute?

739
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,960
AUDIENCE: You need a
[INAUDIBLE] in there

740
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,167
that's on the order of minutes,
like 100 minutes, which

741
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:14,900
is very slow.

742
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,760
Is there--

743
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,300
JEFF GORE: Yeah, well,
their one question is, this

744
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,850
is what is called
the adaptation time.

745
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,890
Now, is this a robust
feature in this model

746
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,496
or in the cells,
for that matter?

747
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:37,600

748
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,910
We'll just add
verbal, yes or no.

749
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,520
Ready?

750
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,939
Three, two, one,

751
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:43,480
AUDIENCE: No.

752
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,063
JEFF GORE: No.

753
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:46,510

754
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,570
Now, and what that
means is that indeed,

755
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,860
different kind of
versions of this network

756
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,450
will have different times.

757
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,930
And there is data looking
at variation in this

758
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,890
between different cells.

759
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,960
And I guess I don't have
a clear feeling for what

760
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
would be optimal, in the sense
of allowing optimal climbing up

761
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,620
of an attractant gradient.

762
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,920
This thing has to be much
longer than the typical times

763
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,660
for a tumble.

764
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,980
Otherwise, it's
not even-- well, we

765
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,440
wouldn't have been able
to measure it, I guess.

766
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,279
But I agree that it could
have been one minute

767
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,695
and I wouldn't
have batted an eye,

768
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,778
in the sense that I don't
have any feeling for why

769
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:34,720
it had to have been
this or something else.

770
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,312
But somebody who
actually studies this

771
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:37,895
might be able to
give a better answer.

772
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:44,080

773
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,231
All right.

774
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,636
AUDIENCE: But I guess--
sorry, just one last thing.

775
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:49,580
My question is not
why it's 10 minutes.

776
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,500
It's not an
evolutionary question,

777
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,900
like why is it useful, right?

778
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,020
It's just somehow, [INAUDIBLE]

779
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,959
JEFF GORE: Yeah I
think that there

780
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,500
are different ways
of looking at this

781
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,208
and then depending on
how you look at it,

782
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,050
you either feel
surprised or not.

783
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:15,520
So it's a little--
now on the other hand,

784
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,980
if you had added
a repellent, then

785
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,135
the tumbling frequency
would actually go up

786
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:21,340
and then come back down.

787
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,087
But the key, key
thing in this system

788
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,670
that we want to focus
our attention on

789
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,810
is the fact that it comes
back to where it started.

790
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,980
So it's the fact that I can
draw this dashed line that

791
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,245
is this perfect adaptation.

792
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:52,310

793
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,349
And so what we want
to do is understand

794
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:56,140
where this phenomenon
of perfect adaptation

795
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,829
comes from and maybe why
it is robust to changes

796
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:03,620
in, for example, the
concentrations of some

797
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,369
of these proteins.

798
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:08,100

799
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,320
Now, let's just
make sure that we're

800
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,920
all on the same page in
terms of what was known

801
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,280
about this chemotaxis network.

802
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,150
And I think it's worth
mentioning, perhaps, here

803
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,070
that the whole series of
studies of bacterial chemotaxis

804
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,010
going back to Howard
Berg and company

805
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,130
and then later, the
studies that in robustness

806
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,370
that Uri Alon and Stan
Leibler and Naama Barkai did.

807
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,730
I think they represent really
just a wonderfully beautiful

808
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,740
exploration at the interface
between physics and biology.

809
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,790
I think you could teach
an entire course just

810
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,400
on bacterial chemotaxis and
you could hit pretty much

811
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,530
all the major themes in
biophysics over the last 40

812
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,300
years.

813
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,876
It's really amazing to me.

814
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,750
I myself have not done
any work in the field,

815
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,090
but from afar, I've really
just admired the beauty

816
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,860
of all these studies.

817
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,225
And because you go back
to Howard Berg and Purcell

818
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:12,910
and they're thinking about
how simple physics can inform

819
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,340
the challenges that
bacteria are facing

820
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,790
and how cells are actually
able to do a biased random walk

821
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,300
and get anywhere, limits on
sensing both concentrations

822
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,250
and gradients-- and
then later, the studies

823
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,360
that they're this
topic of robustness,

824
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,990
it's really a
wonderful example where

825
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,770
Naama Barkai, when she was
a postdoc at Stan Leibler,

826
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,097
they had published a Nature
paper in maybe '97 basically

827
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:41,680
saying, this idea of robustness
is really important in biology

828
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,260
and in order to have a robust
response of perfect adaptation,

829
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,130
a model has to have
these features.

830
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,170
So there's no experiments
there, but their model

831
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,810
was guided by
previous observations

832
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,320
that people had made.

833
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,990
And then, two years
later, Uri, when

834
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,290
he was a postdoc in
Stan's lab again,

835
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,510
did kind of the
experimental confirmation

836
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,431
of the model, where
he went in and he

837
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,972
controlled the
concentration of chi R

838
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:11,080
and showed that thee key
predictions of the model, i.e.

839
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,140
the perfect adaptation, would
be robust to the concentration

840
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,390
but that the tumbling frequency
and the adaptation time, they

841
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,224
would not be robust to
chi R concentrations.

842
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:20,640
They would move
in a way predicted

843
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,879
by the model and all that.

844
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,170
It's really amazing that it
all kind of holds together,

845
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,860
because in many cases, we do
the modeling kind of post facto,

846
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,360
right?

847
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,280
And then, it's kind of
explaining our results.

848
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,216
But the case where a
model is really useful

849
00:41:36,216 --> 00:41:38,090
is when it makes new
predictions that get you

850
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,940
to go make new measurements.

851
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,385
And this is a
situation where there

852
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:46,010
are an infinite number of
experiments that you could do,

853
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,770
but only some of them
will actually provide you

854
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,610
a deep insight into
the mechanisms that

855
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,000
are going on in the system.

856
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,650
And I think this was a real
case where the models made

857
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,550
some really clear predictions
and that allowed, in this case,

858
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,742
Uri to go and make the strains
that allowed him to test

859
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:02,950
the predictions of the model.

860
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,330
And I think it's really amazing
that it all kind of works.

861
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:07,830
All right.

862
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,670
Now, all of the letters
that you see up there,

863
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,190
they're not actually-- well,
first of all, the letters

864
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,840
are somehow real.

865
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,280
This is the real names
of the protein components

866
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,160
in the chemotaxis
network in E. coli

867
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,350
and largely in other organisms.

868
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:29,190
But in each case, there's a
chi that comes in front, right?

869
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,690
So R corresponds to
chi R, for example.

870
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,940
And then, there's
chi B, chi W, chi A.

871
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,640
And these were all identified
by genetics, so then

872
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,890
by researchers looking
for mutants that

873
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,620
were defective in chemotaxis.

874
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,586
I don't know what
happened to C, D, E, F, G,

875
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,210
because it does seem like we got
the first part of the alphabet

876
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,626
and the last part
of the alphabet.

877
00:42:55,626 --> 00:42:57,910

878
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,024
I don't know.

879
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,010
All right.

880
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,820
Now, the basic
idea in the system

881
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:11,810
is that you have chi W/A that
we often here will refer to as X

882
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,290
just for simplicity.

883
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,800
Now, these are proteins
in the membrane,

884
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,700
so they have a binding
kind of pocket outside

885
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,640
that will allow binding of
attractants or repellents.

886
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,390
There might be say,
five different kinds

887
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,530
of these receptor
complexes that can sense,

888
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,160
that bind at different rates,
different kinds of attractants,

889
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,410
repellents, and then the
signal is somehow integrated.

890
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,690

891
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,950
Now, this could be either an
attractant or a repellant.

892
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,900
The distinction
between these two

893
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,440
is that we get different
levels of methylation

894
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,008
onto chi W. Now in
this lecture, we're

895
00:43:57,008 --> 00:43:59,250
only going to be talking
about the methylated state

896
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,070
versus the unmethylated.

897
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,860
But in reality, depending on
the receptor complex they have,

898
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,460
they might have four or five
different methylation sites.

899
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,290
And this ability to switch
between different methylation

900
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,920
states is really at the
heart of the phenomenon

901
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,390
of robust perfect adaptation.

902
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,960

903
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,415
The base feature in it, though,
is that chi A can phosphorylate

904
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:30,840
chi Y and chi Y will then
go and yield the output,

905
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,084
which is in this case,
increased tumbling frequency.

906
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:38,000
But there are lots of
other bells and whistles

907
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,490
that you can see on here, right?

908
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,520
So of course, it's not just
that this phosphorylated

909
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,510
chi Y just kind of
comes off on its own,

910
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,080
but rather it's
actually done by chi Z.

911
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,971
So there's a
constant cycling here

912
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:52,720
and again, there's a
constant cycling here

913
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,300
where the methyl groups are
taken off and then put back on.

914
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,950
So if you look at
this, you really

915
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,720
do feel that it's
rather wasteful,

916
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,910
because there's a huge number
of these futile cycles going on.

917
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,820
Chi Y is always kind of
being phosphorylated and then

918
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:12,670
dephosphorylated and this is all
going to be costly to the cell.

919
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,437
So you can imagine
then the only reason

920
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,520
it's there is because it's
doing something useful.

921
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,130

922
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,690
Now, there was a
comment in the chapter

923
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,520
about what is the rate
limiting step in all this.

924
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,300
And can somebody
remember what it was?

925
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:50,849

926
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:51,349
Yeah?

927
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,515
AUDIENCE: Is it methylation?

928
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:54,450

929
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,470
JEFF GORE: So methylation,
there is a sense

930
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,100
that that is actually
the longest time scale,

931
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,610
but I guess because
the methylation

932
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,300
is what results in
this thing coming

933
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,620
in the perfect adaptation
over this 10 minutes.

934
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,610
I guess what I meant-- so yeah,
that is the longest time scale.

935
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,860
But I guess what I was
thinking about in rate limiting

936
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,870
is the sense of when
the cell finds itself

937
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,140
in a new environment,
it changes its state

938
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,790
over a much shorter time scale.

939
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,720
So this thing I drew is
almost vertical, right?

940
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,640
So this question is, if
the cell finds itself

941
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,670
in a new environment suddenly
and then it just really

942
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,900
wants to tumble-- so you find
yourself in a crappy bar,

943
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,980
how long does it take
for you to get out?

944
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,693
Now, what's going to
be rate limiting there?

945
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:39,193
Yeah?

946
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:41,840
AUDIENCE: Phospho--
phosphorylation.

947
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,000
JEFF GORE:
Phosphorylation, yeah,

948
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,530
although it turns out that's
not the rate limiting step.

949
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,780
And this actually comes back
a little bit to something

950
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,170
that we talked about in
the first part of the class

951
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,590
that in these
transcription networks,

952
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,907
the characteristic
timescale is what?

953
00:46:58,907 --> 00:46:59,406
AUDIENCE: G.

954
00:46:59,406 --> 00:47:01,350
JEFF GORE: Right.

955
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,224
So the characteristic timescale
in the case of transcription

956
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:05,765
networks is the time
it takes for you

957
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:08,330
to change concentrations of
proteins, which is kind of cell

958
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,910
generation time or if you
have active degradation,

959
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,120
you might be able to make it
faster, whereas all of this

960
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,930
is happening rather
quickly, say,

961
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,540
maybe 1/10 tenth of a second.

962
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,434
And a lot of these kinds of
processes, binding, unbinding,

963
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:23,850
and actually even
the interactions

964
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,350
between the proteins
can take place

965
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,000
even maybe faster than that.

966
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,230
So the actual rate limiting step
for when the cell finds itself

967
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,357
in a bad environment
for it to start tumbling

968
00:47:34,357 --> 00:47:35,565
is actually due to diffusion.

969
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:36,820
And that's diffusion of what?

970
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,047

971
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:41,891
AUDIENCE: Y protein.

972
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,790
JEFF GORE: Yeah, diffusion of
the phosphorylated Y, right?

973
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:52,097
And that's because we
have the cells here.

974
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:53,930
They find themselves
in the bad environment.

975
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,670
They rapidly bind the
repellent or they quickly

976
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,350
phosphorylate chi
Y. But then, Y is

977
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,020
going to be formed
at one of the poles,

978
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,894
because actually, there's
actually clustering

979
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:08,260
of these receptors at
the poles of a cell

980
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,370
and incidentally, we're not
going to talk about that here,

981
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,880
but I think there's strong
experimental and theoretical

982
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,810
evidence that this actually
increases the sensitivity.

983
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:22,260
And indeed, people have used
simple Ising type models

984
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,710
to try to understand how the
coupling between the binding

985
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,530
of repellents on what's
essentially almost

986
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,410
like a crystalline
array of receptors

987
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,592
can allow the array
to better than you

988
00:48:33,592 --> 00:48:34,800
build it to as an individual.

989
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,580
We're not going to get into
that here, but in any case,

990
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,210
there's receptors
at the poles-- I

991
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,000
don't know if it's
both poles or one pole,

992
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,630
but one of the
poles of the other--

993
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,120
and that's where chi
Y is phosphorylated.

994
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,500
But then, you can see that
these flagella are distributed

995
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,400
all around the cell.

996
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
So you have to diffuse
from say, the pole

997
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,090
to the site of
the flagella motor

998
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,870
in order to cause it to go
clockwise and then cause

999
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,066
a tumble.

1000
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:06,565
Yeah?

1001
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:08,350
AUDIENCE: So do you
need only one motor?

1002
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,891
JEFF GORE: Yeah, so
you actually only

1003
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:13,298
need one motor to
get the tumbling.

1004
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:15,464
And so then, you may not
have to diffuse all the way

1005
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:19,600
to the other end, but-- and of
course, diffusion is random.

1006
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,350
And we all know that 0.1
seconds is around the time

1007
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,240
that it takes for a
protein-sized object

1008
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,580
to diffuse across the
volume of a bacterial cell.

1009
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,670
We did that calculation
a couple weeks ago.

1010
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,640
So 0.1 seconds is indeed--
so the rate limiting step

1011
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,620
is indeed this step
right here, which

1012
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:48,839
is diffusion of chi Y, the
phosphorylated version of it.

1013
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:54,680

1014
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,180
All right.

1015
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,290
Now, we may not get too
much into the models

1016
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,430
here, because you
did read about them.

1017
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,460
But I will just
kind of sketch out

1018
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,510
sort of what you might call
the fine-tuned model and then

1019
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,890
the key assumption that
goes into this robust model.

1020
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:22,100
Now, what both models
assume and indeed

1021
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,260
what was known
from previous work

1022
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:31,420
was that chi R is
present at small number.

1023
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,800
So chi R, there might be around
100 proteins in the cell.

1024
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,890

1025
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:47,170
And what does this mean
about the activity of chi R?

1026
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,880

1027
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,226
What is the other word for it?

1028
00:50:51,226 --> 00:50:52,975
It doesn't actually
have to quite mean it,

1029
00:50:52,975 --> 00:50:56,285
but what is it that-- how--

1030
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:57,332
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1031
00:50:57,332 --> 00:50:58,290
JEFF GORE: What's that?

1032
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,797
AUDIENCE: [? High ?] saturation.

1033
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:01,380
JEFF GORE: So yeah,
something is high.

1034
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:08,020
And what is typically assumed is
that chi R acts at saturation,

1035
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:17,940
chi R. But what do we mean by
"saturation" in these models?

1036
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,330

1037
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,112
AUDIENCE: Maximum.

1038
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:23,820
JEFF GORE: Right.

1039
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,980
Does it mean that
if we add more chi

1040
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,620
R than the rate of methylation,
it doesn't increase?

1041
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,269

1042
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:35,310
And I should have put a
little methyl group here.

1043
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:46,022

1044
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:47,480
There are multiple
things you might

1045
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,000
mean by "acts at saturation."

1046
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,800
And in the models that
you read about last night,

1047
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,300
is what it means that if we
increase the number of chi R

1048
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,090
that it doesn't change
the rate of methylation?

1049
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,630
Yes or no?

1050
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,130
Ready?

1051
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,329
Three, two, one.

1052
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:04,870
AUDIENCE: No.

1053
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,259
JEFF GORE: No.

1054
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,550
And what they mean is something
rather different, which

1055
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,235
is that if we plot or if
we calculate the change

1056
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:14,540
in the concentration
of the methylated X--

1057
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:19,980
now, we're calling this
whole thing Xm, methylated X,

1058
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,760
and this is just X.
The assumption is

1059
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:32,950
that we have X is
being methylated

1060
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:38,830
at a rate that is-- there's
no Michaelis-Menten term.

1061
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:43,215
If we were to write this
as it not being saturated,

1062
00:52:43,215 --> 00:52:44,090
what is it acting on?

1063
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:49,348

1064
00:52:49,348 --> 00:52:51,750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1065
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,370
JEFF GORE: Yeah, it's
not the methylated x.

1066
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,430
So indeed, if we
were to write this,

1067
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:03,220
we're assuming that this is
at saturation, as they say.

1068
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,105
But any time that you
see something like this,

1069
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:07,560
you have to ask,
well, what would

1070
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,166
be the alternative, right?

1071
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,790
And the alternative
would be to include

1072
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:16,030
a term that looks kind of like
just X over some K plus X,

1073
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:21,940
because R is acting
on the unmethylated X.

1074
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,200
We're not including that.

1075
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,490
What that means is that we're
assuming that this thing is

1076
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:32,520
saturated, that the
concentration of X to be acted

1077
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:38,077
on is significantly larger than
the Michaelis constant there.

1078
00:53:38,077 --> 00:53:40,160
And of course, this is
related to the amount of R,

1079
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,620
because as we get
more and more R,

1080
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:48,220
then eventually, we'll
remove some of this X

1081
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,160
and then we'll get into
the non-saturated regime.

1082
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,850
So these two statements
are related, but not

1083
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:54,620
the same thing.

1084
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:59,790

1085
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:07,420
Now, there's also some rate that
the phosphorylated version of B

1086
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,456
removes the methyl groups
and that's indeed just going

1087
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:14,705
to be this Michaelis constant.

1088
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:20,820

1089
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,410
And this is going to be
for the fine-tuned model.

1090
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,030

1091
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,730
The robust model
looks very similar,

1092
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:37,220
but this is the simplest kind
of manifestation of this model.

1093
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,380
Now, once we're
writing this down,

1094
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,890
it's useful to make
sure that we can

1095
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,420
keep track of what's
actually happening

1096
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,003
over the course of
perfect adaptation.

1097
00:54:44,003 --> 00:54:46,780

1098
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:52,170
So now, let's imagine first
that an attractant arrives.

1099
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,930

1100
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,490
That's going to change
the activity of X.

1101
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,380
And when we say
"activity," what we mean

1102
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:07,124
is the rate that's it's going
to phosphorylate both B and Y.

1103
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:09,290
So let's just make sure
that we know this direction.

1104
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,950
So we add an attractant.

1105
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:16,220

1106
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,111
We'll say "add."

1107
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:19,860
What does this do?

1108
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,575
Does it make activity
go up or down?

1109
00:55:22,575 --> 00:55:29,759

1110
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,300
I'll give you 15
seconds to make sure

1111
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,635
that you kind of understand
the workings of this network.

1112
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:39,420

1113
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:56,230
This is activity of X,
this complex X. All right.

1114
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,075
Do you need more time?

1115
00:55:59,075 --> 00:55:59,574
All right.

1116
00:55:59,574 --> 00:56:00,510
Let's see where we are.

1117
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,010
Ready?

1118
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,251
Three, two, one.

1119
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:05,750
All right.

1120
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,830
So we got a majority
of the group

1121
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,445
is saying that it
should go down.

1122
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:12,210

1123
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,420
Well, let's just
follow the logic.

1124
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,210
So we imagine an
attractant binding.

1125
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,740
If the activity goes
down, that means

1126
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,870
that we get less of
the phosphorylated chi

1127
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:28,450
Y. That means we get less
propensity to tumbling,

1128
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,536
which means that we
keep on going further.

1129
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:35,140
All right, that
sounds reasonable.

1130
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,466
Any questions about that logic?

1131
00:56:37,466 --> 00:56:39,006
Yes?

1132
00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:39,881
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1133
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:43,962

1134
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:44,670
JEFF GORE: Right.

1135
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,010
So we haven't said
anything yet about BM.

1136
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,920
That's what going
to happen next.

1137
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,725
And that's actually
the slow time scale.

1138
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:53,100
So what we had in
here is that we

1139
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,900
were kind of at this
steady-state tumbling

1140
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,100
frequency of one per second.

1141
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,190
We add an attractant.

1142
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:02,015
The tumbling frequency goes down
because of what we just said.

1143
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:04,140
But now, there's going to
be this longer time scale

1144
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,780
process whereby we
get recovery, where

1145
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,580
we come back to this
steady-state tumbling

1146
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,250
frequency.

1147
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:17,350
And that's going to
involve action on chi B.

1148
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:17,850
All right.

1149
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:24,510
So what happens is that
the attractant causes less

1150
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,680
of the phosphorylated
chi Y. But it's also

1151
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:36,990
going to cause less of the
phosphorylated chi B. Now, that

1152
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,294
means that we're going
to-- and remember,

1153
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:41,710
the phosphorylated
chi B is what's

1154
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,010
removing the methyl groups.

1155
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,670

1156
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,000
So if we have less
flux going to the left,

1157
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,427
but we have the
same-- at that moment,

1158
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,760
we don't have any change in
the flux going to the right.

1159
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,780
So chi R is still acting on the
same unmethylated X's that it

1160
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,670
was operating on before.

1161
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,700
So it's the same flux to the
right, less flux to the left.

1162
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:12,275
So there's a net accumulation of
the methylated receptor, which

1163
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:17,020
we are calling X. So the
key thing here is that--

1164
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,650
and it's this
methylated receptor that

1165
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,610
has more activity.

1166
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,697
In this model, this
unmethylated version actually

1167
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:26,780
doesn't have any activity.

1168
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,860

1169
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,000
So then, if we get more of the
methylated X, then over time,

1170
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,050
we get a buildup
of the methylated X

1171
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,267
and that causes the
activity to come back up.

1172
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:41,224

1173
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:42,640
Now, of course,
there's a question

1174
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,737
of-- I just said that
it comes back up,

1175
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:46,320
but I didn't say
that it comes back up

1176
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,430
exactly to its original
tumbling frequency.

1177
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:54,040
I didn't say that it necessarily
displays perfect adaptation.

1178
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,810
And that's because
in this model,

1179
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,870
the perfect adaptation
arises as a result of what

1180
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,500
we call fine-tuning,
because it only

1181
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,200
happens if all of the
parameters are just so.

1182
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,740
In Uri's book, he describes
a typical condition

1183
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,050
where that would be the case.

1184
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,690
And the problem is
that you can always

1185
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,260
fine-tune for some
concentrations of everything,

1186
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,720
chi R or chi this, chi that.

1187
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,430
But then if the
concentrations change,

1188
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,440
then you're no longer
fine-tuned correctly.

1189
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,200
You were fine-tuned
for a different world

1190
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,780
and now you're not-- and
that's the definition of being

1191
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,280
fine-tuned is that
if things change,

1192
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,446
you're no longer fine-tuned.

1193
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:31,380
You're just finely
off-tune, right?

1194
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,950
So this is the problem
with the fine-tuned model

1195
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,030
is that you can get
it right for a given--

1196
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,655
for given concentrations
of everything,

1197
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:41,030
you can always
find what numbers.

1198
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,010
This is VB and
then there's going

1199
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:49,960
to be-- you can talk about
the activities of XM given

1200
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,210
the previous attractant
concentration and so on and so

1201
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,030
forth, but it's not
going to be fine-tuned

1202
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,440
if you change
anything else, like

1203
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,356
if you change concentration
of R, for example.

1204
00:59:57,356 --> 01:00:00,440

1205
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,520
And I'm happy to
go through the math

1206
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,770
and so forth maybe after
class if anybody's curious,

1207
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:09,170
but it's really
precisely what Uri did,

1208
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,120
so maybe I won't
get into it now.

1209
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,000

1210
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,090
But the question
then is, well, how

1211
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,980
is it that you might
change this model in order

1212
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,475
to make it robust?

1213
01:00:20,475 --> 01:00:23,190

1214
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:29,850
And the change is somehow
surprisingly simple,

1215
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:33,510
which is that what you want
is chi B, instead of just

1216
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:38,260
acting on any old
methylated X, you

1217
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:43,982
want it to act only on
the methylated X that

1218
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:47,620
is in sort of in what we
would call this active state,

1219
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:54,610
where it's actually
able to catalyze

1220
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,000
either of those reactions.

1221
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,860
So the notion is that if you
have this methylated X, then

1222
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,682
it's kind of over a
very fast time scale.

1223
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:04,890
It's switching between what
we call an "active" state

1224
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:05,820
and some inactive one.

1225
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,720
And it's really only
in the active versions

1226
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,640
that chi B is able to act on
and remove the methyl group.

1227
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,730
And this is on the one
hand a clever thing

1228
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:23,650
that allows you to implement
this integral feedback.

1229
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,406
On the other hand, it's a little
bit of like pulling a bunny out

1230
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:30,970
of a hat, because you feel
like, well, these things may

1231
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,820
be happening over
microsecond time scales.

1232
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:38,230
It's hard to know exactly--
how would you actually

1233
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,160
experimentally confirm this
is precisely what's going on?

1234
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,960
And I think that here, it's a
little bit subtle because you

1235
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,900
could maybe show that indeed
the rate of this demethylation

1236
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,730
is proportional to
the activity here,

1237
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,591
but you don't
necessarily have access

1238
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:59,840
to all of the molecular
dynamics that are taking place

1239
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,920
over microsecond time scales.

1240
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,174
So I think that you can do
measurements that give you

1241
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:10,090
confidence that this is
maybe what's going on,

1242
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,550
but you can't quite
100% nail it because

1243
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,875
of the nature of these
molecular fluctuations.

1244
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:22,650

1245
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:33,765
So the idea there
is that if we say

1246
01:02:33,765 --> 01:02:35,140
that there's this
rapid shuttling

1247
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,510
between the so-called
"active" and "inactive"

1248
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,250
methylated guys-- so this
is indicating that it's

1249
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:47,230
what we call "active," able
to catalyze this and this--

1250
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,150
then this ends up
being equivalent

1251
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:53,619
to integral feedback,
where you'll always

1252
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:54,577
get perfect adaptation.

1253
01:02:54,577 --> 01:03:00,538

1254
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:01,038
Yeah?

1255
01:03:01,038 --> 01:03:05,020
AUDIENCE: When you
put [INAUDIBLE]

1256
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:08,340
JEFF GORE: So the idea is that
we imagine that we're this

1257
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,640
receptor X. It's chi W, chi A.
Now whether it's-- let's say

1258
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,280
it's bound to something.

1259
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,000
It still bound to an
attractant, right?

1260
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,697
The way that the attractant
influences its activity--

1261
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,530
and it has to influence
its activity if it's

1262
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,040
going to do anything--
what we assume

1263
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,699
is the way that it's doing
it is that it's changing

1264
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,240
the sort of fraction
of time that I'm

1265
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,020
in some active conformation
where I can actually do work,

1266
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,510
versus the inactive conformation
where I'm taking a break.

1267
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,260
So when you get the
attractant and you

1268
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,385
spend more of your time in
this active conformation

1269
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:43,510
where you're, in this case,
phosphorylating proteins,

1270
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,090
and that's sort of the
mechanism through which

1271
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,270
an attractant or a
repellent or whatnot

1272
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,897
actually transmits its signal.

1273
01:03:50,897 --> 01:03:52,355
And indeed, it has
to do something.

1274
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:57,910

1275
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,360
Nothing that we're
discussing would work at all

1276
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,700
if we don't allow the signal
to be transmitted somehow

1277
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,842
through this receptor.

1278
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,550
So there is this sense
that this activity

1279
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,990
has to be a function of
the things out there.

1280
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:15,530
And the assumption that goes
into the perfect adaptation

1281
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:22,220
is really that the
rate of demethylation

1282
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:28,445
is proportional to that
kind of active fraction.

1283
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:30,820
And then, you can argue about
how discrete these entities

1284
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,856
have to be in order for the
mechanism to work and so forth,

1285
01:04:33,856 --> 01:04:35,480
but certainly, there
has to be some way

1286
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,280
that binding to an attractant
leads to what we decided

1287
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,050
was less activity.

1288
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,951

1289
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:43,451
Yeah?

1290
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:44,784
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

1291
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:46,874
So what's the relationship
between activity

1292
01:04:46,874 --> 01:04:48,830
and methylation?

1293
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:49,808
Was it [INAUDIBLE]

1294
01:04:49,808 --> 01:04:54,210

1295
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,780
JEFF GORE: So the idea is that
we're typically maybe assuming

1296
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,330
that the unmethylated
guy has no activity,

1297
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:03,670
so it doesn't do any of
this phosphorylation,

1298
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,290
whereas the methylated
guy has some activity.

1299
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:12,710
And you can characterize
it by some rate of activity

1300
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,580
or some fraction
of the time that it

1301
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,118
is in this active state
that is doing something.

1302
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:24,770

1303
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,240
Now, the question--
and indeed this

1304
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:34,040
ends up-- well, you can see
here that in this model,

1305
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,020
because you're directly
acting on the active XM, then

1306
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,870
the steady-state
activity you can

1307
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:47,520
get from just setting this equal
to zero and it's some number.

1308
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,522

1309
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:51,980
But then, the
question is, how long

1310
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,650
does it take to come back
to that steady state?

1311
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,380
And that's where
we get differences

1312
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,610
as a function of
concentration of chi R,

1313
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,620
because what's
happening always is

1314
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:10,310
that we have some kind
of cycle here where

1315
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,930
chi B is removing
the methyl groups,

1316
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,020
groups chi R is
adding them back.

1317
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,160
So you can imagine that
if you have more chi

1318
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,412
R than a steady state, you get
more-- when you're moving right

1319
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,870
by a steady state,
you have to have

1320
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,078
the same moving to the left,
because at steady state,

1321
01:06:25,078 --> 01:06:25,910
it's equal.

1322
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:28,775
So the more chi R you
have, the faster this thing

1323
01:06:28,775 --> 01:06:31,860
is going around.

1324
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,190
And that means that the
more chi R that you have,

1325
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:40,250
the more rapidly that you'll
get this perfect adaptation.

1326
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:44,670
So the experiment that Uri
did that I think is very nice

1327
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,630
is he directly modulated
the amount of chi R

1328
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,350
and he looked at
this adaptation time.

1329
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:58,298

1330
01:06:58,298 --> 01:07:01,440
And he found this
kind of came down,

1331
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,860
whereas if you look at
the steady-state tumbling

1332
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:16,560
frequency, this came
up, whereas the degree

1333
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,510
of perfect adaptation,
say the ratio or the error

1334
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,700
in this thing,
perfect adaptation

1335
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:27,260
was always kind of correct, in
the sense it always came back

1336
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,390
to its original value.

1337
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:32,330

1338
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:33,800
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

1339
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:40,660
You say the [INAUDIBLE]
it only phosphorylates

1340
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:48,500
chi B when an
attractant [INAUDIBLE]

1341
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,907
Y [INAUDIBLE] attractant.

1342
01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:51,490
JEFF GORE: No.

1343
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,190
So the attractant
or repellent can

1344
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,690
be combined to
either the methylated

1345
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,898
or the non-methylated, right?

1346
01:07:55,898 --> 01:08:00,730
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
only [INAUDIBLE]

1347
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:05,027
phosphorylation of
chi B when [INAUDIBLE]

1348
01:08:05,027 --> 01:08:05,610
JEFF GORE: No.

1349
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:11,170
So you're talking
about-- oh, OK.

1350
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,730
So it's really that the
methylated state can

1351
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,649
phosphorylate either
chi B or chi Y,

1352
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:20,260
but this is regardless whether
an attractant is bound or not.

1353
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,859
The attractant will influence
the rate or the activity

1354
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:23,670
that this happens.

1355
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:35,979

1356
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:46,130
And given this model, you can
see that you have more chi R,

1357
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,910
then at steady state, you're
going to have more activity.

1358
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:54,510
More activity corresponds
to more phosphorylated chi

1359
01:08:54,510 --> 01:09:00,261
y and more tumbling,
so an increase

1360
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,344
in the tumbling frequency.

1361
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,487

1362
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:04,987
Yes?

1363
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:06,670
AUDIENCE: I guess
it's not clear to me

1364
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,108
where the ligand concentration
actually come in.

1365
01:09:09,108 --> 01:09:10,649
JEFF GORE: Where
which concentration?

1366
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:12,107
AUDIENCE: The ligand
concentration.

1367
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,300
JEFF GORE: Oh, OK, yeah.

1368
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,441
AUDIENCE: Because
that's what [INAUDIBLE]

1369
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:17,399
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right.

1370
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,279
Yeah, so the idea here
is that if we start out

1371
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:24,890
without any attractant--
so first of all,

1372
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,020
so let's imagine
we're at steady state.

1373
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,210
There's no attractant
or little attractant

1374
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,859
now, where of course, the
fluxes to the left and the right

1375
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:32,460
are the same.

1376
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,029
So there's some
methylated, some not.

1377
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:37,692
AUDIENCE: No, but I agree the
mechanics of just in the actual

1378
01:09:37,692 --> 01:09:39,576
to write an equation
for the ligands

1379
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:40,989
to come in like [INAUDIBLE].

1380
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:43,462

1381
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:44,170
JEFF GORE: Right.

1382
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:48,300
So the idea is that when
you bind an attractant,

1383
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:53,459
that's going to change the
activity of the methylated.

1384
01:09:53,459 --> 01:09:55,000
So it's going to
change, for example,

1385
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,590
the fraction that are active.

1386
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,510
AUDIENCE: And
decreases the activity.

1387
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,510
JEFF GORE: And it decreases
the activity, right.

1388
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,250
AUDIENCE: And some
sort of signal--

1389
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,120
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
there's some-- right.

1390
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,411
And of course, we haven't
specified what that function,

1391
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,140
but the idea is that it leads
to a rapid decrease in activity,

1392
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,010
which corresponds to a rapid
decrease in this fraction that

1393
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,346
are active XM star.

1394
01:10:14,346 --> 01:10:19,116

1395
01:10:19,116 --> 01:10:19,990
Does that make sense?

1396
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:26,640

1397
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,550
So the last thing I wanted
to do is say something

1398
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,695
about what this means
for individuality.

1399
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:37,000

1400
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,160
In particular, let's
imagine that we

1401
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:46,130
have a clonal
population of bacteria.

1402
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,360
And the question
is, in what ways

1403
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,284
will they be similar
or different?

1404
01:10:50,284 --> 01:10:57,870

1405
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,790
So now, we can just
imagine an experiment

1406
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:04,010
where I take a population
of cells with exactly

1407
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:10,740
the same genetic code and I
go and I measure, for example,

1408
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,910
the tumbling frequency
across this population.

1409
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:17,140

1410
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:25,160
So we can talk about-- we
measure f1, f2, f3, fn--

1411
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,980
so these are the tumbling
frequencies across n cells.

1412
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:35,540

1413
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:41,360
This is n we'll say
genetically identical cells.

1414
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,040

1415
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:51,850
The question is, will we get
the same tumbling frequency

1416
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,820
or should these
things be the same?

1417
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,880
And if not, why not?

1418
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,440
So let's just do our
little votes, all right?

1419
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,230
We have should they be the same
or should they be different.

1420
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,020

1421
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,790
All right.

1422
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,770
Do you understand the question?

1423
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,270
Let's vote.

1424
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:11,940
Ready?

1425
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,920
Three, two, one.

1426
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,480
All right.

1427
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,480
Well, OK, so at least
the majority of people

1428
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,980
are saying they
should be different.

1429
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,313
And why might that be, somebody?

1430
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:26,180

1431
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,552
AUDIENCE: We might
have [INAUDIBLE]

1432
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:29,260
JEFF GORE: Right.

1433
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,710
For example, we
might have variation

1434
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:41,700
in the concentration
of chi R. Now,

1435
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,820
this variation is sort
of a natural result

1436
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,320
of just fluctuating
this or that, right?

1437
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,830
But it's a little bit similar
to the experiment Uri did,

1438
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,630
where he actually in
this case has actually

1439
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:56,640
put chi R under the control of
an inducible promoter, where

1440
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,240
he could just add IPDG
and drive expression

1441
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,354
and then just measure
the mean of these things

1442
01:13:01,354 --> 01:13:02,270
across the population.

1443
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:07,140
But even if you try to have
everything be the same,

1444
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,790
you'll have some
variation, which

1445
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:15,050
we found for small numbers
of proteins could be large.

1446
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:19,200
So that variation
will transmit itself

1447
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,080
into variations in both
the adaptation time

1448
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,282
and the tumbling frequency.

1449
01:13:23,282 --> 01:13:26,050

1450
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:31,800
And this is indeed was
observed as early as 1976.

1451
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,930
So there's a paper
in Nature in 1976

1452
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,510
by Jim Spudich and Dan Koshland.

1453
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,740
So Spudich went on
to study a number

1454
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,330
of these molecular motors.

1455
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:48,100
In particular, he studied
many of these myosins.

1456
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:53,070
But he wrote this classic paper
in '76 called "Non-genetic

1457
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:56,560
individuality, chance
in the single cell."

1458
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:02,300
What he did is they looked at
many different individual cells

1459
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,170
using a few of those techniques
that I told you about.

1460
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,600
And what they found is
that some of the cells

1461
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,340
seemed to be what they
called kind of "twitchy"

1462
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,800
and some of them seemed
to be more relaxed.

1463
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,360
So the twitchy cells are the
guys that had a larger tumbling

1464
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,180
frequency.

1465
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,570
So they wouldn't swim
as far as the others.

1466
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:22,278
So they'd swim just
a little bit and then

1467
01:14:22,278 --> 01:14:25,230
they'd change their mind, swim
a little bit, change their mind,

1468
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:28,867
whereas other cells had
much longer kind of runs,

1469
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,700
even though they're all
nominally identical.

1470
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,320

1471
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,700
Now, can somebody
say the time scale

1472
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:40,900
over which we would expect
that personality to persist?

1473
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:45,369

1474
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:46,660
AUDIENCE: Cell generation time.

1475
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,720
JEFF GORE: Yeah,
cell generation time.

1476
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,751
And why is that?

1477
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1478
01:14:50,712 --> 01:14:51,670
JEFF GORE: Yeah, right.

1479
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:58,540
So if this is chi R, over time,
it's going to do something.

1480
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,710
And so the typical
autocorrelation time

1481
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:04,480
should be kind of the
cell generation time.

1482
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,820
So what we call the typical time
should be rather generational.

1483
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,450

1484
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,080
So indeed, this is
the same as humans.

1485
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,510
We have a well-defined
personality

1486
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,040
and then we pass on some of
our personality to our kids.

1487
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,530
The typical time
scale is a generation.

1488
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,150
So I'm teaching you guys super
useful things in this class.

1489
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,830
I don't want anybody
saying anything else.

1490
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:30,780

1491
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,230
But I think that this
is a neat example of how

1492
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,240
different cells can have
what you might describe

1493
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,948
as being somehow
different personalities,

1494
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,250
but it arises for a
very particular reason

1495
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,960
because this information
is being transmitted

1496
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,112
through this network.

1497
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:46,570
Now, despite the
fact that they all

1498
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,479
have different chi
R concentrations--

1499
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,520
so they might have different
tumbling frequencies

1500
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,650
and so forth, but
they should all

1501
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,290
be able to display
this phenomenon

1502
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:56,260
of perfect adaptation.

1503
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,000
So what we then see is
that from the experiments

1504
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,170
and from some simple
models, you can

1505
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:04,300
get insight into how it
is that this phenomenon

1506
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,589
of perfect adaptation
might be robust to changes

1507
01:16:06,589 --> 01:16:08,880
in the concentrations of
different things, particularly

1508
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,820
chi R in this case.

1509
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,960
And chi R is the
dominant source of error

1510
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,760
because it's present
in such small numbers.

1511
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,430

1512
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:18,930
Now, in the last
two minutes or so,

1513
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,377
I just want to remind everybody
about the other context

1514
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,210
in which we studied
robustness, because it's

1515
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,930
a much simpler
example and it helps

1516
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,490
to clarify what we mean by it.

1517
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,840
Does anybody remember
the other context

1518
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,381
that we have talked
about robustness?

1519
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:35,608

1520
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:36,860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1521
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,610
JEFF GORE: Negative
autoregulation someone

1522
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,587
said, maybe?

1523
01:16:40,587 --> 01:16:41,170
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1524
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,620
JEFF GORE: OK, good, all right.

1525
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:47,210
So if we have some
protein that is negatively

1526
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:52,460
autoregulating itself,
then this adds robustness.

1527
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,860
And this is because
we can say, all right,

1528
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:59,330
this is the degradation term,
alpha x, the production term.

1529
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:03,340
And the limit of being perfect,
sharp, negative autoregulation

1530
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,140
looks like this.

1531
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,723
So this is the
production/degradation.

1532
01:17:05,723 --> 01:17:09,020

1533
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,350
And here, this might be beta.

1534
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:14,600
This is a k.

1535
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,060
Then, what we can
talk about is how

1536
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:23,000
the steady-state concentration
of x here is going to be k.

1537
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,620
And this thing is robust to
variations in some things,

1538
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,290
but not other things.

1539
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,870
For example, it's robust
to changes in alpha.

1540
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:32,899
That changes the slope.

1541
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,940
It's robust to changes in
beta, because that just

1542
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:39,030
brings it up and down, but it's
not robust to changes in k.

1543
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:42,360
So I think that any time
that if you are confused

1544
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,060
about robustness, in particular
thinking about robustness

1545
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,530
in the context of
chemotaxis gets

1546
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:50,150
you confused because of perfect
adaptation being confusing,

1547
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,108
I think it's always good
to come back and think

1548
01:17:52,108 --> 01:17:55,870
about this because this is the
most clear case where you can

1549
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,615
talk about-- this
is the robustness

1550
01:17:57,615 --> 01:17:58,990
of the steady-state
concentration

1551
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:03,900
of some protein against
variations in alpha and beta,

1552
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,950
but not against k.

1553
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:09,250
So it reminds you that it's
not that this level of x

1554
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,760
is robust against
everything, but it's

1555
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,960
robust against some things.

1556
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,668
And you can make sense
of which things it

1557
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:16,950
should be robust against,
which things not.

1558
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,700
So with that, I think
we're going to quit.

1559
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,960
I just want to remind
everybody that none

1560
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,410
of the work that we're
talking about here

1561
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:27,110
in the context of chemotaxis
and the genetic network

1562
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,460
will appear on the
exam, but we may

1563
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:32,840
have a problem on low
Reynolds number flow,

1564
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,420
maybe something Stokes drag.

1565
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:37,810
Diffusion might
make an appearance.

1566
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:38,780
Good luck on the exam.

1567
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,673
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

1568
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:41,173
