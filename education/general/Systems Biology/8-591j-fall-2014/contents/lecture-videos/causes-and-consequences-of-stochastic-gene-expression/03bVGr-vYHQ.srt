10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,230
PROFESSOR: Our goal for
today is to basically analyze

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,530
this simple model to death.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,520
So we're first going
to try to understand

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,190
the deterministic behavior
of this model gene

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,130
expression, where we just
get transcription of mRNA,

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,100
and then translation of protein.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,272
And after we think we
understand the mean behavior,

17
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,730
the deterministic
dynamics, then we

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,490
will try to understand
just stochastic behavior

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,400
in this model.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,370
So we're going to
try to understand

21
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,450
what's the distribution
of mRNA in a cell

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,920
in this simple situation.

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,770
What's the distribution
of protein?

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,400
What's going to be
the bursting behavior?

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,900
Everything you can
possibly think of

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,070
to ask about this
model, we will hopefully

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,230
have asked by the
end of today's class.

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,150
This simple model
of gene expression,

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,830
as was indicated in
the review, is perhaps

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,800
a reasonable description
of gene expression

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,180
in bacteria, when the gene
is in some active state.

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,312
So there's no repressor,
for example, bound.

33
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:26,770
Although maybe even
in the presence

34
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,660
of a repressor, if it's
binding and unbinding,

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,118
maybe you still end up getting
some sort of renormalization

36
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:32,600
that looks like this.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,220
But this is first order,
a reasonable description

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,710
of gene expression in bacteria.

39
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,460
And it's the model
that was basically

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,070
used in the Sunney Xie
paper that we talked about

41
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,860
on Tuesday.

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,560
And hopefully this
model will allow

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,880
us to think a little bit
more deeply about the data

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,640
that they obtained
in that paper.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,320
As always, we want to
start by understanding

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,612
the basic aspects of the model.

47
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,070
So what we're going
to do, is we're

48
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,010
going to go through
a series of questions

49
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,660
of increasing difficulty.

50
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,580
And in some of
them, we are indeed,

51
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,242
the answers will end up being
something divided by something.

52
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:14,200
In which case you take
advantage of your cards,

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,490
and illustrate that by putting
something on top, something

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:16,990
below.

55
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:24,410

56
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,270
But just first in this model,
what is the unit of time?

57
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,072
So if I say t is equal to
1, or delta t is equal to 1,

58
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:35,460
what am I referring to?

59
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,860
So we're not use the cards.

60
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,070
But in particular, the question
is, is delta t equal to 1,

61
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,560
is that a cell
cycle necessarily?

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,550
Yes or no, ready,
three, two, one.

63
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,850
Well I guess now maybe I've
complicated things by-- well,

64
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,910
this was really going to be
relevant for the later ones.

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,910
All right.

66
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,000
Now I've totally confused you.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,590
But can somebody offer
why it may or may not

68
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,920
be-- how do we think about the
unit of time in this model?

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,675
AUDIENCE: Usually
the lifetime of one

70
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,800
of the species [INAUDIBLE].

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,322

72
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,030
PROFESSOR: Right.

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,640
OK so indeed, what we often do
in these non-dimensionalized

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,530
models is we set
something equal to 1.

75
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,876
Have we set anything
equal to 1 here?

76
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,430
No.

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,888
So in principle,
we've said there's

78
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:28,440
some degradation rate of
the mRNA, some degradation

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,600
rate of the protein.

80
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,780
And in general, those will be
given in some units involving

81
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,120
seconds or minutes or hours.

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,350
So in general, so
at this stage, we

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,240
have not yet-- we
have not actually

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,980
gotten to this sort of
non-dimensionalized version

85
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,110
of any model.

86
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,490
So in this case this is
going to be something

87
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,500
like a seconds, or
minutes, or hours,

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,230
whatever units we use for
those degradation rates.

89
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,488
So we have not done anything
where it's the cell generation

90
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,863
time, or the protein lifetime,
mRNA lifetime, or anything

91
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:04,790
like that.

92
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,260
Here everybody happy with
this statement so far?

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,200

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,180
So we'll go ahead and vote here.

95
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,899
So we're going to do
some A, B, C, D's.

96
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,890
And you can always
combine anything you want.

97
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,630
So we'll go ahead
and say this is

98
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,980
the synthesis rate of the mRNA.

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,330
This is the degradation rate
for the mRNA, the synthesis

100
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,105
rate for the protein,
the degradation

101
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:31,980
rate for the protein.

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,747

103
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:36,830
And if you're just confused,
you can just do this.

104
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,288
But in general, for any of the
questions we're going to do,

105
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:40,997
you can do some
combination of these guys

106
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,954
by putting things in
numerator and denominator.

107
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:43,576
Yes?

108
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,534
AUDIENCE: Calculate the
population of the cells

109
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,650
that were hidden?

110
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

111
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,810
Question is, if you just
look at the cell population,

112
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,520
and you find it's
growing exponentially,

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,100
the question is what is
going to be that rate

114
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,016
of exponential growth.

115
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:59,570

116
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,090
Have I done something
wrong already?

117
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,158

118
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:05,074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

119
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:08,317

120
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:08,900
PROFESSOR: OK.

121
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,450
But I am going to say
that now for this we're

122
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,800
going to assume that
the protein is stable.

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,115
So it's not actually degraded.

124
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:22,870

125
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,400
This is to remind you of what
we read about in chapter one,

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,986
maybe of Uri's book,
maybe chapter two.

127
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,860
I'll give you 10 seconds
to think about this.

128
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:40,910

129
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,070
Do you need more time?

130
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,590
All right, Ready,
three, two, one.

131
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,010
OK.

132
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,230
We got a bunch of C's and a
bunch of D's and some E's.

133
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,730
All right.

134
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,250
So the E's are going to argue
with me, presumably rather than

135
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,750
a neighbor.

136
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,770

137
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,802
OK.

138
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,510
I think that there
are enough people that

139
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,012
are disagreeing on this to
maybe go ahead, and turn.

140
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,470
You should be able
to find somebody

141
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,580
that disagrees with you.

142
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,980
The distribution was a
bit patchy, unfortunately.

143
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,534
Did you guys-- you guys are
worried that you're not going

144
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:15,700
to be able to find somebody.

145
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,199
OK.

146
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,650
Fine, fine.

147
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,650
Yeah?

148
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,580
AUDIENCE: So if the
protein is stable, ah,

149
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,512
so the mRNA may not be stable?

150
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:26,095
PROFESSOR: The mRNA
may not be stable.

151
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:26,926
AUDIENCE: Ah, OK.

152
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:27,700
That makes sense.

153
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,980
PROFESSOR: And in general
which one typically

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,899
has a longer lifetime?

155
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,690
AUDIENCE: Proteins.

156
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,931
PROFESSOR: Proteins typically
have a longer lifetime.

157
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:35,430
Right.

158
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,810
So mRNA are actively
degraded, typically.

159
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,117
They're also just kind of
less stable intrinsically.

160
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,700
But what we're going
to assume for now

161
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,890
is that we're working
with stable proteins.

162
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,340
In which case the growth
rate of the population

163
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,270
will just be this
effective degradation

164
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,450
rate of the protein.

165
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,420
So in this model,
even if we say there's

166
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,050
no active degradation
of the protein,

167
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,940
still there's going to be some
effective degradation that's

168
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,930
due to dilution.

169
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,308
So we can say
effective, if you like.

170
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,280

171
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,819
So the rate of exponential
growth of the population

172
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,610
will be equal to this
effective degradation

173
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,151
rate for the protein,
if it's stable.

174
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,590

175
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,590
AUDIENCE: So you're talking
about the population

176
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,990
of the protein?

177
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,000
PROFESSOR: No.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,240
The growth rate of
the cell population.

179
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,620
So this is if we go
in there, and you

180
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,980
go into your spectrophotometer.

181
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,190
And you measure population--
numbers in function of time

182
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,280
is growing exponentially.

183
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,300
It'll grow exponentially
with this rate.

184
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,710
Because this is what's
causing the dilution.

185
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,423
In some ways if you
stop making the protein,

186
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,506
and you double the number
of cells, and that means

187
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:57,100
the concentration of
the protein in each cell

188
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,420
has to go down by
a factor of two.

189
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
So that's the statement.

190
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,347
Are there any questions about
why I'm making this argument?

191
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:05,846
Yes?

192
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:08,280
AUDIENCE: What was the relevance
of the protein being stable?

193
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,720
PROFESSOR: All right.

194
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,261
So the relevance of
the protein being

195
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:14,700
stable, because this is in
general, this delta, this

196
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,540
is the effective rate.

197
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,970
This is going to be equal to the
growth rate of the population.

198
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,740
So you might call
it gamma growth

199
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,010
plus the actual degradation.

200
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,599
I don't want to use
the same, but I'll just

201
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,770
say plus the degradation rate.

202
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,627
And this is a true physical
degradation, true degradation

203
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,750
rate of the protein.

204
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,380
So if it's stable, then we
say that this thing is zero.

205
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,820
So when we say
stable protein, it

206
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,970
means there's no
degradation of the protein.

207
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,700
So this physical
degradation rate is zero.

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,070
And then the effective
degradation rate of the protein

209
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,148
is just equal to the growth
rate of the population.

210
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:02,052
AUDIENCE: OK, so no degradation
means stable, basically?

211
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:05,434
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry, yeah.

212
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:07,350
Any other questions about
what I mean by this?

213
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,270

214
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,980
So now what we want to do is
ask a few other quantities

215
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,240
about this model.

216
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,650
So for example, what will be
the number of mRNA per cell?

217
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:32,450

218
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,455
And this is always
going to be the mean.

219
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:41,030

220
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,570
I'll give you 20 seconds.

221
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,560
In this model what is the
mean number of mRNA per cell?

222
00:09:45,560 --> 00:10:09,160

223
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
All right.

224
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,580
Ready?

225
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,720
Three, two, one.

226
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,410

227
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,580
And we have let's say
a majority of the group

228
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,420
is saying it's A over B, which
corresponds to the synthesis

229
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,540
rate of the mRNA divided
by the degradation.

230
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,370
Some people are this one?

231
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,750
Yes, so this is
indeed, synthesis rate

232
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,320
divided by the degradation rate.

233
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,120

234
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,330
Now this is saying
that what happens later

235
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,300
doesn't really matter,
for the mean mRNA number.

236
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,860
Because it's just that it's
going to be made at some rate.

237
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,290
Its lifetime is given
by 1 over delta m.

238
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,509
Now this thing, of course,
is again as always,

239
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,800
the effective degradation rate.

240
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,440
So it's the sum of the sort
of physical degradation rate,

241
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,570
plus this dilution
due to growth.

242
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,170
But in general, the
true degradation,

243
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,920
the physical degradation is much
faster than the cell division

244
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,980
rate.

245
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,350
So this is very close
to actually just

246
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,140
the physical degradation rate.

247
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,640
But in any case, it's
just delta m, regardless.

248
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,920
Are there any questions about
why this is the way it is?

249
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,820
Yes?

250
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,740
AUDIENCE: Does it matter
whether it's only physical?

251
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,610
Because wouldn't it be
the same if it were--

252
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,860
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter
that it's only-- exactly.

253
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,193
That's what I was trying to say.

254
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,680
So the way that
this is written, it

255
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,952
doesn't matter whether the--
this is the answer regardless

256
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,410
of whether the
physical degradation

257
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,990
rate is much larger than
the growth rate or not.

258
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,490
Yeah.

259
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,240

260
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,330
All right.

261
00:11:52,330 --> 00:12:00,150
What is this protein
molecules per mRNA?

262
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,690
How many protein molecules
are made from each mRNA?

263
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:40,215
Protein produced-- Do
you need more time?

264
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:52,040

265
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,820
Remember.

266
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,340
This is again, the
mean number of proteins

267
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,910
produced from a single
mRNA or each mRNA.

268
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,500

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,570
Let's go ahead and vote,
so I can see where we are.

270
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,330
Ready?

271
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,480
Three, two, one.

272
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,490

273
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:14,990
OK.

274
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,730
So we have, I'd say,
so at least a majority

275
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,961
are saying it's going
to be C over B Now.

276
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,460
All right.

277
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,510
So this is interesting.

278
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,660
So this is saying that
really what's happening

279
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,190
is that there's a
competition once you

280
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,660
make an mRNA that the proteins
are going to be getting

281
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,752
fired off at some rate.

282
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,460
But eventually it's
going to be degraded.

283
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,305
It's a competition
between those two rates

284
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,340
that determines basically
how many proteins,

285
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,219
how many times do you fire
off a protein before you

286
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:48,760
get degraded.

287
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,930

288
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,230
Any questions about that logic?

289
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,767

290
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,100
AUDIENCE: Can you please just
repeat that one more time?

291
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,810
PROFESSOR: Sure.

292
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,054
Right, so what we're assuming
is that OK, an mRNA is produced.

293
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,220
And that's already happened.

294
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,800
So it doesn't matter
what Sm is anymore.

295
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,780
So now we have an mRNA.

296
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,670

297
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,580
Eventually this mRNA
will be degraded.

298
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,210
But before that happens,
we want to know, basically

299
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,710
how many proteins do
we expect to be made.

300
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,820
Now if Sp and delta m
are the same that means

301
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,800
you kind of expect one
protein to be made on average,

302
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
before it's degraded.

303
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,380
Or if Sp we're twice
delta m, then you

304
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,580
would get two proteins made
before it was degraded.

305
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,680
Now this is a mean statement.

306
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,000
We're about to start
thinking-- in 10 minutes,

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,140
we'll think about
this distribution.

308
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,560
And so we have to be careful.

309
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,504
But in terms of mean
behavior, this thing is true.

310
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:48,243
AUDIENCE: So is this
different than it

311
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:53,467
has been for the number of
proteins per mRNA in the cell?

312
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,300
PROFESSOR: Is this
different from the number

313
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,150
of proteins in the cell?

314
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,551
AUDIENCE: Number of proteins
per mRNA in the cell.

315
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,006
Because then you will have to
do the protein concentration

316
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:06,107
over mRNA concentration.

317
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:06,690
PROFESSOR: OK.

318
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,190
Right.

319
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,140
So this is not the same thing
as asking about the ratio

320
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,430
of the number of proteins.

321
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,239
And we can calculate
that as well.

322
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,280
Yeah these are different.

323
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,775

324
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:21,400
This is the number
of protein molecules

325
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,632
produced from each mRNA.

326
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,340
So this is just talking
about production.

327
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,740
Because indeed, the
degradation rates

328
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,823
are going to be different.

329
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:31,330
So then we can see what
that ends up being.

330
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,490
Any other questions about
why this one is what it is?

331
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,930

332
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,150
How about the number of mRNA
produced per cell cycle?

333
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,500

334
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,380
And for now we're going to
ignore factors of log two.

335
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:36,840

336
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,790
Do you need more time?

337
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,704

338
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:42,620
So another 10 seconds.

339
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:54,596

340
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,592
AUDIENCE: Produced
but not degraded?

341
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:59,110

342
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,524
PROFESSOR: Produced, yes.

343
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,024
We're just talking
about production.

344
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:05,089

345
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:10,980
Because we've already calculated
a number of mRNA in the cell.

346
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,670
But now we want to know
the mean number produced.

347
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,490
For example, this is the
same as the mean number

348
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,910
of protein bursts observed
in Sunney Xie's paper.

349
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,089
But this is just the number of
mRNA produced per cell cycle.

350
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:27,589
All right.

351
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,180
Let's see where we are.

352
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,679
Ready?

353
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,811
Three, two, one.

354
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:32,310
All right.

355
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,720
So we've got lots
of A's over D's.

356
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,060
That's sounds nice.

357
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,090
So this is going to be
some synthesis rate.

358
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,600
But now the relevant
thing is this delta p.

359
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,250
Because that's the
cell division rate.

360
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,050
So it's barring
issues of log two,

361
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,630
it's approximately
the synthesis rate

362
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,770
of the mRNA divided by delta p.

363
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,760
Because this is the
growth rate of population.

364
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,595
Cell generation time
is log two off of that.

365
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,470
Are there any questions
about that statement?

366
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,810

367
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,870
All right, so this
is the mean number.

368
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,745
Now from the paper, we know
how this thing is distributed.

369
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:16,080

370
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,270
We should probably-- we're going
to use a bunch of distributions

371
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,840
over the next couple.

372
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,540
So we can-- we like
exponential distributions.

373
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,810
We like geometric distributions.

374
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,465

375
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,370
We like Poisson.

376
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,390

377
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,500
We like Gaussian.

378
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,900

379
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,160
And we like gamma.

380
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,672

381
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,505
These are various
probability distributions.

382
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,887
The question is, how is
it that now, not the mean,

383
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,470
but how is the number
of mRNA produced

384
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,400
per cell cycle distributed.

385
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,960
Ready?

386
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,800
Three, two, one.

387
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,580

388
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,620
All right.

389
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,290
We've got some-- this side
of the rooms a little bit

390
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,530
slower, maybe.

391
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,710
But that's OK.

392
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,370
So maybe some people are not
confident of this statement.

393
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:22,870
OK.

394
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,286
So this one ends
up being Poisson.

395
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:27,000

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,630
So this is indeed how
the number of-- this

397
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,100
is number mRNA per cycle.

398
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,190
Now this is-- so
Poisson, in general,

399
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,080
that's what you get if there's
some probability per unit time

400
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,030
that something's
going to happen,

401
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,696
and you want to know how many of
them happen in some finite time

402
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:45,240
period.

403
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,115
That's basically the
definition of a Poisson.

404
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,700

405
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,110
And this is, if you recall,
this is what we talked about

406
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,610
on Tuesday.

407
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,200
The probability observe n,
it's given by this mean number.

408
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,820
So if lambda is
the mean, then we

409
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,620
get lambda to the
n, over n factorial,

410
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,020
e to the minus lambda.

411
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,840
If you go ahead and
calculate the mean of this,

412
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,170
you indeed get lambda.

413
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,890
So lambda is equal to the
mean, which in this case

414
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,530
was around, well in the
case of Sunney's paper,

415
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,821
does anybody remember
what that roughly was?

416
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:26,570
It was around one.

417
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:35,490

418
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,770
Now what about this other one?

419
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,600
So we also have
another mRNA problem,

420
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,900
which is that we calculated the
mean number of mRNA per cell.

421
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,790
If you look at a cell,
the mean number is this.

422
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,970
But what's the
probability distribution

423
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,400
of the number of mRNA per cell?

424
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,940
So we probably-- I'm trying
think it-- you probably

425
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,980
don't yet know this answer.

426
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,720
This ends up also being Poisson.

427
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,960
We're going to
calculate this in a bit.

428
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,260
But this is very
confusing somehow.

429
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,816
That both this thing and
this thing, are Poisson.

430
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,190
But they're not
the same Poisson,

431
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,410
in the sense they have
different lambdas.

432
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,617
Which one is going to be larger?

433
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,492
This one or this one?

434
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:18,090

435
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,030
The bottom one, right?

436
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,260
And that's because delta m
is much larger than delta p,

437
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,910
typically.

438
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,800
So indeed, if you ask, in
Sunney's paper, for example,

439
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,460
there was just over one mRNA
produced per cell cycle.

440
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,420
But the mean number of mRNA
might have been 1/30th of that.

441
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,910
Because the degradation rate
was just 1 and 1/2 minutes.

442
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,520
What that's saying is that
in a typical situation

443
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,900
you would not see an mRNA
in a cell in that condition.

444
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,800

445
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,550
We're going to calculate
this in a moment.

446
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,810
So don't worry if you don't
see why it's a Poisson.

447
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,859
But don't get confused.

448
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,400
There are two
different distributions

449
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,869
that arise from the mRNA in
the cell or in the cell cycle.

450
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:03,160
And they're different Poissons.

451
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,190

452
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,980
And I think that-- I mean I'm
sure that in some deep sense

453
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,605
there's a reason that
they're the same.

454
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:13,760
But it's somehow not
immediately obvious.

455
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,456

456
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,830
So there was another one that
we might have wanted to do,

457
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:27,070
which is the mean number
of proteins in each cell.

458
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:42,820

459
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,740
Now this one is a bit harder.

460
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,341
And this one is going to take
full advantage of the cards

461
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:50,590
that you have in front of you.

462
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,425
So be prepared.

463
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm going to give
you 30 seconds.

464
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,201
Because this one
you might-- well

465
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,784
you might need a
little bit more time.

466
00:22:57,784 --> 00:23:33,682

467
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:34,640
AUDIENCE: This is hard.

468
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,719

469
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,385
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

470
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,272
Although I think that
it's useful to see that

471
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:43,230
it can be a bit tricky.

472
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,120
Because this really is the
simplest possible model.

473
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,370
We're going to talk
about some models that

474
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,721
get to be horribly complicated.

475
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,220
And so it's useful
to just make sure

476
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,401
you can nail down the
intuition on this model.

477
00:23:54,401 --> 00:24:10,610

478
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,150
All right.

479
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,066
Do you need more time?

480
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:15,179
It's OK if this is escaping
you at this moment.

481
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,720
Why don't we go and
see where we are?

482
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,350
Ready?

483
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,030
Three, two, one.

484
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,640

485
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
All right.

486
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,332
So you know all the
naysayers on the cards,

487
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,790
now that you've
done this, you feel

488
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,540
like it's an amazing system.

489
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,200
So it's AC over DB.

490
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,540
So the two, the product
of the synthesis rates

491
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,060
divided by the product
of degradation rates.

492
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,040
So what we have is
the synthesis rate

493
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,000
for the mRNA divided by the
degradation rate for the mRNA.

494
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,666
Synthesis rate for the proteins
divided by the degradation rate

495
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,800
for the proteins.

496
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,210
Can somebody give us
a verbal explanation

497
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,014
for why this might have
been, or why this is?

498
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,002
Yes?

499
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:55,990
AUDIENCE: It's
the same reasoning

500
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,972
as the number of mRNA per cell.

501
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:04,439
But instead of just a
basel-- like a synthesis rate

502
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,427
doesn't depend on
the concentration.

503
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:08,940
You're just multiplying
the synthesis rate

504
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,001
by the number of mRNA.

505
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,250
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's great.

506
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,160
OK.

507
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,220
So what you're saying is that
this thing here was indeed,

508
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,325
we calculate that was the mean
number of mRNA in the cell.

509
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,700
If you just start
with something,

510
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,120
and you have a production
and degradation rate.

511
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,620
OK.

512
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,510
Well that means that if you had
one mRNA, then indeed that's

513
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,100
what the concentration would be,
is this Sp divided by delta p.

514
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,440
But now we-- well we multiply
that by the number of mRNA,

515
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,600
and then we are set.

516
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,500

517
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,000
All right.

518
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,010
Now another question.

519
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,130
We have a distribution,
or a mean protein--

520
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,350
wait sorry, mean number.

521
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,190
We have the mean number
of protein produced

522
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,730
from each mRNA, is something.

523
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,720
And the question is, is this the
most likely number of proteins

524
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,420
to observe.

525
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,195
Is the distribution
here, now this is a mean,

526
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:15,570
but now we want
to start thinking

527
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,960
about the probabilistic
stochastic elements.

528
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,590
Is this the most likely, is
it like the number of proteins

529
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,932
observed from an mRNA?

530
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:25,030

531
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,240
The question is, is
this most likely.

532
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,380
By which I mean is the
probability distribution

533
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,480
peaked here.

534
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,170
So we're going to do an A
as a yes, and B is a no.

535
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,390

536
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,520
Does everybody understand the
question I'm trying to ask?

537
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,612
So an mRNA is here.

538
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,570
There's going to be some
proteins made from it.

539
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,040
This is the mean.

540
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,249
What I want to know is, is
that we should somehow expect?

541
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:56,540
In a sense, is the distribution
peaked, the probability

542
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,630
distribution peaked
around this value?

543
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,410
And C is-- do I want
to do a depends?

544
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,321
Well you can always argue after.

545
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:11,750
Do you need more time?

546
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,622
AUDIENCE: Is this,
you're saying,

547
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:16,134
is this the most likely
number of proteins?

548
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

549
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,778
What I'm wondering
is the mode there?

550
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:22,444
AUDIENCE: Right.

551
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:24,560
But only for this quantity?

552
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
PROFESSOR: Only yeah.

553
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,200
So now we're not
doing means anymore.

554
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,158
We want to know if the
probability distribution

555
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:31,980
of the protein
produced from each mRNA

556
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,950
is the mode around this.

557
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,960
Ready?

558
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,810
Three, two, one.

559
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,310
All right.

560
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,144
We got a lot of
no's, but some yeses.

561
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:42,685
So this is actually
going to be a no.

562
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:49,860
And this was because the
probability distribution.

563
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,150
The question is, what is
the probability distribution

564
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,551
for the number of proteins
produced from each mRNA.

565
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,800
It's going to be one of these.

566
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,640
Ready?

567
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,400
Three, two, one.

568
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,610

569
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,110
All right.

570
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,770
So we've got some difference.

571
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,634
But I'd say that
most of the group

572
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:10,050
is saying it's
going to be A or B.

573
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,790
And indeed these are almost
the same distributions.

574
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,727
What's the difference
between them?

575
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,810
AUDIENCE: One's discrete--

576
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:16,980
PROFESSOR: Right.

577
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,938
So this guy's discrete.

578
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,680
This guy is continuous.

579
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,180
Right.

580
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,760
Indeed when we're taking
about the numbers,

581
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,343
then we should get--
it's a geometric.

582
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:27,592
But often we're kind of a little
bit loose about these things.

583
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:29,550
So it's not a disaster
if you said exponential.

584
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,180
But the key thing is
that the distribution

585
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,380
looks something like--
so now I've certainly

586
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,930
drawn it as an exponential.

587
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,250
This is the probability
of n as a function of n.

588
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,430
Of course, the geometric
thing it looks--

589
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,322

590
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,286
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

591
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:49,079
So why should we expect
that distribution?

592
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,120
PROFESSOR: Why should we
expect the distribution?

593
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,620
So one answer is
that because that's

594
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,940
what you read on Tuesday.

595
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:02,740
But let's go ahead and--
yes, but let's go ahead

596
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,300
and calculate it.

597
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,020
That's useful.

598
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,530

599
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,280
The way to think about
this, in some ways,

600
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,060
there's another way
to write this perhaps.

601
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,925
Which is that imagine
you have an mRNA.

602
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,820

603
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,270
Now at some rate it's
going to be degraded.

604
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,460
And maybe we'll keep the
degradation rate down,

605
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,320
just for-- so there's
a degradation rate.

606
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,090
But then if you'd like, we
could draw it like this.

607
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,885
Where this is the synthesis
rate for a protein.

608
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,310
And out pops a protein.

609
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,704

610
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:42,120
And so the idea is that is
here we're in some state where,

611
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,540
OK, here we have an mRNA.

612
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,495
Here's the state where
we don't have an mRNA.

613
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,620
Now this is the competition
between those two rates

614
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,780
that I was telling you about.

615
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,613
There is some degradation
rate for the mRNA.

616
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,040
Or there's a synthesis rate
where we go around this loop.

617
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,550
If we come around this
loop, we come back

618
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,700
to the state with an mRNA.

619
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,090
There still is an mRNA intact.

620
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,776
Just out pops a protein.

621
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:02,150
So then what we
want to do, is we

622
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,310
want to think about what's
the number of proteins

623
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,929
that we expect,
not just the mean,

624
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:09,095
but the actual distribution.

625
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:13,560

626
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,980
So it's useful in
these situations

627
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:25,185
to define some probability
rho, which is the probability

628
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:27,360
you actually, if
you're here, it's

629
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,110
the probability that you
produce one protein at least.

630
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,930
The question is, which
path do you take initially.

631
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,620
Well that's just
given by the ratios.

632
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,980
So there's the rate that we
take this circular path divided

633
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,120
by the sum of these
two other rates.

634
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,320

635
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,710
And then what we can
do is we can ask, well

636
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,570
what is the probability that
0 proteins are produced,

637
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,420
probability that we get 0.

638
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,700
Well if we take
this path initially,

639
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,019
will we have 0 proteins?

640
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:04,560
AUDIENCE: No.

641
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,150
PROFESSOR: No.

642
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,110
Right, so this
probability is indeed

643
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,010
simply equal to the probability
that we do this first, which

644
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,560
is 1 minus rho.

645
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:20,394

646
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:22,310
Now what's the probably
that we get 1 protein?

647
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,640
Well, only 1?

648
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,740
That's equal to the probability
that we first take this path,

649
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,682
and then we take this path.

650
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,390
Well we can multiply
those probabilities.

651
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,350
Because we first take
the circular path

652
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,770
to make a protein.

653
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,920
And then we take the
degradation path.

654
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,690
Well what's the
probability we get 2?

655
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,110
Well that's just that we
come around here once,

656
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,450
twice, and then degrade.

657
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,540

658
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,830
Now if you're not
seeing a pattern here,

659
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,840
then we're in trouble.

660
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,400

661
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,910
So this says the
probability of n

662
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,730
will then just be equal to
rho to the n, 1 minus rho.

663
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:08,850

664
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,340
And indeed, it's
always useful in order

665
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,370
to warm up your
probability muscles,

666
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,880
to check to make sure that this
is a normalized probability

667
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,830
distribution.

668
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,820
So sum over all possible
ends indeed goes to 1.

669
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,190
And that's just because the sum
over a bunch of rho to the n's

670
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,440
is equal to 1 divided by 1 minus
rho, which is the term there.

671
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,591
And that goes to 1.

672
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:37,682
AUDIENCE: So this is making
a pretty strong assumption

673
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:38,890
that they're all independent?

674
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,180
PROFESSOR: Yep, yep.

675
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,540
Yep.

676
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,970
This is assuming that if you've
gone around once, you return.

677
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,100
But I've come back to
the original state.

678
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,962
AUDIENCE: But do
mRNAs like actually

679
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:55,060
get caught in ribosomes--

680
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,720
PROFESSOR: There are a lot
of things that can be true.

681
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,972
And I would say that
in biology and in life,

682
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,430
what you do is you
first write down

683
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,790
the simplest possible model.

684
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,540
And then you go and
you make measurements.

685
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,300
And you ask whether the simplest
possible model can adequately

686
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,380
explain the data.

687
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,086
And if the answer
is no, then you're

688
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,960
allowed to start thinking
about other things.

689
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,770
Because everything's
is in principle true.

690
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,400
In that mRNA, maybe
it's this or that.

691
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,130
The question is whether
it's significant.

692
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,046
And at least from the
data from Sunney's group

693
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,807
would say that in that
condition, in those cells,

694
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,390
that those things
are not significant,

695
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,950
in the sense that you still
get a geometric distribution.

696
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,429
Of course it could also be that
those other things actually are

697
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,470
true and are significant.

698
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,120
But then you end up
with some new parameters

699
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,260
that describe how things look as
a result of all the complexity.

700
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,762
That's also OK in
the sense that I'd

701
00:33:48,762 --> 00:33:50,720
say that you can get a
quantitative description

702
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,300
of the process by describing
it as a geometric with just

703
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,580
a single free parameter.

704
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,750
And they found that the mean
was four, or four or five.

705
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,960
The mean number of proteins
produced from each mRNA.

706
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,040
But they got this geometric
distribution in that paper.

707
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,809

708
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:11,309
Yes?

709
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:15,159

710
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,940
And I'll just mention
here that the mean of this

711
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,730
is rho divided by 1 minus rho.

712
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,280

713
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,860
So what you see is
that as rho goes to 1,

714
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,060
then this thing is
going to diverge.

715
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,050
And that makes sense.

716
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,540
because as rho goes to 1, it's
saying that you essentially

717
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,750
always synthesize another
protein rather than degrading.

718
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,520
And before I move
on, I just want

719
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,270
to say one more thing,
which is that there

720
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,507
are many different definitions
of the geometric distribution,

721
00:34:44,507 --> 00:34:46,382
depending upon whether
the probability of rho

722
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:47,390
is the probability
of terminating,

723
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,640
or the probability of going
around, and also depending

724
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,300
on whether you're asking
what is the-- here

725
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,860
we're talking about
the probability

726
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,320
distribution for the number
of proteins produced.

727
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,690
Whereas we could have
talked about the probability

728
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,148
distribution for the number of
times we go around this loop

729
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:03,150
before, no, no sorry.

730
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,200
That is for the number
of proteins produced.

731
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,000
So the other way you could
have defined this is the number

732
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,960
of times where it's-- the number
of cycles that you had to go

733
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,360
before you went here, in the
sense that if you first go

734
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,756
here, you can either
call that a 0 or a 1.

735
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you see what I'm saying?

736
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,890
And reasonable
people can disagree.

737
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,570
But you end up getting
distributions that are

738
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,200
just a little bit different.

739
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,250
So watch out.

740
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,060
If you just memorize
something, you

741
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,050
might have memorized
the equation

742
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,240
for a different definition
of this distribution.

743
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,780
Does everyone understand
what I tried to say there?

744
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,380
Maybe?

745
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,285
Yeah?

746
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:41,826
AUDIENCE: When
there's no degradation

747
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:43,492
is it still a Poisson?

748
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:46,550
PROFESSOR: Ah, if there's no
degradation then would this

749
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,040
be a Poisson?

750
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,329
I mean, this would
be infinity, right?

751
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,870
AUDIENCE: Right,
[INAUDIBLE] protein,

752
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,216
this is done independently,
like there's an mRNA.

753
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:59,620
[INAUDIBLE] proteins
independently.

754
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,654
PROFESSOR: OK.

755
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:02,570
So I want to be clear.

756
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:08,000
This is, p of n is,
this is the probability

757
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,150
distribution for
number of proteins n,

758
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,480
produced from a single mRNA.

759
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,020

760
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,059
Now if there's no
degradation of the mRNA,

761
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,600
then this thing is
not even, I think,

762
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,940
defined in that the
number of proteins

763
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,330
produced from that mRNA just
really goes to infinity.

764
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,090
If you wanted to ask about
the probability distribution

765
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,170
for the number of
proteins produced

766
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,470
in some unit, some period
of time that would indeed

767
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,410
be a Poisson
distribution, assuming

768
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,210
that there's no degradation.

769
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,972
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say?

770
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:02,780
AUDIENCE: So Sp is like 0?

771
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,330
PROFESSOR: If Sp, I'm sorry.

772
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,872
If Sp were 0?

773
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:09,038
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

774
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:21,367

775
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:21,950
PROFESSOR: OK.

776
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,325
And you're saying that what
would be Poisson distributed?

777
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,225
AUDIENCE: The
number of proteins.

778
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:36,090

779
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
that actually-- no I

780
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,940
think that-- I think that
you're probably right.

781
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,176
That as Sp goes to 0-- I'm
a little bit worried that--

782
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:46,050
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

783
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,670
Zero-th order, sorry.

784
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,436
PROFESSOR: Oh.

785
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,284
AUDIENCE: Not 0.

786
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,220
[INAUDIBLE]

787
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,135
PROFESSOR: OK.

788
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:55,260
Right, so the mRNA distribution
we're about to find

789
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,250
is indeed going to be a
Poisson at steady state.

790
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,090
And so if there's some
process by which the protein

791
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,980
distribution is
really just mirroring

792
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,810
the mRNA distribution, then
it will also be Poisson.

793
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,680
Although I think you have to be
careful about how you actually

794
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,050
implement that.

795
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,290
Because even in the absence
of this geometric bursting,

796
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,390
different things, I
think, can happen.

797
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,420
Because for example, if there
were exactly 10 proteins

798
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,800
produced from each mRNA, then
that probability distribution

799
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,240
is a shift.

800
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,570
But then it's no
longer actually going

801
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,150
to be Poisson, because the mean
and variance are going to scale

802
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,450
differently if you do that.

803
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,450
Let's maybe do the Poisson
distribution for the mRNA

804
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,950
first.

805
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,420
And then we can try
to touch back on this.

806
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,040

807
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,790
So this is a plot of kind
of geometric distribution

808
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,155
with a mean of 3-4-ish.

809
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:56,860

810
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,312
Is everybody happy
with where we are now?

811
00:39:00,312 --> 00:39:02,060
OK.

812
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,290
Now from this, what
we've said so far

813
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,770
is it obvious what the
distribution of proteins

814
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,580
will be in a cell?

815
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,080
We can say obvious, yes.

816
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Or not obvious, no.

817
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,330
Ready, just verbal, yes?

818
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,020
Ready or no?

819
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,520
All right.

820
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,020
Ready?

821
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,690
Three, two, one.

822
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,317
AUDIENCE: No.

823
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:18,900
PROFESSOR: No.

824
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,570
Right.

825
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,560
So we've said that
the distribution

826
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,116
of size of protein bursts
from single mRNA is geometric.

827
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:26,490
But that doesn't
mean that that's

828
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,919
going to be the distribution
of proteins in the cell.

829
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,460
And indeed after,
we're going to find

830
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,790
that the distribution of
mRNA is going to be Poisson.

831
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,830
But even then it's not
obvious what the distribution

832
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,455
of proteins is.

833
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:47,410

834
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:47,910
All right.

835
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,410
So what we want to
do now is we want

836
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,390
to introduce kind of a
simple version of what's

837
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,650
known as the Master Equation.

838
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,390

839
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,010
Now you guys are going to
do more reading on this

840
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,330
for the lecture on Tuesday.

841
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,080
Where we're going to talk about
the Master Equation, as well

842
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,310
as the Fokker-Planck
approximation.

843
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,620
Maybe the Gillespie
algorithm, and so forth.

844
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,380
But I want to start by
thinking about the this notion

845
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,084
in the simplest
possible context.

846
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:16,500
So what we're going
to do is we're

847
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,580
going to think about the world.

848
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,550
So we want to know the steady
state, or the equilibrium

849
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,170
distribution of mRNA numbers in
the cell, given this process.

850
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,400
So that's great.

851
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,630
We can-- so mRNA
distribution, question mark.

852
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:40,520

853
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Now in this case we don't
care about Sp, delta p,

854
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,032
because the only things that are
relevant are going to be these.

855
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:48,490
Now what we're
going to do is we're

856
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,830
going to think about the
world in which we just

857
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,010
defined states corresponding
to the different numbers

858
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,950
of these mRNAs.

859
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,860

860
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,170
So there's a state
where there's 0.

861
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,120
We can't go to the
left, less than 0,

862
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,490
but we can go to the state where
there's 1, or the state where

863
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,620
there's 2, and so forth.

864
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:16,340

865
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,590
Now the description
here is supposed

866
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,680
to be the analog
of this over there.

867
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,094
So this is trying to
understand the situation where

868
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:27,010
the deterministic equations
would be described

869
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:32,050
by m dot is equal to
this some synthesis rate,

870
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,600
minus a degradation rate that's
proportional to the number,

871
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,186
so minus delta m times m.

872
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:42,590

873
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,880
So what you can see is that
the deterministic equations

874
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,010
are very simple.

875
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,296
We already calculated
the equilibrium.

876
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,670
So when this thing
is equal to 0,

877
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,185
then we get that m
equilibrium is just

878
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:57,810
going to equal to the synthesis
rate divided by the degradation

879
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,309
rate.

880
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:02,210

881
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,830
If we're away from
the equilibrium

882
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,836
in this deterministic
approximation,

883
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,460
how long is it going
to take us to kind

884
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,640
of approach our equilibrium?

885
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,610
Verbal answer, ready?

886
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,100
Three, two, one.

887
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,192
[STUDENTS RESPOND]

888
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:14,900
PROFESSOR: Right.

889
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,130
So it's going to
be 1 over delta m.

890
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,320
So this tells us the
characteristic timescale

891
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,160
to come back.

892
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,015
So if we're-- this is the
equilibrium Sm over delta m.

893
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:31,570
This is m as a function of time.

894
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,980
If we're below, we come here.

895
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,070
If we're above, we come here.

896
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:41,686
And this time is 1 over delta m.

897
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,202
Are the any questions about?

898
00:42:43,202 --> 00:42:50,920

899
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,130
Now this-- so I
want to highlight

900
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,640
that this is like the world's
simplest dynamical equation,

901
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,654
almost the world's simplest.

902
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:03,820
Yet what we're going to
find is that once we go over

903
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,695
and we try to understand
the full probability

904
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:08,320
distribution of the
stochastic system

905
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,470
then it's a little
bit more complicated.

906
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,140
In particular, we end
up with an infinite set

907
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,710
of differential equations.

908
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,640
So in general the
Master Equation format,

909
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,380
where we're going to write
differential equations for how

910
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,530
these probabilities
change over time.

911
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,350
Now what we've done is we've
traded a single differential

912
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,170
equation for an infinite number
of differential equations.

913
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,650
So that's a bummer.

914
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,210
But on the other
hand, it will allow

915
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,830
us to do the full
stochastic treatment.

916
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,341
And it's also a nice, to
me, the master equation

917
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:43,590
is useful in kind of two ways.

918
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,610
One is that it's going
to be a tool for us to do

919
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,110
analytic calculations.

920
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,010
But it's also kind
of a principled way

921
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,300
of organizing your thoughts
so that you can go and do

922
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,860
stochastic simulations, if
that's what you want to do.

923
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,240
So it's also just kind
of like a weigh station

924
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,150
to kind of help you
set up your simulation.

925
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:15,754

926
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,170
So what we're going
to do is we're

927
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,260
going to ask about
the general way

928
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,240
that this thing is going to
move between different states.

929
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,390
In particular, we
are going to have

930
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,950
some general state in here.

931
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:35,365
Mn, which can go forward
or back, Mn plus 1.

932
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:47,060

933
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,700
Now what we want to do is think
about how those probabilities

934
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,970
are going to change over time.

935
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,640
So we typically have fn.

936
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,040
So this is often written
as an fn and fn minus 1.

937
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,710
And then this is a g.

938
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,040
I want to make sure I get
the n's and n minus ones

939
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,836
correct here.

940
00:45:09,836 --> 00:45:13,030

941
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:17,890
Typically we write
gm plus 1, gn.

942
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,205
So these are telling
us about the rates

943
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:25,350
of being in this state,
with say, n mRNAs, as

944
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,190
compared to going here.

945
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,860
We're going here.

946
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,260
So then what we can
do is we can write

947
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:41,560
the change in the probability
of mn with respect to time.

948
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,750
Well there are just
a few different ways

949
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,890
that the probability can change.

950
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,280
So we can leave the state
in two different ways.

951
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,955
fn, gn.

952
00:45:51,955 --> 00:45:55,210

953
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,460
So the way that we
lose the probability

954
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,840
is that we have fn plus
gn times the probability

955
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,426
that we are in mn.

956
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:08,285
That's an n there.

957
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:09,910
And then there are
going to be two ways

958
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,660
that we gain probability.

959
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,260
We can gain probably
from the mn minus 1.

960
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:21,450
So this is fn minus 1,
plus we can get probability

961
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,960
from the upper state.

962
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,440
That's a gn plus 1 mn plus 1.

963
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,590
So this is just saying that
the change in the probability

964
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,470
of being in this state is going
to be given by the probability

965
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,061
that we leave the state.

966
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:38,560
Sorry.

967
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,710
The probability that
we enter the state,

968
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,376
minus the probability
that we're leaving

969
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:46,200
the state, kind of the rates.

970
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,570
Now this is going to
be true for all n,

971
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,220
except for n equal to
zero, we don't have

972
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,330
the terms over on the left.

973
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,170
So this is kind of for all n.

974
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,630
So this is, in
particular this is for n,

975
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,250
basically 0 on up to infinity.

976
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,480
So this is a differential
equation for the probability

977
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,700
for having an mRNA.

978
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,790
But this is, we have to have a
different equation for each n,

979
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,830
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on up.

980
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,510

981
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:20,890
So this is what I mean by
converting single differential

982
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,990
equation, which is actually an
exceedingly simple one, for one

983
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,335
that is for an infinite set.

984
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:28,460
And each one is even a
little bit more complicated.

985
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,400
In general, these f's and n's
can be pretty complicated.

986
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,450
In this situation
they're not so bad.

987
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:40,520
But let's make sure.

988
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,470
Can somebody say what
fn and gn are equal to?

989
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:51,830

990
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,144
Any volunteers?

991
00:47:54,144 --> 00:47:56,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

992
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,670
PROFESSOR: Right so fn, this
is rate that we add a new mRNA.

993
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,450
Well that's just
synthesis rate for mRNA.

994
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,774
And this guy is what?

995
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:08,686
AUDIENCE: Delta.

996
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,310
PROFESSOR: So this
is degradation rate.

997
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,598
And we actually do have to
multiply still by the number n.

998
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:18,720

999
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,100
And that's because as we go
further out here to the right,

1000
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,540
then it is true.

1001
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,140
The rate at which we come back
to the left is increasing.

1002
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,670
Because there's just more
mRNA that can be degraded.

1003
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,010

1004
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,540
Now it's worth saying that
you can, for example, use

1005
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,880
this to simulate the
probability distribution

1006
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,850
if you start from any
distribution you like.

1007
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,370
So for example, you could
start M0 equal to 1.

1008
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,210
And then just simulate how
the probability recalibrates

1009
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,740
and comes over here.

1010
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,340
Similarly, you could
do it over here.

1011
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,030
You could start with any
probability distribution

1012
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:54,590
you want.

1013
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,375
And you could use
this as a framework

1014
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,500
to calculate what the
probability distribution will

1015
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,620
be at any time later.

1016
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,600

1017
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,460
But you can also use
this just as a way

1018
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,950
of figuring out what the
equilibrium distribution is

1019
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:10,450
going to be.

1020
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,040
Because at equilibrium,
we can just ask,

1021
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,915
for each one of these
arrows, the probability

1022
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:18,289
of moving to the right has to
be equal to the probability

1023
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,070
of moving to the left, otherwise
we wouldn't be at equilibrium.

1024
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,202
And that's true for every one of
these kinds of pairs of arrows.

1025
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:27,400

1026
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,090
And in particular,
what we can get,

1027
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,555
and I want to make
sure that-- so but it's

1028
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:45,360
not that fn is equal to gn--
so it's really going to end up

1029
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,600
being that if you
see what fn and gn,

1030
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:56,680
so that fn is going to have
to be equal to g of n plus 1

1031
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,350
for all n.

1032
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,320
Yes?

1033
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,260
AUDIENCE: Do you
also need to multiply

1034
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,715
like natural probabilities--

1035
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:05,860
PROFESSOR: Ah, Yes, yes, indeed.

1036
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:11,100
So that sorry, times
mn times m of n plus 1.

1037
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,870

1038
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,700
So it's the kind of probably
flux so we have to equalize.

1039
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,780
So this is nice because this
gives us a ratio of things.

1040
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,440
In particular, this tells
us that the probability

1041
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,810
of being in the n plus 1 divided
by the probability of being n,

1042
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,350
and this is at equilibrium.

1043
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,330

1044
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:44,130
Is going to be fn
divided by gn plus 1.

1045
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,830
Which is this synthesis rate.

1046
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,710
And then down here is going
to be this degradation rate

1047
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,300
times, in this case, n plus 1.

1048
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:00,300

1049
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,430
So this is useful.

1050
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,790
Because for example,
if we start at m,

1051
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:11,240
we could say that m1
over m0-- well maybe

1052
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,330
we'll even put the
m0 over on the right.

1053
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,360

1054
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,330
So then m1, what
is that equal to?

1055
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,650
That's going to be
synthesis rate divided

1056
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:28,010
degradation rate, times m0.

1057
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,420
But then we also know that m2,
well that's going to be again,

1058
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,596
synthesis rate divided
by degradation rate.

1059
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:36,970
And we're going
to get a squared.

1060
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:42,550
But then now we have to
divide by 1/2 times m0.

1061
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:51,600
Continuing on, m3 we get
Sm over delta m cubed,

1062
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,750
divided by 1 over
3 times 2 times m0.

1063
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,830

1064
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,200
So in general, we
get the probability

1065
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,870
of being in the nth state,
is going to be this thing.

1066
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:10,480
We'll call it lambda for now.

1067
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,350
Lambda to the n, divided
by n factorial, times m0.

1068
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,980

1069
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,280
Now what's the-- and
I'll-- remember lambda here

1070
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,426
we've defined it to be
the ratio Sm over delta m.

1071
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:31,120

1072
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,840
Now if we sum over all
these probabilities,

1073
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,800
what should we get?

1074
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,300
AUDIENCE: 1.

1075
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,460
PROFESSOR: 1.

1076
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:42,620
Right, if we sum over this
thing, what does that equal to?

1077
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,840

1078
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,200
It's what?

1079
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,640
AUDIENCE: Eta lambda.

1080
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,100
PROFESSOR: Eta lambda, right?

1081
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:57,750
So just remember in this
world-- the sum over lambda

1082
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:03,490
to the n, n factorial, from
n equal to 0 to infinity,

1083
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,570
this is indeed the definition
of e to the lambda.

1084
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,420

1085
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,055
So what that means is that
the normalization condition is

1086
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:19,951
that m0 has to be equal to e
to the minus lambda, which is

1087
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:21,200
indeed a Poisson distribution.

1088
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:30,548

1089
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:32,332
I'll raise it up a little bit.

1090
00:53:32,332 --> 00:53:36,680

1091
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,160
So this is saying,
OK, to back up.

1092
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,390
If we just have constant rate
of creation of something,

1093
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,910
constant rate of
degradation of that thing,

1094
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,720
on a per item basis,
per unit basis,

1095
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,050
then you end up getting
a Poisson distribution,

1096
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,760
at equilibrium for the
number of that thing,

1097
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,310
in this case, the number
of mRNA in the cell.

1098
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:04,310

1099
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,940
Questions about why that is?

1100
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,700
What happened?

1101
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,620
How we calculate it?

1102
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,931

1103
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,823
AUDIENCE: Could you
explain why [INAUDIBLE]?

1104
00:54:13,823 --> 00:54:16,954

1105
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:17,620
PROFESSOR: Sure.

1106
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:24,440

1107
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,810
So this is basically f of n.

1108
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,850
And this is basically
this g of n.

1109
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:35,530
But remember here n is
the number of proteins

1110
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,550
or the number of mRNA.

1111
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:42,480
So then that's in the context
of the master equation,

1112
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,900
then m and n are there.

1113
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,416
You get n by the
current number of m.

1114
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,290
Does that make sense?

1115
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:51,250

1116
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,270
Yes?

1117
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:57,546
AUDIENCE: I'm confused how
you changed m0 to the e

1118
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:58,920
to the minus lambda.

1119
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,940
PROFESSOR: OK.

1120
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,130
Well let's just do it.

1121
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:09,890
So mn, this is the probability
that we observe n mRNA.

1122
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,610
And we know that
the sum over mn,

1123
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:18,335
so all these probabilities
from n equal to 0 to infinity,

1124
00:55:18,335 --> 00:55:20,410
has to be equal to 1.

1125
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,970
Something has to happen.

1126
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,080
Well let's do this sum.

1127
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,380
This is equal to the
sum of lambda to the n,

1128
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,470
over n factorial m0.

1129
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,890

1130
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:36,490
But m0, is this a function of n?

1131
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,100

1132
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,690
No.

1133
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,480
m0 is just, this is just the
probability at equilibrium

1134
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,410
that you have 0 mRNA.

1135
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,479
So we can just pull
this thing out.

1136
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:48,270
This is just some
number, some probability.

1137
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:54,560

1138
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,720
Now the statement is
that while this thing,

1139
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,610
this is the definition
of e to the lambda.

1140
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:03,060

1141
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:08,160
So in general, so e to the x
we often write is equal to 1,

1142
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,633
plus x, plus x squared
over 2, plus dot, dot, dot.

1143
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:16,190

1144
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:20,820
So this thing is indeed
just equal e to the lambda.

1145
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,370
So what we know is
that this is still 1.

1146
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,150
So m0 times e to the
lambda, is equal to 1,

1147
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,614
so m0 is to the minus lambda.

1148
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:35,590

1149
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,750
Any other questions
about how we got here?

1150
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,182
What's going on?

1151
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:41,598
Yes?

1152
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,570
AUDIENCE: The plot
of the solution

1153
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,060
to the adjoining
equation, that would

1154
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,370
be like the mean
value, that would

1155
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:52,515
be the behavior of
the mean values?

1156
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,930
PROFESSOR: That Is
the expected behavior

1157
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,570
of the mean value over time.

1158
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,640
In this case, fn and gn
are both linear functions

1159
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,140
of the number of the mRNA.

1160
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,670
Which means that in the
context of the master equation,

1161
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:14,590
if you ask about the
expectation of mn,

1162
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:20,300
this quantity is indeed equal
to-- it has the same behavior

1163
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:28,210
as, over time, as the
deterministic equations.

1164
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,890
So if f and g are
nonlinear, then

1165
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,420
actually you get a deviation.

1166
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,750
But in this case, it
is indeed the same.

1167
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:41,230
What it means that
if you compare

1168
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,680
the stochastic and the
deterministic trajectories,

1169
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,900
what you would see
is that this thing

1170
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:51,040
is going to be a little
bit jagged, or whatnot.

1171
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,420
And then even at
equilibrium it's

1172
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,380
going to come up and
down a little bit.

1173
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,213
I'm trying to add a
little bit of jaggedness

1174
00:57:56,213 --> 00:57:57,870
because it's discrete.

1175
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:01,230
But the deterministic
equation here

1176
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,630
is what you would get
if you average together

1177
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,549
an infinite number of these
stochastic trajectories.

1178
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:09,465
Because another one might
have come down here.

1179
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:13,200

1180
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,938
Does that answer?

1181
00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:18,686
AUDIENCE: Is m
playing a double role?

1182
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:20,186
Like in that
deterministic equation,

1183
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:22,210
m is the concentration of mRNA?

1184
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:25,410
PROFESSOR: I think that I'm--
yeah I think that I should--

1185
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,320
my nomenclature I think
was not very good.

1186
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,360
I've used two different things.

1187
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,880
And now that I'm
doing this, I think

1188
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,980
that I should have-- I should
have just called it p of n,

1189
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,965
or maybe I should've
used n here.

1190
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:44,972

1191
00:58:44,972 --> 00:58:46,930
I think I was trying to
be consistent with some

1192
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:49,340
of the previous, but I
think it was a mistake.

1193
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,460

1194
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,927
Yes?

1195
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:55,510
AUDIENCE: Are you
plotting stochastic?

1196
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,820

1197
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:05,720
PROFESSOR: I'm plotting--
OK, so no, I'm not.

1198
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:11,450
So this is if you run an
actual stochastic trajectory.

1199
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,180
Then at any moment
in time, you just

1200
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,830
have one-- there's
some number of mRNA.

1201
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,410
Whereas the sum
over the mn's, this

1202
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,290
is talking about the
probability distribution

1203
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,430
of the entire thing.

1204
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,580
So really if you started here,
the master equation would give

1205
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:30,550
you some distribution for the
n's, some distribution for m's.

1206
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:33,350
And so if you looked
at these over time,

1207
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,510
than the mean of
these distributions

1208
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:40,481
is indeed equal to the
deterministic behavior.

1209
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:40,980
Yes?

1210
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,230
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
recover, like how would we

1211
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,631
recover the differential
equation from the master

1212
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:48,130
equation?

1213
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,280
Is that possible?

1214
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,630
Maybe that would help.

1215
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1216
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,814
I think that in the
end, there's going

1217
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:56,730
to be a one-to-one
relationship from, I guess,

1218
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:00,230
this differential equation
to the master equation.

1219
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,999
I'm trying to think
of any weird case

1220
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,540
or something funny's
going to happen.

1221
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,830
Is something funny
going to happen?

1222
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:05,371
AUDIENCE: No.

1223
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:08,246
But like the easy way is just
to write them all in terms

1224
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:09,222
of the distribution.

1225
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:13,068
And you can just
differentiate the whole sum.

1226
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:17,460
And in that sum, we
express the [INAUDIBLE]

1227
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,388
with your last equation.

1228
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:23,022
[INAUDIBLE]

1229
01:00:23,022 --> 01:00:23,730
PROFESSOR: Right.

1230
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,966
But I think this is the
much more mathematical way.

1231
01:00:25,966 --> 01:00:27,590
I mean because I
think that actually, I

1232
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:31,810
mean, from the
differential equation, you

1233
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:34,440
actually from the terms
here, you can actually

1234
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,060
construct the master equation.

1235
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,544
And I think by the same way,
you can go from the master

1236
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:40,960
equation, and I
think that there's

1237
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,334
going to be a
unique differential

1238
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,950
equation that would have gotten
you to that master equation.

1239
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:46,990
So I think just from
the terms you can do it.

1240
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,530
You could also do like
moment generating functions

1241
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,620
to get to how things change.

1242
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:59,540
But I mean I think that it's
really from this, for example,

1243
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,050
I think it tells you that that
was the differential equation.

1244
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,980
Does that--

1245
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,100
I mean it's sort of--
the way that we typically

1246
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,350
do things these things, is
that we have a differential

1247
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,790
equation, and then we
construct the master equation.

1248
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,248
So then we already knew what
the differential equation was.

1249
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:20,100
But I think just from the
terms in your master equation,

1250
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,769
you can say, all right.

1251
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:25,102
This was the differential
equation that it started with.

1252
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:31,486

1253
01:01:31,486 --> 01:01:33,360
Any other questions
about what happened here?

1254
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:40,320

1255
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,650
So we have, I think, a fair
number, a fair knowledge

1256
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,890
of what's going on here now.

1257
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,930
We know that the
equilibrium distribution

1258
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:52,620
of mRNA in the cell is
going to be Poisson.

1259
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,600
We also know that
the distribution

1260
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,230
of the number of mRNA produced
per sell cycle is also Poisson.

1261
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,600
But it's a different
Poisson from the first one.

1262
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,097
We know that the number of
proteins produced per mRNA

1263
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:05,805
is going to be
geometrically distributed.

1264
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,775

1265
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,400
The one thing that
we have not yet done

1266
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,650
is to ask about the distribution
of protein in the cell.

1267
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,352
So let's say
something about that.

1268
01:02:19,352 --> 01:02:21,060
I'm not going to do
the whole derivation.

1269
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,560
Because it's harder.

1270
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,180
But I encourage you to--
even the continuous version

1271
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,840
of the derivation is
definitely harder than this.

1272
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,620
But then the discrete
derivation is even worse.

1273
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,060
So what we're going
to talk about,

1274
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,530
and the way we'll
typically maybe

1275
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,613
think about this from the
standpoint of this class

1276
01:02:41,613 --> 01:02:46,257
is the continuous
approximation to-- oh,

1277
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:47,840
that might have ended
up being useful.

1278
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,790
Well it's OK.

1279
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:54,499
Is the continuous approximation
to the real answer.

1280
01:02:54,499 --> 01:02:56,790
And in particular, just the
way that the exponential is

1281
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:00,820
the continuous approximation
of the geometric distribution,

1282
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,370
in the same way you can
think about the equilibrium

1283
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,370
distribution of
protein in the cell.

1284
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,720
In this model is going
to be gamma distributed.

1285
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,110
But gamma is a
continuous distribution.

1286
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:17,880
But it's a continuous analog
of the negative binomial.

1287
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:33,401
So let me just make sure I'm--
and Sunney Xie actually has

1288
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:38,670
a nice PRL paper where he
derives the gamma distribution.

1289
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,970
But even earlier
actually Paulson

1290
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,700
had derived this negative
binomial distribution,

1291
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,690
the discrete version
of the solution.

1292
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:56,910

1293
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,379
So this is the number
of protein per cell.

1294
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,420
We already know the mean.

1295
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,870

1296
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:09,410
So this is approximately
distributed as a gamma.

1297
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,410
A gamma is a distribution
that requires two parameters

1298
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,330
to describe.

1299
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:17,230
So a Poisson can be described
by single parameter.

1300
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,150
Gamma is typically
described by two.

1301
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:23,580

1302
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:29,806
And b is going to
be the burst size,

1303
01:04:29,806 --> 01:04:43,390
whereas a is the mean number
of bursts per cell cycle, which

1304
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,850
is the same as the
mean number of mRNA

1305
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:47,500
produced, so mean
number of bursts.

1306
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:56,670

1307
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:00,080
So the gamma of this a, b.

1308
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:18,850

1309
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:19,350
All right.

1310
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,920
So the gamma of a is
the gamma function.

1311
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,360
It's equal to-- now is
it a minus 1 factorial?

1312
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,770
I always get the-- is it a
minus 1 or a plus 1 factorial.

1313
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,590
Anybody remember this?

1314
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,370
Yeah, a minus 1.

1315
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:43,830

1316
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,290
I mean it's like
a lot of things.

1317
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,740
You look at this equation.

1318
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,980
It doesn't really
mean a whole lot.

1319
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,540
But I think that a reasonable
way to think about this

1320
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:55,810
is the gamma is
approximately what

1321
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:02,260
you get when you add together
a different exponentials

1322
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:06,515
with length scale, given by b.

1323
01:06:06,515 --> 01:06:08,140
When you add probability
distributions,

1324
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,909
you have to do a convolution.

1325
01:06:09,909 --> 01:06:11,700
So in some ways, the
way to think about it,

1326
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,908
and this kind of makes sense.

1327
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:15,720
Because what is
happening is that it

1328
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,631
takes something of
order cell division time

1329
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:19,880
for these proteins to go away.

1330
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,200
Because they're stable.

1331
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,070
Now each-- and so then
what you want to know

1332
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:27,200
is how many proteins
are kind of produced

1333
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,200
over the course of a cell cycle.

1334
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:36,144
Well that actually you can get
at by asking how many bursts

1335
01:06:36,144 --> 01:06:37,060
are there going to be.

1336
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,430
And then how big are the bursts?

1337
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:41,450

1338
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:47,580
So indeed, the mean here
is equal to a times b.

1339
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,860
And the variance is equal
to a times b squared.

1340
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:56,551

1341
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:58,550
So for example, if you
have a single exponential

1342
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:06,270
distribution, with burst size
b, then this is what you get.

1343
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:09,820
So this is the probability
that you get n proteins.

1344
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,500
And this is this function of n.

1345
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,500
So for a single burst, this
is exponentially distributed.

1346
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,990
So this is the
continuous version.

1347
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,830
Now if we add together
multiple of these bursts,

1348
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,330
this is really saying that we
sample from this distribution,

1349
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,240
say twice.

1350
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,120
And then we add the
resulting value.

1351
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,790
So this is a convolution.

1352
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,500
You guys will have
an opportunity

1353
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,310
to practice this on
your problem sets.

1354
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,910
But what happens
is that you end up

1355
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:39,660
getting something that looks
like-- it's going to go.

1356
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,920

1357
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,380
So it increases linearly.

1358
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,470
If you added three
of them together

1359
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,871
this increase is quadratic.

1360
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:49,120
And it kind of goes like that.

1361
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,415
So this thing
becomes kind of-- it

1362
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:54,652
goes from a
distribution where it's

1363
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:57,110
peaked at 0, to something that's
peaked at a nonzero value.

1364
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:00,060

1365
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,660
Now you can ask,
for example, what

1366
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:09,810
happens as for a large a,
if you have many bursts,

1367
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,330
what does this thing look like?

1368
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:14,415
Oh, I wish I hadn't erased
my probability distributions.

1369
01:08:14,415 --> 01:08:17,290

1370
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:22,233
So what are the gamma
converged to for large a?

1371
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,149
A normal distribution.

1372
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:23,950
Right?

1373
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:26,359
So that's the central
limit theorem.

1374
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:28,939
If you take any well-behaved
probability distribution,

1375
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:29,649
you add it.

1376
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:31,821
You sample from it many times.

1377
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:33,279
Then you end up
getting a Gaussian.

1378
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,528

1379
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:40,069
If you don't remember
that very well,

1380
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:43,580
then this is something to
read about over the weekend.

1381
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:49,109

1382
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:50,580
Just like the
Poisson is also going

1383
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:57,745
to go to-- for large
lambda, the Poisson

1384
01:08:57,745 --> 01:08:58,870
also looks like a Gaussian.

1385
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,330
Can somebody give
an explanation,

1386
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:03,500
an intuitive explanation
for why that should be?

1387
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,773
Why it-- yes?

1388
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:08,697
AUDIENCE: Because in a
Poisson distribution,

1389
01:09:08,697 --> 01:09:10,307
you can't have
anything negative.

1390
01:09:10,307 --> 01:09:10,890
PROFESSOR: OK.

1391
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,848
So a Poisson distribution
can't have anything--

1392
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,970
but now I feel like
you're arguing against me.

1393
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:17,579
Because a Gaussian has
negative values, right?

1394
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:18,245
AUDIENCE: Right.

1395
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:22,946
So when the mean is really
small, only have [INAUDIBLE].

1396
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:23,529
PROFESSOR: OK.

1397
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:24,100
Yeah.

1398
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:24,990
All right.

1399
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:28,755
So what you're saying is
that Poisson for small lambda

1400
01:09:28,755 --> 01:09:30,035
it can't go negative.

1401
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:32,221

1402
01:09:32,221 --> 01:09:32,720
OK.

1403
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,568
No I think that that's true.

1404
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:37,609
Yeah, and so somehow the
probability distribution

1405
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:39,974
is somehow piling
up, as you say.

1406
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:41,974
What are some other ways
of thinking about this?

1407
01:09:41,974 --> 01:09:50,463

1408
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,379
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1409
01:09:51,379 --> 01:10:00,289

1410
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:04,744
Because if you have a low lambda
that means it's a Poisson.

1411
01:10:04,744 --> 01:10:08,704
And then I'm just
imagining stretching out.

1412
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:09,240
[INAUDIBLE]

1413
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,137

1414
01:10:12,137 --> 01:10:12,720
PROFESSOR: OK.

1415
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,051
So I think that's fair.

1416
01:10:14,051 --> 01:10:15,550
Another way we can
think about this,

1417
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,425
is let's say that we
have some process that's

1418
01:10:17,425 --> 01:10:20,600
occurring randomly over
some period of time.

1419
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,470
And this could be
say, mRNA production.

1420
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,250
And here this is just the
number that we observe here,

1421
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,580
this is going to be a Poisson,
with some mean lambda.

1422
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:33,580
Now let's just say that I take
another one, same process,

1423
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,520
same period of time.

1424
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,186
How is this guy going
to be distributed?

1425
01:10:36,186 --> 01:10:38,229

1426
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:39,520
So this also Poisson of lambda.

1427
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,430

1428
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:47,740
Now let's say I take this
probability distribution,

1429
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,970
and I take this
probability distribution.

1430
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,259
And I convolve them.

1431
01:10:52,259 --> 01:10:54,050
I'm going to do the
calculation of my head.

1432
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,100
I did it.

1433
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:02,410
So for those of you who haven't
done convolutions-- whatever.

1434
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,380
Yes, what's the new
distribution going to be?

1435
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:11,380

1436
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,242
Poisson 2 lambda.

1437
01:11:13,242 --> 01:11:14,450
And why does that have to be?

1438
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,306

1439
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:18,306
AUDIENCE: That line was
sort of you put it by n.

1440
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:21,690

1441
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1442
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:22,911
That's right.

1443
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:25,100
This line, I just kind of
like I just made it up.

1444
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:25,990
I could have just said, oh.

1445
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,948
Well it's the same process
occurring over here.

1446
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:29,247
So we have to have the mean.

1447
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:31,080
It's still is going to
be a Poisson process.

1448
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,085
And the mean has to
be the-- well we just

1449
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:35,960
had twice the length.

1450
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,210
And indeed, for independent
probability distributions,

1451
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,655
means always add.

1452
01:11:39,655 --> 01:11:41,780
So this all consistent will
all the things we know.

1453
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,690
So this has to be a
Poisson of 2 lambda.

1454
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,370
If I add another
segment on here,

1455
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,600
it has to Poisson of 3 lambda.

1456
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,590
But what you see is that we see
that Poisson of n lambda, which

1457
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:52,840
is the sum over many Poissons.

1458
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,724

1459
01:11:55,724 --> 01:11:57,890
Poissons are well-behaved
probability distributions.

1460
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:58,560
You add them
together, you're going

1461
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,990
to have to get a Gaussian.

1462
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,840
So you can see that the
Poisson has to become

1463
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,940
Gaussian for large lambda.

1464
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,010
And indeed it does.

1465
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:09,520

1466
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,660
So there's a comment
about this in the--

1467
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,950
AUDIENCE: It's a little bit
more complicated than this

1468
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,990
because obviously you
always just divide

1469
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,430
from lambda [INAUDIBLE].

1470
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,895

1471
01:12:21,895 --> 01:12:24,617
Like you would have to say
that Poisson lambda is just

1472
01:12:24,617 --> 01:12:28,340
like a combination of S--

1473
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,410
PROFESSOR: OK.

1474
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,860
You're saying that if I do
this calculation backwards,

1475
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:32,710
I'm going to get into trouble.

1476
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,043
Because if I try to break them--

1477
01:12:34,043 --> 01:12:36,689
AUDIENCE: So if you
require lambda to be-- you

1478
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:39,736
have to have like a significant
probability of getting at least

1479
01:12:39,736 --> 01:12:40,970
one candidate, right?

1480
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:45,670
PROFESSOR: So I'd say lambda has
to be much, much larger than 1.

1481
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:50,986
So once you're at lambda of
100, it looks like a Gaussian.

1482
01:12:50,986 --> 01:12:53,110
And in Sunney's paper, he
had a comment about this.

1483
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:54,526
Does anybody
remember what it was?

1484
01:12:54,526 --> 01:12:59,160

1485
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,290
Was mRNA production
really well described

1486
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:06,395
as-- they mention
that actually there

1487
01:13:06,395 --> 01:13:12,105
is some violation of
this model in the data.

1488
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:14,079
AUDIENCE: Does it
go into eukaryotes?

1489
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,120
PROFESSOR: Oh, as soon as
you go into eukaryotes,

1490
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,160
this is why I stay
away from them.

1491
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,350
But even in their
data, in E. coli,

1492
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,080
they actually
observed a deviation.

1493
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:29,955

1494
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:32,500
So what they found is that there
was a cell cycle dependence

1495
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,810
to this bursting rate,
i.e. the mRNA production

1496
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,510
over the course
of the cell cycle.

1497
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,450
And presumably their
conclusion of this

1498
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,740
was that you have this guy.

1499
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,160
And then he turns
into, gets longer.

1500
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,817
And then eventually he septates,
and then you get two cells.

1501
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:55,540

1502
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:59,940
What he found is that these
longer cells had actually

1503
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:03,210
a larger rate of mRNA synthesis
than the smaller cells.

1504
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,460
And actually this makes sense.

1505
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,590
Because here you maybe have
just one copy of the genome.

1506
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:12,930
Whereas here you might have--
you're making a second copy.

1507
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,180
So you might have two
copies of that gene.

1508
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:21,117
So it may make sense that this
bursting rate should grow.

1509
01:14:21,117 --> 01:14:22,700
But does that mean
that you should not

1510
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,130
expect it to be a Poisson
distribution for the number

1511
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,642
of bursts per cell cycle?

1512
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:33,540

1513
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,040
No.

1514
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,420
It actually is still-- it still
is described by a Poisson.

1515
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,650
Because you can just say,
this is the cell cycle.

1516
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,480
And here this is
Poisson of sum lambda 1.

1517
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,270
Here is a Poisson
of sum lambda 2.

1518
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:46,970
So there could be
a different rate

1519
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:47,700
over the course of the thing.

1520
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,241
But you still have
just two Poissons.

1521
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:51,230
You still get another Poisson.

1522
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:54,215
So adding Poissons,
gives you backup Poisson.

1523
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:56,090
They don't have to have
the same mean lambda.

1524
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:04,230

1525
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:07,550
I just want to make
one comment about what

1526
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:09,940
you have to do once you start
thinking about eukaryotes.

1527
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:15,540
And the basic-- so you can
see the gamma distribution

1528
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,877
can either be peaked at 0, or it
can be peaked at nonzero value.

1529
01:15:19,877 --> 01:15:21,710
So most, for like highly
expressed proteins,

1530
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:24,880
you'll see that it looks
something like this.

1531
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,620
Now for eukaryotes,
you also have

1532
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,490
to consider there's
some rate that you

1533
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:33,500
go between an active
and inactive promoter.

1534
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:37,790

1535
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,470
And this actually makes
things much more complicated.

1536
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:43,220
So there's a rate
going to inactive,

1537
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,990
a rate going to active.

1538
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,390
And so now if you
look at, for example,

1539
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,980
the mRNA number per
cell, you'll see

1540
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,950
that it is no longer a Poisson.

1541
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:57,230
And I encourage you, if you're
curious about such things,

1542
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:00,340
to come up and look at this.

1543
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,320
The solution for the
steady state distribution

1544
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,528
has been solved analytically.

1545
01:16:03,528 --> 01:16:06,630
For example, Arjun Raj, who
is the author of the review

1546
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:11,100
that you guys just read,
derived this equation here,

1547
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,756
which I don't know
if you can see.

1548
01:16:12,756 --> 01:16:14,130
But even from a
distance, you can

1549
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,734
see that this is the solution.

1550
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:17,525
And this is just for
the mRNA distribution.

1551
01:16:17,525 --> 01:16:20,640
This is not even getting to
the level of the protein.

1552
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,620
And it involves many gamma
functions, as well as

1553
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,210
a confluent hypergeometric
function of the first kind,

1554
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,400
which is a disaster.

1555
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,230
But he went to Courant.

1556
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,570
He was an applied mathematician.

1557
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,180
So this is, I
guess, this is what

1558
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:40,030
you can do after doing a
PhD in applied mathematics.

1559
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,020
The point though is that it
ends up being very complicated.

1560
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,490
And you can get hugely varying
distributions for the mRNA.

1561
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:50,240
And indeed this is seen
in individual cells.

1562
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,170
If you look at mammalian
cells, just at the mRNA level,

1563
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:56,260
you can have some cells that
have hardly any mRNA, some

1564
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,920
that have a huge number.

1565
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,720
The protein
distributions actually

1566
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,890
end up being more regular
than the mRNA distributions.

1567
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:07,290
Because of this
difference in lifetime.

1568
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,800
So the mRNA numbers
may fluctuate wildly.

1569
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,480
But the protein numbers
will fluctuate less,

1570
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,720
because they last longer.

1571
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,360
So then you do some averaging
over this crazy mRNA business.

1572
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,940

1573
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,680
Now in the last--
yeah, go ahead.

1574
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,862
AUDIENCE: In terms of
timescale, like all

1575
01:17:27,862 --> 01:17:31,500
this is switching to the
active and inactive promoter,

1576
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,480
like to the other--

1577
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,390
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

1578
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:36,490
That's a good question.

1579
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:39,470
I think that people argue
very much about this.

1580
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:41,630
This is kind of minutes.

1581
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,150
This can be hours.

1582
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:48,370
And this is maybe in
between those timescales

1583
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:51,020
would be typical.

1584
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,540
And when I say hours, especially
like in mammalian cells,

1585
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,630
they might only divide
once a day or so.

1586
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:59,460
So then this gets
to be many hours.

1587
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:03,935
And then I'd say
minutes is kind of the--

1588
01:18:03,935 --> 01:18:10,110

1589
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:13,190
So there were many
biological examples that

1590
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:14,690
were discussed in that review.

1591
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,560
And I'm not going to
talk about all them.

1592
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,070
But I think that
it's a nice review.

1593
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,492
Because it goes over some of
the papers that you've read,

1594
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:22,950
or that we've talked about over
the course of the semester.

1595
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:26,050
It also illustrates some
different biological context

1596
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:28,460
in which noise may play a role.

1597
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,220
But I want to mention
one study that

1598
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:33,450
was done by actually
again, Arjun together

1599
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:37,460
with Hedia Maamar, in
collaboration with Dave Dubnau,

1600
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,130
where they were studying
this process of competence.

1601
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:43,060
So in B. subtilis, during
sometimes particularly

1602
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,580
of starvation, or other
forms of unhappiness,

1603
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:49,190
they kind of pick
up DNA from outside.

1604
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,170
So they'll import DNA.

1605
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,740
Some of it may just be consumed.

1606
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:56,940
But some of it could actually
be incorporated into the genome.

1607
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:01,130
Now what they found is that
this competence process is

1608
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,830
mediated by this protein comK.

1609
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:08,000

1610
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,450
And there was a
positive feedback loop,

1611
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,780
where this guy ends up
positively activating itself.

1612
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:19,270
And this helps lead to
bistability in this network.

1613
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,270
Only a small
fraction of the cells

1614
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,760
kind of get into this
high feedback state.

1615
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,660
Only a small fraction of them
activate competence and then

1616
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,260
uptake DNA.

1617
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,150
And what they were able
to show in that study

1618
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:33,270
was that it was sort
of noise-induced.

1619
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,760
That they were able to
vary both the transcription

1620
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,120
rate and the translation
rate, in a way

1621
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,840
so as to reduce the noise.

1622
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,580
The mean is the same.

1623
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:49,650
So if you in the context of
this model, what they did

1624
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:52,640
is they varied
transcription rate,

1625
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,640
and they varied
translation rate,

1626
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,180
each say, by a factor of 2.

1627
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:02,550
So they got the same mean,
but then different noise.

1628
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,630
And we're out of time.

1629
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,340
I would have you vote.

1630
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,800
But can anybody remember?

1631
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,010
If you want to
decrease the noise

1632
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:12,310
in the number of the
proteins, which of these

1633
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,717
do you want to go up, and
which do you want to go down?

1634
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:16,800
And which one is going up?

1635
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,599
Which one's going up let's say?

1636
01:20:18,599 --> 01:20:19,140
AUDIENCE: Sm.

1637
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,270
PROFESSOR: Sm.

1638
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:23,154
Right, so if you want
to reduce the noise,

1639
01:20:23,154 --> 01:20:24,820
but keep the mean
constant, you increase

1640
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,120
the rate of transcription,
and you decrease

1641
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,120
the rate of translation.

1642
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,460
Because the noise is really
driven by this protein

1643
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,250
bursting behavior here.

1644
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,910
And that's precisely
what they did.

1645
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:36,630
They changed those
two quantities.

1646
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,480
They got the same
mean, lower noise,

1647
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,860
and then they reduced the amount
of competence in that sur--
