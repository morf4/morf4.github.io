10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,770
PROFESSOR: Today,
what we want to do

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,760
is finish off our discussion
of Lotka-Volterra competition

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,666
models.

13
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,540
So starting with this
idea of the two species

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,950
interacting competitively
but then moving on to try to

15
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,366
think about the
general properties

16
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,450
of Lotka-Volterra systems.

17
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,199
In particular, when
you have more species,

18
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,100
the kinds of dynamics
that you can get.

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,270
Also, we're going to talk
about these non-transitive

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,770
interactions, which are the
rock-paper-scissors type

21
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,550
interactions that may facilitate
the maintenance of diversity

22
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,640
in populations or
ecosystems, in particular,

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,910
in the presence of some
sort of spatial structure.

24
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,204
And so we'll talk both
about this demonstration

25
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,870
of rock-paper-scissors
type interactions

26
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,580
in the context of
male mating strategies

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,850
in lizards, this paper
that was by Curt Lively.

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,424
And then we'll talk
about another paper

29
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,590
in the microbial realm,
where they showed that there

30
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,500
are rock-paper-scissors type
interactions in the context

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,940
of colicin production,
toxin production

32
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,870
in the context of bacteria.

33
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,720
Then, at the end, we'll talk
about these population waves.

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,761
There was a rather
mathematical reading

35
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,260
that I had originally proposed,
but then we kind of switched

36
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,730
things up a bit, so
that you could, instead,

37
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,739
read that rock-paper-scissors
paper-- that is confusing--

38
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,030
that I think is maybe more fun.

39
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,580
But I'll tell you kind of this
basic idea of the population

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,242
waves, what happens, if you have
a combination of some growth

41
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,200
process together with
some effective diffusion,

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,100
you can get these
population waves that

43
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,890
correspond to this process
of range expansion,

44
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,840
where a population expands
into new territory.

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,870

46
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,950
I just started by
putting up what

47
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,780
we had from the last class.

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,070
So this is the two species
Lotka-Volterra competition

49
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,930
model.

50
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,870
So what we found was that,
for this to be competition,

51
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,960
for the species to be kind
of bad for each other,

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,025
that that corresponds to
the betas being positive.

53
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,740

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,720
Now, what we found is
there are four cases

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,675
in terms of the outcome of
this two species interaction.

56
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,280
And we wanted to,
at least, try to get

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,040
some sense of why that was
and what the trajectories

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,180
might look like.

59
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,370
If you look at and N1 and N2,
we can draw these nullclines

60
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,470
and then get a sense of
where the trajectories are

61
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,180
going to go.

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,660
Now, the basic outcome of this
two species Lotka-Volterra

63
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,460
competition model are
really exactly the same

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,360
as the possible
outcomes when we're

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
thinking about frequency
dependent selection, where

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,310
we could get, in this case, that
species 1 dominates or species

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,329
2 dominates, 1 or 2.

68
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,620
But then we could also get
coexistence or bi-stability.

69
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,620

70
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,460
And indeed, there
is, in general,

71
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,770
a mapping from the
Lotka-Volterra kind of approach

72
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,560
here and the approach that
was kind of in Martin Nonwak's

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,444
book of thinking about
frequency dependent selection

74
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,235
in this population.

75
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:23,080

76
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,790
And so then it's not
a surprise that you

77
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,920
get the same four outcomes
between these two situations.

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,260
And I think that this
is also highlighting

79
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,850
some very interesting and deep
connections between evolution,

80
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,910
which is changes in, say,
allele frequency in a population

81
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,020
of a single species,
over time, and then

82
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,250
some of these ecological kind of
processes, where you're really

83
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
thinking about these
as different species.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,440

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,947
Now, of course, in the case
of the evolutionary dynamics

86
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,780
that we analyze Martin's
book, though, those

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,220
were the evolution of
different clonal populations

88
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,487
in asexually
reproducing populations.

89
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,320
Do you guys remember
what I'm talking about?

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,950
All right.

91
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,619
So I just want to draw a couple
of these sorts of diagrams.

92
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,410
I'm not going to draw
out all four of them,

93
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,220
because it does take some time.

94
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,990
But hopefully, we can
reconstruct where we were.

95
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,710

96
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:33,590
The case that we were analyzing
before, the N1 dot equals 0.

97
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,280
We're going to have
it as a dashed line.

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,640
And N2 is going to
be-- well, maybe

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,040
we'll try to use thick chalk.

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,380
Oh, wow, I missed.

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,860
These are thick lines.

102
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,310
So we'll draw these
nullclines over here.

103
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,470
So the N1 dot-- and
indeed, one of the comments

104
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,920
is that it would be nice to
draw where the nullclines are

105
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,330
on the axes as well.

106
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,410
And indeed, we can do that.

107
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,800
We aim to please.

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,530
So the dashed lines correspond
to N1 dot being to 0.

109
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,600
So here's N1, N2.

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,520
So N1 equal to 0
corresponds to this thing.

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,480

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,260
And then we have this other
guy that's a line, here.

113
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,660

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,230
Now what we found is
that, if N2 is equal to 0,

115
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:33,650
this intersects at K1, whereas
the intersection over here

116
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,050
is at K1 divided by beta 12.

117
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,330

118
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,390
Now, we have our
other nullclines

119
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,160
that correspond to
N2 dot equal to 0.

120
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,770
Now one of those lines is
indeed going to be along here.

121
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,410

122
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,570
And the other line
can fall-- there

123
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,510
are four different
possibilities for how

124
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,780
we might draw it in relation
to this N1 dot equal to 0

125
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,420
nullcline.

126
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,640
And depending on the
orientation of that,

127
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,760
we'll end up getting these four
different possible outcomes

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,170
of 1 dominating, irrespective
of the initial conditions,

129
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,950
2 dominating, irrespective
of initial conditions,

130
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,440
or coexistence or bi-stability.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,940
So bi-stability is
the only-- so if you

132
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,220
start with a finite number
of each of these two species,

133
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,090
then bi-stability is the only
case where the outcome depends

134
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,490
on the starting condition.

135
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,400
So, of course, if you start out
without one of the two species,

136
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,640
then you won't get creation
of those species, right?

137
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,060
Because the only way to
get creation of species 1

138
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,650
is to have some species 1
individual in this model.

139
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,790

140
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,080
So we're going to get another
line, here, corresponding to N2

141
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,740
dot equal to 0.

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,790
And I think that the one that
we were trying to analyze

143
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,120
was with the solid
line underneath.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,390
Is that consistent
with people's notes?

145
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,195
So we can draw some
other line here.

146
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:06,580
It doesn't have
to the same slope.

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,419
Now it's good to be
clear about where

148
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,710
these things are going to fall.

149
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,190
So K2 is this point.

150
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,450
And now K2 divided by
beta 21 is over here.

151
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,730
Now recall that beta
12 is telling us

152
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,640
about how much
species 2 is reducing

153
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,570
the growth of species 1.

154
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,217
Whereas beta 21 is
how much species

155
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:29,800
1 is reducing the
growth of species 2.

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,290

157
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,240
Now, everything comes down
to the relative ordering

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,724
of these two quantities
and these two quantities.

159
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,640
And since there are two
possibilities on each,

160
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,348
that gives us the four
possible outcomes.

161
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:44,820

162
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,290
And broadly, the idea
here is just that,

163
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,130
if the species are weakly
interfering with each other,

164
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,130
then what should happen?

165
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,449

166
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,990
Yes, then you should
get coexistence.

167
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,860
Coexistence is when
the betas are small.

168
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,846
Of course, this is
a concrete model,

169
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,720
so you have to define
what you mean by small.

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,450
And indeed, small
here ends up being

171
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,740
relative to the ratios of
these carrying capacities.

172
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,710
If the carrying capacities
are just equal to, say, 1,

173
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,670
then that's saying
that the betas-- sorry,

174
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,595
if the carrying capacities are
the same, then the simple way

175
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,470
to think about this is
just whether the betas

176
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,390
are larger or smaller than 1,
whether each species interferes

177
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,940
with the other species more than
a member of that other species.

178
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,346

179
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:41,970
So if carrying
capacities are the same,

180
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,600
that's what demarcates
the different zones.

181
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,440
So what we want to do is
take this sort of diagram

182
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
and try to figure out where
will the trajectories be

183
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,970
on this diagram?

184
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,440
Now, it's always good to
locate the fixed points.

185
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,150
The fixed points
of the system are?

186
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,250
And somebody, words?

187
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,190
How would we define fixed
points in this system?

188
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

189
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:10,620
PROFESSOR: What's that?

190
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,786
Both lines intersect, right?

191
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,150
So when the dashed line
intersects the solid lines,

192
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,950
right?

193
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,380
So we have one such
fixed point here.

194
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,666
We have another fixed point here
and another fixed point here.

195
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,046

196
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,420
Have we figured
out the stability

197
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,460
of those fixed points?

198
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,960
No.

199
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,997

200
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:36,705
What's the stability
of this fixed point?

201
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:42,175

202
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,050
It's unstable, right?

203
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,760
Because we've
already, previously

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,784
assumed that these r's
are greater than 0.

205
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:51,450
We're assuming that
the species would be

206
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,590
able to survive on their own.

207
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,520
And that's actually
true for both species.

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,000
So this thing is unstable kind
of in both directions, right?

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,770
And what are the
eigenvectors associated

210
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,686
with this fixed point?

211
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,420

212
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,910
On the count of three,
draw, use your arms

213
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,400
like the hands of a clock
to indicate the directions

214
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,210
of the eigenvectors.

215
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,180
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

216
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,714
All right, all right.

217
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:24,880
There's no diagonals, right?

218
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,520

219
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,780
Of course, you could also.

220
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,450
I was waiting for somebody to
be kind of obnoxious and point

221
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,900
in the other direction.

222
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,086
A surprisingly not
obnoxious class we have.

223
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:38,960
So this is just saying
that, if you start out

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,290
just a little bit
of one species,

225
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,748
you'll just stay
with that species.

226
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,490
It makes sense.

227
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,330
Now, what do these lines
tell us about the directions

228
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:53,827
of the trajectories
or the orientations

229
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:54,660
of the trajectories?

230
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:03,990

231
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,990
Why did I draw them?

232
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,500

233
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes?

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,360

235
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,175
AUDIENCE: These
trajectories are--

236
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,055
these are lines are nonlines.

237
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:20,440
And one of the
derivatives [INAUDIBLE].

238
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,495

239
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,370
PROFESSOR: One of the
derivatives, all right.

240
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,810
And in particular, let's
look at this line here.

241
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,310
Are the trajectories?

242
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,000
Again, we're going
to do our arms

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,410
to indicate the orientation
of the trajectories.

244
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,790
In particular, there's
a trajectory right here.

245
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,900
What direction will that
trajectory be pointing?

246
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,460
There's only going
to be one arm.

247
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,670
Ready, three, two, one.

248
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,990
All right, we got a lot
of people not voting.

249
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,560
All right, that means we need to
turn our neighbors and discuss.

250
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,710
If you didn't vote,
it means, I think,

251
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,002
not following what
we're talking about.

252
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:04,710
Turn to somebody.

253
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,560

254
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,849
If your neighbor agrees with
you about which direction

255
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,390
you should be pointing
your arm, then

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,680
try to figure out
whether we know

257
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,301
which orientation the arrow
should actually be in.

258
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,460
[SIDE DISCUSSIONS]

259
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:47,515

260
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:48,890
PROFESSOR: We'll
figure this out.

261
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,292
[SIDE DISCUSSIONS]

262
00:12:52,292 --> 00:13:02,684

263
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,350
PROFESSOR: Let's go
ahead and reconvene,

264
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,580
because it seems like some
people are being quiet.

265
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,540
But I'm not sure if
that's because they think

266
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,600
they know what's going on or
they're just very much unhappy

267
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,440
with the situation.

268
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,460
Let me see a fresh voting.

269
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,775
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

270
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,312

271
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,020
Definitely, it's going
up or down, right?

272
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,870
Because the definition of this
dashed line is that N1 dot

273
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,680
is equal to 0.

274
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,544
We don't know what N2 dot is.

275
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,960
We'll figure that
out in a moment.

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,100
But what we know is
that the trajectories

277
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,180
we should be something, lines
here, either up or down.

278
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,320
And we're going to find
that they're down but here.

279
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,369
Now, on this solid line,
quickly, the orientation of

280
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:47,910
trajectories.

281
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,900
Ready, three, two, one.

282
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,930
All right, perfect.

283
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,870
So we know that
N2 dot is 0 here.

284
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,860

285
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,150
Now, an actual direction of
the trajectory, at this point,

286
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,230
right here.

287
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,050
Ready, three, two, one.

288
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,370
OK, good.

289
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,776
Because in the
absence of N2, we know

290
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:13,150
that species N1 should just
come to carrying capacity K1.

291
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,880

292
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,760
Same thing over here, we
should get arrows coming down.

293
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,500
So indeed, what you can see is
that the arrows are coming down

294
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,650
here.

295
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,024
That means they actually do
have to come down immediately

296
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,825
to the right of them.

297
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,200
Whereas over here,
the trajectory

298
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,310
is point right here, so
we can kind of figure out

299
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,780
that-- so they're coming here.

300
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
And from far away,
they're coming here.

301
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,630
And you can see that they
have to come across here.

302
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,740
And then they're going
to come into this point.

303
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,010
So this is going to be
our stable fixed point.

304
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,371
I'll color it in
to indicate that.

305
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:53,370
From here, they're going
to curve around though.

306
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,085
So if you start out right here,
you kind of do this business.

307
00:14:56,085 --> 00:15:05,140

308
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,810
From here, we come in.

309
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,580

310
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,990
Are these lines allowed
to cross each other?

311
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,490
No.

312
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:23,290

313
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,330
Now, indeed, you
could actually see

314
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,960
here, what is the direction
of the other eigenvector

315
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,180
at this point?

316
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,640
Using a hand, arm,
ready, three, two, one.

317
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,299
Right, it's kind of
something in there.

318
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,590
Because there's all these
trajectories are coming here,

319
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,420
and then they approach this
fixed point from this point.

320
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,360
Because here, the
other eigenvector

321
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,110
is still horizontal, right?

322
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,180
Because we know, if we don't
have N2, then we just have N1.

323
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,662
But this other eigenvector
is not purely straight up.

324
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,870
The other one is along here,
because the trajectories

325
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,310
are coming in along that.

326
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,010
Does that make sense?

327
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,900
So in this case, we
should just be clear.

328
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,050
We are in a situation
where K1 over beta 12

329
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,460
is greater than K2.

330
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,740

331
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,580
Another way of writing that is
that beta 12 is less than K1

332
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,770
over K2.

333
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:29,930
So that means species 2 does
not strongly harm species 1.

334
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,930
Yet, we know that K1 is greater
than K2 divided by beta 21.

335
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,120
So that means that beta 21
is greater than K2 over K1.

336
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,250
This is telling us that
species 1 is strongly

337
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,625
harming species 2.

338
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,520
And that makes sense.

339
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,420
In that case, species 1 wins.

340
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,290

341
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,430
Does that outcome change
if we change the r values,

342
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,520
the division rates?

343
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,900

344
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,960
A is yes.

345
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,950
B is no.

346
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,390
I'm going to give
you 10 seconds.

347
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,219
What I just said, if
I change r's does that

348
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:16,010
change the outcome?

349
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,575
Ready, three, two, one.

350
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,165

351
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:25,710
So we've got a majority
of B. So the answer is no.

352
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:37,506
This statement that, in this
situation, species 1 dominates,

353
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:38,755
that's independent of the r's.

354
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:44,112

355
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:45,570
And what you see
is the conditions,

356
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,350
here, only depend on
the what's in here.

357
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,390
So the actual shape of those
trajectories will depend upon

358
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:51,920
the r's.

359
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,520

360
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,420
So if it's the case
that species 2 is just

361
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,921
a faster grower than
species 1, then you

362
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,420
might end up with
a situation where,

363
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,045
if you start with a
little bit of each,

364
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,940
you might come way
up here-- well, no.

365
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,196
I guess you might come
close to this fixed point.

366
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:11,820
So you might think
that it really looks

367
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,390
like species 2 is about to win.

368
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,500
But eventually, they'll
curve over and come back.

369
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,930
And indeed, in the Strogatz
book, one of the chapters

370
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,770
that I recommended, he has an
example of sheeps and rabbits,

371
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,560
the idea is that they
are competing species,

372
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,884
maybe eating similar foods.

373
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,050
I don't know if that's true.

374
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,410
But the rabbits can
divide more rapidly.

375
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,750
So here, the idea would be,
well, if the sheep can really

376
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,930
displace the rabbits,
because it's just bigger

377
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,650
and push them aside,
then what can happen

378
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,892
is that the rabbits
first divide rapidly.

379
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,600
It looks like they're
going to take over,

380
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,379
but, over time, eventually,
the sheep population kind of

381
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,170
grow up, and they start
displacing rabbits.

382
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,770
And you end up
excluding the rabbits.

383
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,130
This is this phenomenon
of competitive exclusion.

384
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,570

385
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:06,570
And depending upon the
context-- OK, that's an e--

386
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,790
this is either more or less
maybe formally phrased.

387
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,210
But the idea is that, if
there are two species that

388
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,026
are too similar,
and in particular,

389
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,650
if they're somehow
perfect competitors,

390
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,060
they're really just trying
to eat the same thing,

391
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,850
then you should
only end up with one

392
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,370
of the two species surviving.

393
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,220
And that's the
kind of idea here.

394
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,840
Although, I think, you can
argue about the mapping I think.

395
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,205
So this is one of
the four outcomes.

396
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,360

397
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,979
And of course, it
takes 15 minutes

398
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,520
to go through each
of these examples.

399
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,430
So we're not going to
go through all of them.

400
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,280
But you should be
able to, for a given

401
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,600
a combination of betas and
K's, be able to figure out,

402
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,410
using some combination
of algebra, derivatives,

403
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,185
fixed point stability analyses,
and drawing of things, well,

404
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,935
you should be able to
do all of the above.

405
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:03,720

406
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,805
Are there any questions
about where we are here?

407
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:13,512

408
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,970
AUDIENCE: I guess
that none of this

409
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,571
holds in the
stochastic [INAUDIBLE].

410
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an interesting question.

411
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,762
AUDIENCE: For example, in that
case, if r2 is much bigger,

412
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:28,063
then you're going get almost,
very close to like K2,

413
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:31,615
and then maybe just the
last individual [INAUDIBLE]

414
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,530
and then you just
add that fixed point.

415
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,520
PROFESSOR: Right.

416
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,660
So it's certainly the
case that, once you

417
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,690
have stochastic
extinction-- the thing is

418
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,839
that, you would probably
be most susceptible

419
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,880
to stochastic extinction.

420
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,300
In the case you
were talking about,

421
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,920
you would be most susceptible
to stochastic extinction

422
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,760
when you're around
here, actually.

423
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:58,800
These trajectories are still
always moving up in N1 space.

424
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,700
I think I know
what you're saying.

425
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,300
We're going to maybe
zoom in onto this N1, N2.

426
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,780
Because we have this
unstable fixed point here.

427
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,190
And the claim was that, if
you start out over here,

428
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,500
then the trajectory might
look something like this.

429
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
And you'd say, oh, well,
you might go extinct here.

430
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,850
AUDIENCE: The idea
was just the statement

431
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,620
that [INAUDIBLE] r1, r2 are
very dynamical [INAUDIBLE].

432
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,380

433
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,150
PROFESSOR: It's true that,
I guess, things change.

434
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,320
There are a number of things
you might want to say.

435
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,540
First of all, this is a purely
continuous and deterministic

436
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,090
description of the setting.

437
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,670
It allows for
fractional individuals.

438
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,440
There's no shocks
or perturbations

439
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,016
that you have to worry about.

440
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:55,640
I guess the only
thing I wanted to say,

441
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,790
in regards to your
question, is that I

442
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,739
think the stochastic extinction
will not be dominated.

443
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:04,030
We're talking about stochastic
extinction of species 1.

444
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,529
It will not be dominated due
to a stochastic extinction here

445
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,820
but stochastic extinction
at the beginning.

446
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,920
I haven't drawn this very,
very well, but, in this case,

447
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,580
I think these
trajectories are always

448
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,900
are going up in numbers
of the 1 species, which

449
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,910
means that you're most
likely to experience

450
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,048
stochastic extinction
at the beginning.

451
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:25,548
Yeah?

452
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:28,008
AUDIENCE: r1 and r2
should still really

453
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,468
mess with stochastic
extinction a lot, right?

454
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:35,830
Because the larger r1
and r2 are the quicker

455
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,670
we get out of the regime
of stochastic extinction.

456
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,140
PROFESSOR: That's all true.

457
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,420

458
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,420
We have to be careful
about many of these things.

459
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,350
In particular, if you go and
you do a stochastic simulation

460
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,420
of this, so let's say you plug
this thing into a Gillespie

461
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,430
simulation, can you get
stochastic extinction?

462
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,900
A yes, or B no, ready,
three, two, one.

463
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,020
No.

464
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,748
So the answer is no but why?

465
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:12,666
AUDIENCE: It depends.

466
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:16,810
If you take r
combination [INAUDIBLE].

467
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,790
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

468
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,555
So right now, as written,
there's no death.

469
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:22,577

470
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:24,660
Although, I guess you could
say that this a death.

471
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,710

472
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,420
There's a question of
how you partition things.

473
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,850
So in principle, this is the
difference between the growth

474
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,450
and the death rate.

475
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,640
But the most straightforward
way of doing such a simulation

476
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,220
is that you put this whole thing
in here as a rate for birth.

477
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,732

478
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:50,065
Somebody is going to say, ah,
that's not how I was going

479
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:51,267
to do the simulation, right?

480
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:53,350
Well, that's probably how
you were going to do it.

481
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,850
AUDIENCE: That's a terrible way.

482
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,670
PROFESSOR: But if you did
that, if there's only birth,

483
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,020
then you can't get stochastic
extinction, obviously.

484
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,829
But in general-- and
this is one of things

485
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:03,370
we spend our time
a lot time thinking

486
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,040
about in this semester--
there are multiple ways

487
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,410
of doing kind of a
stochastic simulation

488
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,420
from a deterministic equation.

489
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,966
And this thing, you
could be more explicit

490
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,340
and say, oh, this
thing is really

491
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,625
a B2 minus a D2, so a birth rate
minus a death rate for example.

492
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,750
And form the standpoint of
a differential equation,

493
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,280
it doesn't make any difference.

494
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,160
But if you do the
Fokker-Planck approximation

495
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,520
or you do a
simulation or whatnot,

496
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
then these lead to
different things.

497
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,970
In particular, the rate of,
say, stochastic extinction

498
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,650
here increases as B and D
increase, because that leads

499
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,095
to more of these fluctuations.

500
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:44,560

501
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,911
So there are many things that
are different once you include

502
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:49,910
the stochastic dynamics.

503
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,450
But it's always good to get
a base sense of the dynamics

504
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,910
from the standpoint of just
deterministic differential

505
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,860
equations before you think
too much about the stochastic

506
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,304
dynamics, because otherwise
you get overwhelmed quickly.

507
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:08,180

508
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,370
Any other questions about that?

509
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:25,510

510
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,880
What I want to do is just
spend a little bit of time

511
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,890
to think about the more
generalized case of more

512
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,390
species.

513
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:40,280

514
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,970
And in particular, we could
convert this set of equations.

515
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,600
We can normalize by each of
their carrying capacities.

516
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,394
And we can convert
a set of equations

517
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,560
to look something like this.

518
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,760
So now we just have Xi
dot is equal to-- there's

519
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,850
some ri Xi, 1 minus.

520
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,270
And what we can actually
do is normalize everything

521
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,950
so that it's just
written like this.

522
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,220

523
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,020
And normally, what we
assume is that we've

524
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,990
done things such that alpha
i i is equal to 1 for all i.

525
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,760
So this is just saying that
this is the normalization such

526
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,450
that each species
inhibits itself in a way

527
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,060
that it's just give a
simple logistic growth.

528
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,545
And it's going to be logistic
growth with a carrying

529
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:41,980
capacity equal to 1.

530
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,130
And then once you've
done that, then a species

531
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,720
inhibits itself
with alpha i i 1.

532
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,210
And then everything comes down
to what this alpha matrix is.

533
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,720

534
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,380
And I would say that, as
always, it's really very, very

535
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,180
important that you
can go back and forth

536
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,920
between the non-dimensionalized
versions of equations

537
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,420
and the base version.

538
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,280
This was something that,
on exam number two,

539
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:21,720
there were quite a lot of
problems where we asked about,

540
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,260
how does the
parameter change when

541
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,760
you change the strength of
expression or this or that,

542
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,620
right?

543
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,880
So this is something that
I think is very important.

544
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,380
Because this comes up a lot.

545
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,100

546
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,020
So in this case,
the alpha matrix

547
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,330
tells you kind of everything.

548
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,270
And then there are
a number of things

549
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,450
that, well, the
mathematicians have proven

550
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,742
about these sorts of equations.

551
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:45,116
And I just want to point you
towards some of those things

552
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:45,960
to think about.

553
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,590
So first, I'm considering a
case where, again, alpha i

554
00:27:52,590 --> 00:28:01,290
j is greater than 0,
again, for all i and ji,

555
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,810
or greater than or equal to 0.

556
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,310

557
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,240
So some of them can be 0.

558
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,055
But the interactions, when
they exist, are competitive.

559
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:16,360

560
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,040
So first, if you start
out in the region where

561
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,850
all of the species start,
between 0 and 1, then

562
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,150
you stay in that region.

563
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,340

564
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,100
If this is true initially,
then it will be true forever.

565
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,590

566
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,550
That's good.

567
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,560
Negative abundances, you maybe
were not so worried about.

568
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,050
But it's not as obvious that
you can't get above one,

569
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,440
because there's nothing
saying that, in principle, you

570
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,090
couldn't have
started there, right?

571
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,939
Or in principle, you
couldn't have gotten there?

572
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:58,480
And certainly, it's
physical to think

573
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,063
about starting outside
of that region,

574
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:02,170
because we often talk
about carrying capacities

575
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,211
as something that's like.

576
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:06,830

577
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,146
If you think about, this is
an Xi as a function of time.

578
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:13,096

579
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:15,720
So in these situations, it's not
crazy to think about something

580
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,017
above the carrying capacity.

581
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,350
But this mathematical statement
about the Latka-Volterra

582
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,650
framework is that,
if you start out

583
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,500
with everything below
its carrying capacity,

584
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
then everything will
always stay there.

585
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,810

586
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:42,060
And all the dynamics occur--
this is for i equal to 1 to N

587
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,710
Do I want to use a
big N or little n?

588
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,420
Does it matter?

589
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,840

590
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,750
So this is big N,
different species.

591
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,650
The dynamics occur on
an N minus one manifold.

592
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,150
If we have many
mathematicians, they

593
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,270
can explain what this
technically means.

594
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,760
But basically,
what it's saying is

595
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,945
that there's going to be some
N minus 1 dimensional surface

596
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:09,660
or volume or whatnot
where all the dynamics are

597
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,980
going end up being on.

598
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,920
And what that means is that,
in particular, a limit cycle

599
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:28,440
requires two
dimensions, requires

600
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,510
2D, which means that
to get a limit cycle

601
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,990
requires-- so then N has to
be greater than or equal to 3

602
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,320
to get a limit cycle.

603
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,500
Can you see what I'm saying?

604
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,897
Whereas chaos
requires 3D, and that

605
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,980
means that N has to be
greater than or equal to 4.

606
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,980

607
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,941
And indeed, you can get limit
cycles with N equal to 3.

608
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:58,440
And you get chaos
with N equal to 4.

609
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,796

610
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,170
There's another
theorem that says

611
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:10,360
that any dynamics are possible
for N equal to 5 or larger.

612
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,550
And chaos seems as much as
I would want to ask for.

613
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:20,620
But there's,
apparently, a 4D torus,

614
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,764
something that is different.

615
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:24,930
This is something to think
about in your spare time.

616
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:33,010

617
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,900
Well, you know, like
a lot of things.

618
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,440
And this is worth spending
a moment talking about.

619
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,550
First of all, so here's
a two dimensional thing.

620
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,550
The special thing, as
you might remember,

621
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,950
about continuous dynamics is
that these trajectories are not

622
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,670
allowed to cross
each other, right?

623
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,990
Which means that you just can't
draw a chaotic trajectory,

624
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,210
because you're going to have
to cross yourself again.

625
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,550
And that's also why a
limit cycle requires two,

626
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,070
because we originally tried
to draw a limit cycle in one

627
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,400
dimension, and it didn't work.

628
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,080
Do you remember this?

629
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,360
And the same thing with--
you can imagine, here's

630
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,959
a nice limit cycle.

631
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,000
And that could be stable.

632
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,730

633
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,770
Oh, and incidentally,
you were right about.

634
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,440
I was getting confused about
the Poincare-Bendixson theorem.

635
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,390
Because I think there
are these funny things.

636
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,280
It wasn't.

637
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,065
OK, well, you know,
all these people

638
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,890
that complain about what I say.

639
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,499
Because if you have the
trajectories coming in,

640
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,040
then what I said was that, if
you had an unstable fixed point

641
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,950
coming out, then you
could draw this region,

642
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,575
then you could be
guaranteed that there

643
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:47,930
was a limit cycle in there.

644
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,887
But you cannot, just based
on what I had said, say that,

645
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,220
if it's a stable fixed point,
then you won't get a limit

646
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,140
cycle.

647
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,820
I mean in some other cases you
can prove that it doesn't work.

648
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,570
Particularly, like in
the Latka-Volterra,

649
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,439
there in one of
the crossings, it's

650
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,980
now going to be a
stable fixed point.

651
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,800
In that situation, you
can prove, mathematically,

652
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,420
that you can never get a
limit cycle oscillation

653
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,670
because of some divergence
condition of some function

654
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,311
and so forth.

655
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:20,310
But in the example that
I was telling you about,

656
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,870
in the predator-prey, it was
true in that particular case

657
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,569
that, when that thing is stable,
you don't get oscillations.

658
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:27,860
And when it's unstable, you do.

659
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,734
But both directions
do not follow

660
00:33:29,734 --> 00:33:30,900
from the Poincare-Bendixson.

661
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,580

662
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,540
This is a limit cycle.

663
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,020
Now, in a chaotic situation, you
have to be able to do something

664
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,440
where you kind of
come around and then,

665
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,190
every now and then,
you kind go over here.

666
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,410
And then you go
around and around.

667
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,970
Something crazy happens.

668
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,720
But you can see that
this situation doesn't

669
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,450
work if it's only 2D, right?

670
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,430
Do you see why I'm saying that?

671
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

672
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,380
PROFESSOR: You don't?

673
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,040
You don't agree.

674
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,436
It's just, if it's 2D, then
these lines cannot cross.

675
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:06,810
So you need to a
third dimension,

676
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,730
so that they can just shoot
above and below each other.

677
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,505
AUDIENCE: And what's
with the definition?

678
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,790
Because you can come
up with trajectories,

679
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,639
like you can have trajectories
that asymptotically approach

680
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,112
the limit cycle but that
never cross themselves, right?

681
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:21,778
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

682
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:23,920
AUDIENCE: Those are obviously
not chaotic, but the y--

683
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,628
PROFESSOR: Right.

684
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,989

685
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,310
So this is not actually
class in non-linear dynamics,

686
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,139
so we're not.

687
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,510
So normally, you characterize
this Lyapunov exponent,

688
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,642
which tells you about
how the phase space is

689
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:36,850
kind of growing or shrinking.

690
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,725
In the case that you
were just talking about,

691
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,150
that's a case where all the
trajectories come together.

692
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,774
Because in this case where this
trajectory comes into the limit

693
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:46,920
cycle, if you draw like
a blob of phase space,

694
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,020
it's going to come
together over time.

695
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,480
Whereas in a chaotic system, if
you have a blob of phase space,

696
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,409
it's going to diverge and
fold and do all the craziness.

697
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,289

698
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:01,992
Yes?

699
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:03,867
AUDIENCE: So you said
[INAUDIBLE] essentially

700
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,145
you need n greater
than or equal to 3.

701
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,100
Is that just for this--

702
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,021
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

703
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:10,520
Yes.

704
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,920
So this is in this
Latka-Volterra.

705
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,700
Because, in general, you
can get a limit cycle

706
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,040
with two equations.

707
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,150
And that's with the 2D.

708
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,270
And in general, you get a
chaos with three equations

709
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,890
or three variables.

710
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,870
But in the Latka-Volterra model,
it requires three and four,

711
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,990
respectively.

712
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,139
That doesn't mean that
every four species

713
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,430
Latka-Volterra will have chaos.

714
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,221
But it means that it's
possible to get one.

715
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:39,059

716
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,100
And I think one thing
that's just rather striking

717
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,830
is that this really is kind of
the simplest, possible model

718
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,870
you can ever write
down describing

719
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,587
how species might
interact or variables

720
00:35:52,587 --> 00:35:53,670
might interact or whatnot.

721
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,630
And so it's really kind
of incredible to me

722
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,800
that you get all
these crazy dynamics.

723
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,205

724
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:00,705
Yes?

725
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,200
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask
about the n minus 1 thing.

726
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,415
This dynamic [INAUDIBLE]
n minus 1 [INAUDIBLE].

727
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,081
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

728
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,705
AUDIENCE: Over here
it just looks to me

729
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:11,464
like-- we have n equals
2 and the dynamics

730
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:17,004
are occuring on a plane,
on a two-dimensional plane.

731
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:17,670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

732
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,280

733
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,860
The transience or
whatever can occur.

734
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,050
It requires the full N
dimensions to describe.

735
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,890
Because you can
start-- to describe

736
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,120
all of the trajectories, clearly
requires all dimensions, right?

737
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,670
Because anywhere
you start, you have

738
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,550
to have specify it
by five dimensions.

739
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,870
But the dynamics, as
far as like-- and here,

740
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,300
there aren't even any dynamics.

741
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,290
I think that you go to a point.

742
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,571

743
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,565
AUDIENCE: What do
you mean by dynamics?

744
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:55,680
[INAUDIBLE]

745
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,480
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I agree that there

746
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,850
is a-- so in the case
of the limit cycles

747
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:07,410
and so forth, this is really
like, at steady state,

748
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,830
it's doing something.

749
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,640
So here, steady state, it
only goes to the fixed points.

750
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,639

751
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,430
But if you have a three
dimensional system,

752
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,890
then you can have it steady
state, the trajectories

753
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,070
on like a plane.

754
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:30,620

755
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,120
Yeah?

756
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,347
AUDIENCE: Is it because
there's like some concept

757
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:39,550
of [INAUDIBLE] that can be
[INAUDIBLE] for the system?

758
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,100
PROFESSOR: I don't think
that that-- I'm not

759
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,800
aware of that being the case.

760
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,605
But I'm hesitant to
say that it's not true.

761
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:55,750

762
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,160
I want to switch
gears a little bit

763
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,389
and think about three
species interactions

764
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:03,430
and, in particular the
three species interactions

765
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,460
when they're non-transitive.

766
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,120
Because this is thought
to be potentially

767
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,355
a significant stabilizer for
diversity in populations.

768
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:28,388

769
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:36,240
So this is non-transitive
interactions.

770
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,990
And we often just say
rock-paper-scissors.

771
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:44,630

772
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,130
Is everybody from a cultural
that plays rock-paper-scissors?

773
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:52,410

774
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:52,956
Yes?

775
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:53,580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

776
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,580
PROFESSOR: So this is a
true, human universal.

777
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,015
Although I think that what we
call it does vary and so forth.

778
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:02,180
You know how sometimes
the linguists

779
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,310
try to find this ur-language
that our ancestors spoke

780
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,590
50,000 years ago or whatever?

781
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,250
I think that you
probably do something

782
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,625
similar with
rock-paper-scissors,

783
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:14,300
because it seems to be
a pretty common theme.

784
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,710
But the idea here is
that you have-- wait,

785
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,810
which direction does it go?

786
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,610
So paper beats rock,
scissors beats paper,

787
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,574
but rock beats the scissors.

788
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:30,460

789
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,570
So you can imagine that
this kind of dynamic

790
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:38,000
can be captured in the
Latka-Volterra type framework.

791
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,480
So you just have to set
up these betas or alphas

792
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,900
so that this is true.

793
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,500
And again, the way
to think about this

794
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,280
would be-- the simplest thing is
to think about it as dominance.

795
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,250
So if you have the rock
species and the scissor species

796
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,050
together, then the rock species
will drive the scissor species

797
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,900
extinct and so forth.

798
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,080
Now, this is the
kind of situation

799
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,600
that, in principle, can lead
to very complicated dynamics

800
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,240
in multi-species ecosystems
that, at least in many models,

801
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,720
can stabilize the coexistence
of multiple species via some

802
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,930
of these complex, crazy
dynamics that we were just

803
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,690
talking about.

804
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,210
I would say that, as a
mechanism for the stabilization

805
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,630
of diversity, I don't
know how convincing

806
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,240
that is in terms of being what
explains why it is there's

807
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,970
so much diversity outside, when
you look outside the window.

808
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,970
But, at least, it's
in principle true.

809
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,966
And one of the topics
of these papers--

810
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,340
certainly the one
you just read--

811
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,880
is that
rock-paper-scissors, i.e.

812
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,220
non-transitive
interactions on their own,

813
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,082
may not be sufficient,
but, in the presence

814
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,540
of spatial structure,
maybe it does

815
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,750
allow for long-term coexistence
of these species or strategies

816
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,430
and so forth.

817
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,680
And again, it's not always
clear in these situations

818
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,560
whether you're
thinking about ecology,

819
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,976
where these are
different species,

820
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,720
or you're thinking
about evolution, where

821
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,570
these are different genotypes.

822
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,090
And indeed, in the Kerr
paper that you read,

823
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,407
these are all E. coli.

824
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,240
So it's all one species,
it's just that they

825
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,270
have different mutations.

826
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,360
So that's really
rock-paper-scissors

827
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,630
in the context of evolution.

828
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,560
Whereas in the male
mating strategies

829
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,120
paper by Curt Lively, that's
more of an ecological context,

830
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,540
but it still is evolution
within the species.

831
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,910
Because these mating
strategies are heritable.

832
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:36,750

833
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,850
I did tell you the base idea
of this lizard mating strategy

834
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,386
business?

835
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:44,010
Or did I never say
anything about that?

836
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,850
Not really?

837
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,690
OK.

838
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,900
For some reason, I thought
that I'd alluded to it.

839
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,960
Well, let me explain it to you.

840
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,800
I think it's kind of
an incredible paper.

841
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,990
So this is a paper
by my Curt Lively.

842
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,010
So it's Sinervo and Lively.

843
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,970

844
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,220
It was Nature in '96.

845
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:11,970

846
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,010
And it's called "The
Rock-Paper-Scissors

847
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,450
Game and the Evolution of
Alternative Male Strategies."

848
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,550
So what was known
is that there are

849
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,660
many examples of alternative
mating strategies in males.

850
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,810
In particular, it's rather
common that there are,

851
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:34,310
what you might call,
territorial males

852
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,620
and what they often
call sneaker males.

853
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,930

854
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,180
This is observed in fish
and various land animals.

855
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,960
And in many of the cases,
these sneaker males

856
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,655
really do look
phenotypically like females.

857
00:42:51,655 --> 00:43:04,490

858
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,750
And this has been measured
using various kinds

859
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,980
of observational,
experimental approaches.

860
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
There's often what you
call negative frequency

861
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,150
dependent selection
between these strategies.

862
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,180

863
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,340
The sneakers can
often, when rare,

864
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,050
spread in population of the
territorial and vice versa.

865
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,350
But this was, at the
least the first case

866
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,230
I'm aware of where these
ideas had been demonstrated,

867
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,920
that there were really
three strategies.

868
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,880
And the three
strategies implemented,

869
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,620
one of these rock-paper-scissors
interactions.

870
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,987
I want to maybe make
a little more space.

871
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:42,570
If you guys are
available after class,

872
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,267
I encourage you to come
up and look at the paper,

873
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:47,100
because they actually
have pictures of them,

874
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,250
so you can identify
the sneaker males.

875
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,420
Because they actually
look different

876
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,470
based on the coloring
of their throat.

877
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,910
So these are lizards that live
in the mountains up outside

878
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,310
of the Bay Area in
California, in Merced County.

879
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,790
They're side-blotched lizards.

880
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,470
I don't know
anything about that.

881
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,190
And what they showed
was that there's

882
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:23,920
these guys with orange throats
that are kind of aggressive.

883
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,820
And they defend a
very large territory

884
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,190
with a large number of females.

885
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,250
And they fight off
any males that come.

886
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:40,250
Then there are the dark blue.

887
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,130

888
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,960
Sorry, I should have
put that over here.

889
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,450
So there are other lizards here
that are dark blue throats.

890
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,700
And these guys are less
aggressive with smaller

891
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,200
territories.

892
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,080

893
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,260
So you can guess, if it were
just the orange-throated guys

894
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,280
and the dark-- and these are
genetically encoded strategies,

895
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,870
in the sense that they
do seem to be passed on,

896
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,930
and it's determined by the genes
that the male inherits-- less

897
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,740
aggressive and small territory.

898
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,979
Can you guess which one
wins between these two,

899
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:21,770
against each other?

900
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,410

901
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:25,910
What's that?

902
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,540
AUDIENCE: The two
aggressive ones

903
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,123
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but if you just
have the two aggressive ones?

904
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:30,940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

905
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,320
PROFESSOR: This guy's going
to beat this one, right?

906
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,760
That's just because this
aggressive male has a larger

907
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,400
territory, and they
pass on more genes

908
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,324
than the less aggressive ones.

909
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:44,990
However, what they found is that
there's a third mating strategy

910
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,920
here, which are
these sneaker males.

911
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,640
And they indeed look
like the females.

912
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:59,210
They have these yellow
stripes on their throats.

913
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:01,740
They look like the female,
and they have no territory.

914
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,330
Sneaker males, so they
don't defend any territory.

915
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,850
Instead, they just
sneak into the territory

916
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,040
of the other males
and try to mate

917
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,540
with the females
in that territory.

918
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,270
And what they show is that,
over the course of seven years,

919
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,304
in the mountains
of Merced, they see

920
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:21,720
that the frequency
of these things

921
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,950
goes through an
entire oscillation.

922
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:31,280
So they see just over one
period of this oscillation.

923
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,560
And their argument is
that, although it's true

924
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,090
that the aggressive males can
outcompete the less aggressive

925
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,990
ones, the sneakers
actually outcompete

926
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,700
these aggressive
ones, basically,

927
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,527
because these
aggressive males, it's

928
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:47,110
just too large of a
territory for them

929
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,670
to effectively defend it.

930
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,370
So the sneakers can
actually outcompete

931
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,530
the aggressive males.

932
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,120
Yet the less aggressive ones
can outcompete the sneakers,

933
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,980
because they are trying to
defend a smaller territory.

934
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,910
So they basically
measured the frequency

935
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,980
of these strategies and
also the number of females

936
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:16,670
in the different territories,
from 1990 to '96 or so,

937
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,250
and saw that this thing kind
of went around in some circle

938
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,780
in this frequency space of
alternative male strategies.

939
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:31,280

940
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,520
Kind of an incredible paper.

941
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,750
So the idea here is this
is a situation where

942
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,284
it is non-transitive.

943
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:41,950
So there's this
rock-paper-scissors type

944
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:42,600
dynamic.

945
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,877
And it's also spatial,
because these lizards are

946
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:49,960
in some particular place,
they have some territory

947
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,680
and so forth.

948
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,002
And in this other paper,
by Benjamin Kerr, what

949
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:54,960
he wanted to do was try
to understand something

950
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,400
about what the role of
that spatial structure

951
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,010
might be in maintaining
the diversity.

952
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,742
So in this case, the argument
was that, if you go out

953
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:05,450
and you look at these
lizards, the reason

954
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,199
that you see all three
of these strategies

955
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,640
is because of this
rock-paper-scissors dynamic.

956
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,510
If one of the strategies
becomes more rare,

957
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,940
it's going to have an advantage
relative to the others.

958
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,299
It's going to spread.

959
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:16,965
And what Benjamin
Kerr wanted to explore

960
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:22,300
is whether that statement
could be made-- somehow

961
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,430
you can distinguish between
whether the spatial component

962
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,760
is important or not.

963
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,416
Of course, it's hard to do that
in the case of the lizards,

964
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,790
but he was able
to implement this

965
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,780
in the case some chemical
warfare behavior in bacteria.

966
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,080
So in this paper by
Kerr, and it's also

967
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:53,790
a Nature paper from 2002.

968
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,150
So this paper is
called "Local Dispersal

969
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,890
of Promotes Biodiversity
in a Real Life

970
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,437
Game of Rock-Paper-Scissors."

971
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:02,270
So you guys read it.

972
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,025
So what were the
three strategies?

973
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:12,252

974
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

975
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,400
PROFESSOR: So C is
the colicin producers.

976
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,040

977
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,430
Incidentally, just
this colicin production

978
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,510
is kind of an incredible
phenomenon already.

979
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:34,280
So these are proteins that
are produced that bind

980
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,615
to other bacteria and can often
make pores in the membrane

981
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:38,840
and kill them.

982
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,620
But the amazing thing about
the colicin production

983
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,730
is that in E. coli
and other gram

984
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,790
negative bacteria, the only
way that these colicins are

985
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,370
released is by cell lysis.

986
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,270
So it's not just that
the cell is engaging

987
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:58,210
in some costly behavior in
order to make this protein that

988
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,200
will kill other cells.

989
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,830
But the only way that
the toxin is released

990
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,840
is by the cell
actually bursting open.

991
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,420
So it's clear then that
this has to be supported

992
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,950
by some kind of group level or
kin-selection kind of argument.

993
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,930
This can never be good
for the individual,

994
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:22,330
because the individual
has had to spill its guts

995
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,890
in order to harm other cells.

996
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,420
So the only way that
this can be supported

997
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,200
is by inhibiting the
growth of competitors

998
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,480
and allowing your
kind of kin mates

999
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,060
or other cells that also have
this plasmid, and, therefore,

1000
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,200
also the immunity protein,
allowing them to grow better.

1001
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,350
So this is a very neat
example of an altruistic,

1002
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,505
kind of warlike behavior.

1003
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:49,810

1004
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,250
So this is one of
the strategies.

1005
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,150
What was the other two.

1006
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,394

1007
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:58,350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1008
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,236
PROFESSOR: Resistant.

1009
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,610
So there's R,
which is resistant.

1010
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:06,150

1011
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,200
And between the C
and R, who wins?

1012
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,080
AUDIENCE: R.

1013
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,060
PROFESSOR: R, that's right.

1014
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,560
There might be some
costs associated

1015
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,860
with being resistant,
but the cost

1016
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,670
is not as large as
actually bursting open.

1017
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,280

1018
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,190
What's the last one?

1019
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:31,307

1020
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:32,640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sensitive.

1021
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,680
PROFESSOR: Sensitive, perfect.

1022
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,360
So this is just the
normal bacteria.

1023
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,720

1024
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,332
And the argument is
that there's often

1025
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,790
a cost to be resistant, which
means that sensitive bacteria

1026
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,630
will outcompete resistant.

1027
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:51,380
Yet, if it's just the sensitive
and the colicinogenic strains,

1028
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,305
then this strain can
beat this strain.

1029
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:57,430
So this is the idea of the
rock-paper-scissors game

1030
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,730
in this system.

1031
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,420
They do say that,
in some situations,

1032
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,710
the fitnesses are such
that it's like this.

1033
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,750
And it's good to take
these sentences seriously,

1034
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:13,150
because, if they thought that
every time that you isolate

1035
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,890
a resistant bacterium,
that it would satisfy this,

1036
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,830
they would have said, when you
do this, this is what you see.

1037
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,700
Their phrasing tells
you that actually,

1038
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,170
depending upon which strain
you get here or there,

1039
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,607
you may or may not see this.

1040
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:29,690
So you have to be careful.

1041
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:32,148
Just because there's a nice
paper that's written about this

1042
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,840
doesn't mean that, if you go out
and you find particular strains

1043
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,360
that have these properties,
that it will always

1044
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,440
yield this particular outcome.

1045
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,940

1046
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:49,840
So they argue that these
strains, just because they

1047
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,450
have a non-transitive
interaction,

1048
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,010
does not necessarily
mean that they

1049
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:59,660
will be able to coexist in
a well mixed environment

1050
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,130
in particular.

1051
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,880
And in their simulations
and the experiments,

1052
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,130
where they did experiments
in a test tube,

1053
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,480
which strain died first?

1054
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,918

1055
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:18,240
The sensitive strain.

1056
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,660
Does that make sense?

1057
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,640
Yeah, right?

1058
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,580
And the other thing to remember
is that these strains, there's

1059
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,860
no reason that they should
be accurately described

1060
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,647
by a Latka-Volterra
type formulation.

1061
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:33,480
And in particular, it
could just be the case

1062
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,980
that, if you have
enough producers

1063
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,480
and they make enough
of the colicin,

1064
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,271
then the sensitive
cells are just all dead.

1065
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:41,620

1066
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,437
And that will, in general,
be hard to capture

1067
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:47,520
in this sort of framework.

1068
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,540

1069
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,680
So the idea is that if you
start with a bunch of N's, N

1070
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,220
for each of these
three, then first you

1071
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,680
see that the
sensitive cells die.

1072
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,730
And once the sensitive
cells have died,

1073
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,100
then you're really just
playing an interaction

1074
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,240
between these two.

1075
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,040
In that case, you get the
colcinogenic strain dying,

1076
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,890
and you're left with just
the resistant strain.

1077
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:24,537

1078
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:26,120
One thing I want to
caution you about,

1079
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,980
though, is that, just
because in this experiment

1080
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,230
they saw that coexistence of
three rock-paper-scissors type

1081
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,720
strains was not possible in
a well mixed environment,

1082
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,445
it does not mean that it
will always be the case.

1083
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:42,305

1084
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:44,180
This is a very well
known paper in the field.

1085
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,500
And the thing is that it's easy
to forget what a paper shows

1086
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,810
and what it doesn't show.

1087
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,515
So what this shows is
that there is maybe

1088
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:54,890
a set of these
three strains that

1089
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,170
have a rock-paper-scissors
type interaction.

1090
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,687
And in those particular
three strains,

1091
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:01,520
that are interacting
in this particular way,

1092
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,500
via colicin killing
da-duh, then they

1093
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,655
don't coexist in this particular
well mixed and maybe other well

1094
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:07,780
mixed environments as well.

1095
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,524
But this does not
necessarily show

1096
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:11,190
that any rock-paper-scissors
interaction

1097
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:16,317
in a well mixed environment
will not support coexistence.

1098
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:18,650
And in particular, you might
remember, in Martin Nowak's

1099
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,879
book, there are very
reasonable equations

1100
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:24,170
that display rock-paper-scissors
type interactions that

1101
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,395
can lead to coexistence.

1102
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:28,020
So you can kind of
spiral in that space

1103
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,360
to a state of coexistence.

1104
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,762
So it's possible.

1105
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,470
But in this situation,
it doesn't happen.

1106
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,210

1107
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:40,592
Can somebody remind us how
they implemented the spatially

1108
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:41,550
structured environment?

1109
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:46,194

1110
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:47,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1111
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:47,776
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1112
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:49,400
So they used agar plates.

1113
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,190
They did this thing where
they took this plate,

1114
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,969
and they kind of used a
hexagonal grid of some sort.

1115
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:58,010
Is it actually hexagonal?

1116
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,194
Yeah.

1117
00:55:59,194 --> 00:56:01,360
I don't know how they decided
on the original order,

1118
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,020
but they said, OK, here
is a sensitive, sensitive,

1119
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,222
resistant,
colicinogenic, resistant.

1120
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:11,180
I don't know, whatever.

1121
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,630
So they filled it up.

1122
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,680
They put maybe 20 different
kind of patches there.

1123
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,290
And then they
basically, each day,

1124
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,200
they just used one
of these velvets,

1125
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,790
that we often use to
do replica plating.

1126
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,730
And then they just kind of
took off some of the cells

1127
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,230
and put it on a fresh plate.

1128
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:36,440
And then they did
this for a week or so.

1129
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,240
And then they saw that
there was some sense

1130
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,990
that there was a
spatial dynamic taking

1131
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,680
place, where the
spatial structure was

1132
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,520
kind of reminiscent of this.

1133
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,556
The sensitive kind of
moved into the resistant.

1134
00:56:51,556 --> 00:56:54,000
The resistant kind of moved
into the colicinogenic.

1135
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,990
Colicinogenic kind of
moved into the sensitive.

1136
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:59,630
But they couldn't
actually see all of those,

1137
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,767
because two of the strains, they
said, grew to similar density.

1138
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:06,100
That was between the sensitive
and the resistant, right?

1139
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,420
So visually, they
can only distinguish

1140
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,710
the colicinogenic strain
relative to the others.

1141
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,540
But what they found, though,
is that, over a similar amount

1142
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,330
of time, they got
coexistence of all three.

1143
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,440

1144
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,740
So R, C, S, kind
of all-- the number

1145
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,840
is just a function of time--
stuck around in this spatially

1146
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,670
structured environment.

1147
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,230
So their argument is
that, in some cases maybe,

1148
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,490
this non-transitive
interaction is not

1149
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,850
sufficient to maintain
diversity in a population,

1150
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,140
whether it's genetic diversity
or species diversity.

1151
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,490
But it may be that
it's very important

1152
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,260
to have this spatial component.

1153
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,850

1154
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,520
If you're curious
about these things,

1155
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,510
there's also a nice
computational study

1156
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:05,260
done by Erwin Frey, who studied
these rock-paper-scissors

1157
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,190
dynamics as a function
of the mobility

1158
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,290
of the individual agents.

1159
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,964
And in that study,
he found that there

1160
00:58:12,964 --> 00:58:14,630
was sort of a critical
level of mobility

1161
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:24,440
in which you kind of switch
from a spatially structured

1162
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,660
environment with coexistence
to, above some mobility,

1163
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,410
you end up losing the diversity,
because it kind of goes

1164
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,470
into this well mixed regime.

1165
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,760
So if you're curious
about these things,

1166
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,904
you can look up Erwin's paper.

1167
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:41,766

1168
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:47,890
Are there any questions
about what they did here,

1169
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,126
what you think it means?

1170
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:50,626
Yeah?

1171
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:54,070
AUDIENCE: You said you
couldn't use [INAUDIBLE].

1172
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,038
How did they know if
it was [INAUDIBLE]?

1173
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:57,740

1174
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,115
PROFESSOR: They can just scrape
off everything and plate.

1175
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:02,820

1176
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,422
AUDIENCE: And then you can tell?

1177
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:05,130
PROFESSOR: Right.

1178
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,060
Because, well, then
you can ask, oh, we're

1179
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,370
those guys sensitive
to colicin or not?

1180
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,770
AUDIENCE: Why not actually
just inject them with colicin?

1181
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,436
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1182
00:59:13,436 --> 00:59:16,930
Or plate them on
something with colicin.

1183
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:20,780
This is a system that has
been very influential,

1184
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,100
but it's really
not yet or has not

1185
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,400
been a domesticated kind of
model system in the sense

1186
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,460
that they are not nice,
fluorescent proteins.

1187
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,480
This is not on a
nice cloning plasmid.

1188
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,230
It was a natural plasmid.

1189
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:41,390
And this resistant strain,
the way that they get it is,

1190
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,060
basically, they take
some sensitive cells,

1191
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,370
and they add colicin.

1192
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,060
Let's say they supernatant
from here, and they ask,

1193
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,075
which cells grow> and then
that's a resistant cell.

1194
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:52,430
And it's genetically resistant.

1195
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,170
But then each one's
going to different.

1196
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,730
They have done sequencing.

1197
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,660
It's a surface receptor that
the colicin maybe uses to go in

1198
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,560
or other things.

1199
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,290
But indeed, we actually
did some experiments

1200
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:07,570
with some of these strains.

1201
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,675
And it's a little bit messy.

1202
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:12,710
And I think that there's a
sense that the field maybe

1203
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:17,722
needs to just make some nice
plasmids, with nice colors,

1204
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:19,430
so that we can really
distinguish things.

1205
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,020
Because I think that this
system, despite 500 citations

1206
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,410
or so, almost none
of those citations

1207
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,250
are experimental papers
really exploring this thing.

1208
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,640
Because I think that it still
is just a little bit messy.

1209
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,820
And I think that it's
also a very pretty system

1210
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,908
to explore these ideas.

1211
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:46,376

1212
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:46,876
Yeah?

1213
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:47,792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1214
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:53,367

1215
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:55,200
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, why can't you

1216
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,190
distinguish these?

1217
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,450
And they say it's because
they're similar densities.

1218
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,790
I don't even know
if that's even.

1219
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:09,650
Of course, well, if you
added sensitive cells here

1220
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,200
and sensitive cells
here and they grew up,

1221
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,790
it's likely you're not
going to see a boundary.

1222
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,780
And just more
generally, if you take

1223
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,090
similar strains-- and these
are rather similar strains,

1224
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,340
this just has some mutation
relative to this-- then

1225
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,810
you won't, often, see a boundary
when the colonies kind of grow

1226
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,732
up.

1227
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,212
AUDIENCE: So they just
didn't see boundaries.

1228
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:34,024
It's not like they didn't see--

1229
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,940
PROFESSOR: So they saw
there were cells there,

1230
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,894
but they couldn't necessarily
say that it was true

1231
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:41,310
that the sensitive
cells were kind

1232
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,615
of spreading into the resistant
cell region, because they

1233
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:44,698
couldn't see the boundary.

1234
01:01:44,698 --> 01:01:52,070

1235
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,960
So in the last 20
minutes here, 15, 20,

1236
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,240
I just want to say a few things
about these population waves.

1237
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:08,270

1238
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,380
For many, many purposes,
there are strong arguments

1239
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,620
to be made that, in the context
of evolution or ecology,

1240
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,960
spatial dynamics matter.

1241
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,030
And the way that we often think
about the spatial dynamics

1242
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,857
is via some effective
diffusive process.

1243
01:02:22,857 --> 01:02:24,440
And that's convenient,
because we know

1244
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,700
a lot about how to model it.

1245
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,280
But it's also maybe a
reasonable description

1246
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,340
of the motion of animals and
other living things over length

1247
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,590
scales that are large
compared to the movements

1248
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,700
of the animals.

1249
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,600
So what we do is we take
some equation, such as,

1250
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,260
well, we often have, say, dN/dt.

1251
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,220
So this is going to be
about population waves.

1252
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,700

1253
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,570
So we take our standard thing
where we say, oh, here's

1254
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:58,180
r N 1 minus N/K.

1255
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,830
And then we just want to
add some spatial dynamic.

1256
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,840
So what we're going to
do is we're going to say,

1257
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,506
now, the derivative,
now it's a density.

1258
01:03:03,506 --> 01:03:05,540
So we're going to use a
little n, just for fun.

1259
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,280

1260
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,120
And we might still use
a K just for simple.

1261
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,550
But then we have to add
some diffusive term.

1262
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:22,097

1263
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:24,430
So there still is going to
be a local carrying capacity.

1264
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,100
Now this is in terms of
density of the organism.

1265
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,850
And we're going to assume that
there is some diffusive type

1266
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,970
motion of the organism.

1267
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,600
Now this is this is, of course,
going over the life-scale

1268
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,750
over which the animals
are actually doing things

1269
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,880
over shorter time scales.

1270
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,390
So it could be that
different organisms

1271
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:45,040
have very different
modes of motility.

1272
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,350
In some cases they walk
or swim, in some cases

1273
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,860
they just get picked
up by a passing deer.

1274
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,940
So there are a
wide range of ways

1275
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,100
in which organisms move around.

1276
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,630
But if you look at it over kind
of longer length time scales,

1277
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,890
then maybe it doesn't matter.

1278
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:05,100
And certainly, if it's an
unbiased kind of motion,

1279
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,950
with motility
being well-behaved,

1280
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:14,400
i.e., if the probability
distribution of these steps,

1281
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,512
as long as it's not long-tailed.

1282
01:04:17,512 --> 01:04:19,470
Similarly, Oskar Hallatschek,
over at Berkeley,

1283
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,136
has been doing a lot
of fun work looking

1284
01:04:21,136 --> 01:04:23,070
at epidemic spread
in cases where

1285
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,110
this kernel, the kind of
step size distribution,

1286
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:27,710
has long tails.

1287
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,510
It leads to qualitatively
different behaviors.

1288
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,200
So if you're curious about such
things, check out Oskar's work.

1289
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,387
But for normal kind of the
step size distributions,

1290
01:04:38,387 --> 01:04:40,470
then the central limit
theorem type considerations

1291
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,920
just tell you that you
can maybe just look

1292
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,737
at it like this over time
spatial scales that are bigger.

1293
01:04:47,737 --> 01:04:48,237
Yeah?

1294
01:04:48,237 --> 01:04:51,576
AUDIENCE: But is it a unique
correlation in your step?

1295
01:04:51,576 --> 01:04:54,676
Because the central
limit theorem, as long

1296
01:04:54,676 --> 01:04:56,475
as the variance-- I
guess, you're saying?

1297
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,350
PROFESSOR: That's why
I'm saying long-tailed.

1298
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,302
AUDIENCE: If the
variance is infinite?

1299
01:05:00,302 --> 01:05:02,510
PROFESSOR: Exactly Yeah, so
that's what I was saying.

1300
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:06,130
And indeed, people argue, in
the case of disease spread,

1301
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,580
with modern air
travel and so forth,

1302
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,290
that the probability
distribution

1303
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,440
of kind of step sizes
for infected individuals,

1304
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,950
over the next week,
is long-tailed, right?

1305
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:19,130
Because there's a fair
chance that you're just

1306
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,730
going to stay around
your local neighborhood,

1307
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:21,890
but there's a
smaller chance you're

1308
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,473
going to go to the
other side of town.

1309
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:27,540
But you might go to a
business trip over in DC.

1310
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,780
At some small right, though,
you also fly to South Africa

1311
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,010
and go to a conference.

1312
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:36,090
So all of these things have
reasonable probabilities,

1313
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:39,240
and so there are arguments that
this is kind of some power law

1314
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,200
type distribution.

1315
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,540
And in those cases,
you don't necessarily

1316
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,612
have finite variance, and
so then you can't just

1317
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:47,820
put everything under the rug.

1318
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,237

1319
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:53,320
But we first want to
understand what happens here,

1320
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,810
and then we can--
well, we're not

1321
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,310
going to-- but then
other people can

1322
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,768
think more deeply about what
happens in fancier situations.

1323
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:02,830

1324
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,960
It is worth saying,
though, that this approach,

1325
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,420
I mean it looks very
physics-y, in the sense that

1326
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:13,020
physicists like simple
equations where we add diffusion

1327
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:13,610
and so forth.

1328
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:17,872
But this is not what a
physicist came up with.

1329
01:06:17,872 --> 01:06:21,980
These are classic ideas
in evolution and ecology.

1330
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,780
The solution to this was
originally done by Fisher.

1331
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,920
So this was in the 1920s or so.

1332
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,560
So a long time ago,
originally to try

1333
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,440
to understand not the
spread of a population

1334
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,260
but the spread of a beneficial
allele in a spatial population.

1335
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,290
And once again, this
highlights the deep connections

1336
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,090
between evolution and ecology.

1337
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,840
You can have a
genetic wave in space

1338
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,460
of a of a beneficial
mutant spreading,

1339
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,446
or you can have a population
wave of an invasive species

1340
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:52,821
or whatnot, and you end up
getting very similar dynamics.

1341
01:06:52,821 --> 01:07:00,596

1342
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:01,970
So the basic idea,
here, is that,

1343
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:10,730
if you look at the density
as a function of position.

1344
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:14,180
If start with, there's
one individual.

1345
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,671
What's going to happen?

1346
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:19,150

1347
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:22,450
It's going to start
dividing, right?

1348
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,337
So we kind of get up.

1349
01:07:24,337 --> 01:07:25,420
And it's going to come up.

1350
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,590
And eventually it's
going to saturate

1351
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:32,900
at this carrying capacity, K.

1352
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,360
And then you end up getting
these spreading population

1353
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,467
waves that look like this.

1354
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:40,050
And the reason we're
calling it a wave

1355
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:44,000
is because the shape of this
front is the same over time.

1356
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,330

1357
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:59,450
So it can really to be described
as some function x minus vt.

1358
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,840
And we are going to,
maybe, typically assume

1359
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,910
that we're in a situation
where we don't have

1360
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:04,810
to think about the
left and the right,

1361
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,510
because it's just
too complicated.

1362
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:09,070
So we'll just imagine it being
that it's at saturation here,

1363
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,861
and then we're looking
at some front that's

1364
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:12,860
moving to the right.

1365
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:17,988
Now, by dimensional
analysis, we should

1366
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:20,279
be able to figure out what
the velocity is going to be.

1367
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,707

1368
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:24,665
Remember how much we
liked dimensional analysis

1369
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:27,600
in this class?

1370
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,060
Yes.

1371
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,910
So what we're
going to do is I'll

1372
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:33,950
give you some
characters that you're

1373
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,765
going to be able to
use in your quest.

1374
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:40,109

1375
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:48,069
So we can use r, K, D. I'll give
you a square root in case you

1376
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:50,950
find it useful.

1377
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:59,600
And you can raise something
to the second power as well.

1378
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,080
So what you can do is you're
going to set up your cards

1379
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,330
so that when I look at it,
from the left to the right,

1380
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,380
it will describe the
velocity of this wave.

1381
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,988

1382
01:09:12,988 --> 01:09:14,029
I'll give you 30 seconds.

1383
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:17,069

1384
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:24,049
So this is dimensional analysis
for this wave velocity.

1385
01:09:24,049 --> 01:10:06,890

1386
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:08,310
All right, do you
need more time?

1387
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:08,810
Yes?

1388
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:10,000
OK, that's fine.

1389
01:10:10,000 --> 01:11:06,650

1390
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:08,800
All right, let's
go ahead and vote.

1391
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,310

1392
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,730
Construct your answer, remember,
from me, from left to right.

1393
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,530

1394
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,950
Ready, three, two, one.

1395
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:27,160

1396
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,170
All right.

1397
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,700
We have trouble.

1398
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,850
A key skill is being
able to imagine yourself

1399
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,680
in someone else's shoes.

1400
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,800
So if I'm viewing--
but that's OK.

1401
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,630

1402
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:47,250
So we have, here, this is
kind of units of 1 over time.

1403
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:51,850
This is what length
squared over time.

1404
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,515
Whereas this is a density.

1405
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:57,090

1406
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:01,190
If we want something that
is a length over time,

1407
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:04,190
then we're going to end up
having to take r times D

1408
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,230
and take a square root.

1409
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:14,230
So this should be DAC,
which is a square root

1410
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,689
of-- of course, it depends
on how you're entering it

1411
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:18,980
into your calculator, if you
have scientific calculator

1412
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,920
or something else, maybe.

1413
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,290
And indeed, it ends
up, there's a 2 here.

1414
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,100
So this is the velocity.

1415
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:31,080

1416
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:31,658
Yes?

1417
01:12:31,658 --> 01:12:32,574
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1418
01:12:32,574 --> 01:12:47,970

1419
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,470
PROFESSOR: I see
what you're saying.

1420
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,840
But it ends up not being true.

1421
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,030
These derivative signs
don't have any units.

1422
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:00,210
So this still has
units of a density

1423
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,150
divided by a length squared.

1424
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:06,096
So for unit purposes, you just
look at this thing and at this.

1425
01:13:06,096 --> 01:13:09,155
This squared does mean
there's a length squared

1426
01:13:09,155 --> 01:13:11,530
in the denominator, but this
squared doesn't do anything.

1427
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:15,140

1428
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,210
So D is still a length
squared over time.

1429
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:20,140

1430
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,380
So this is the famous
Fisher velocity.

1431
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,590

1432
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,185
There are some
mathematical subtleties

1433
01:13:27,185 --> 01:13:29,705
to all of this that we're
not really going to get into.

1434
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,630
I don't know.

1435
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,880
I'm having trouble-- velocity.

1436
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,540

1437
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,350
There are a few
features to highlight.

1438
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:42,497
If the organism grows
faster, the wave

1439
01:13:42,497 --> 01:13:43,580
is going to spread faster.

1440
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,860
That make sense?

1441
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,660
If it has a larger mobility,
it also moves faster.

1442
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,000
That makes sense.

1443
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,260
Of course, the velocity is
given by both of those things.

1444
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:59,440
So this wave coming out really
is a population level property.

1445
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,130
Because it's not just growth.

1446
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:03,430
It's not just motion.

1447
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:08,406
It's a result of the coupled
division and diffusion

1448
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:10,280
that leads to this
population wave spreading.

1449
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,330

1450
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,440
Importantly, to first
order, it doesn't

1451
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,030
depend on the carrying
capacity, at least

1452
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,470
within the deterministic regime.

1453
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:27,350

1454
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:31,957
AUDIENCE: It's interesting that,
if the reproductive rate goes

1455
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:35,110
to 0, suddenly the
population stops spreading.

1456
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:39,226

1457
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:40,350
PROFESSOR: So first of all.

1458
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,890
You'd say, oh, it would be
sort of surprising if it really

1459
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,910
kept on spreading in
the absence of growth.

1460
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,470
But what you're
pointing out is that,

1461
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:49,232
if you just, at one
moment, turn off division,

1462
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:50,690
then there will
still be diffusion.

1463
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,330
It'll still keep on going.

1464
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:55,820
But this is the velocity
of a wave when it's a wave.

1465
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:00,630
When it's described by
a function like this.

1466
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:03,400
So it's true that you
could turn off division,

1467
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,456
and it'll still diffuse.

1468
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,080
But then the shape
is changing as well.

1469
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:12,840

1470
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:18,450
I'm going to draw a
few lines describing

1471
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:22,310
possible populations.

1472
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:27,850
Now, let's assume that they
have the same motion, diffusion.

1473
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,650
I want to know, which one
has the largest velocity?

1474
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:44,530

1475
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:51,110
Is it A, B, C, D?

1476
01:15:51,110 --> 01:16:09,030

1477
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,030
It's the same diffusion.

1478
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:17,040

1479
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,700
Per capita growth rate as
a function of the density

1480
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,810
for three different organisms.

1481
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:44,470

1482
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:47,865
Ready, three, two, one.

1483
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:50,820

1484
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,870
All right, so I'd say we have
a fair number of B's, D's.

1485
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:57,080

1486
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:03,670
It seems like it's B versus D.
Now, this is tricky because D,

1487
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:07,950
we have not explicitly
considered here.

1488
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:12,232
But it turns out that the
answer is B. Certainly,

1489
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:13,940
between these three,
these are all really

1490
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,500
logistic growth functions.

1491
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,140
And so from the standpoint
of here, it's just this r.

1492
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:25,017
And r is the division
rate at 0 cell density.

1493
01:17:25,017 --> 01:17:26,850
The per capita growth
rate at 0 cell density

1494
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:30,050
is what determines the
velocity in a Fisher wave.

1495
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,400
And indeed, that's
true even if there's

1496
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,583
no decrease in the
growth up right until you

1497
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,480
get to some carrying capacity.

1498
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,944
And indeed, all of these
cases, the division rate

1499
01:17:41,944 --> 01:17:44,110
and the growth rate that's
relevant for the velocity

1500
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:49,445
is when it hits this axis.

1501
01:17:49,445 --> 01:17:53,100
And indeed, all of these
waves are described as Fisher

1502
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,000
or pulled waves.

1503
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,630

1504
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,810
Because there's a sense
that the entire wave

1505
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,480
is determined by the
front of the wave.

1506
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,240
So we drew this profile.

1507
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,522
I didn't do that very well.

1508
01:18:06,522 --> 01:18:07,730
Here, this is an exponential.

1509
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:11,540

1510
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,029
And the exponential actually
is what's pulling this wave.

1511
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:17,820
There ends up being a
characteristic length

1512
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:23,160
scale here that is the
square root of D/r.

1513
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,230
So this is the length
scale of the exponential.

1514
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:30,000
And the velocity
and the length scale

1515
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,630
are only functions
of the division

1516
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:36,770
rate in the limit
below cell density

1517
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,040
or low density of organism.

1518
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,860

1519
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:46,187
The shape of what goes
on here changes, indeed,

1520
01:18:46,187 --> 01:18:48,020
the bulk properties of
the wave, but doesn't

1521
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,910
change the velocity.

1522
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,370
And I just want to make
one comparison of all this

1523
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:59,020
to-- because there's another
qualitatively different kind

1524
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:02,660
of wave, which is a
so-called pushed wave.

1525
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:07,680

1526
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,760
And that's what happens
if you have an Allee

1527
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,060
effect, particularly like
a strong Allee effect.

1528
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:18,610
If this thing looks-- like
this is certainly possible.

1529
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:21,840

1530
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,230
This is an Allee effect.

1531
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,939
Now, if you just said, oh,
the only thing that matters is

1532
01:19:27,939 --> 01:19:30,230
the growth rate at low cell
density, you would say, oh,

1533
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:32,300
this thing cannot
possibly expand.

1534
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,130
Although it turns out
that it still is possible.

1535
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,770
And in this
situation, it would be

1536
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,200
called a push wave, where
your profile somehow

1537
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,500
maybe looks kind of similar.

1538
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,910
But instead of it
being the front

1539
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,920
of the wave that's
pulling the wave,

1540
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,890
it's diffusion around the bulk.

1541
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,430
Because the bulk
is the part that

1542
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,840
is actually happily growing.

1543
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,350
Because the front, here,
in this case, is dying.

1544
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:59,610
Yet it still is possible to
have a positive velocity.

1545
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:03,330
And so this is, then, a
qualitatively different kind

1546
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:05,681
of population expansion.

1547
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,180
So cooperatively
growing populations

1548
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:10,280
expand very differently
from logistically growing

1549
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,200
populations.

1550
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,200
And one of things that the
reading in Physics Today

1551
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,000
talked about is
these different rates

1552
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,340
of loss of heterozygocity and so
forth in different populations.

1553
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,990
And as you might
expect, the pulled waves

1554
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:26,570
have a smaller effective
population size

1555
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:31,137
than the pushed waves, because,
here, the relevant population

1556
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:32,720
is at the front if
it's a low density.

1557
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,261
Whereas here, the
relevant population

1558
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:37,144
is the bulk that's
at high density.

1559
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:38,560
With that, I think
we should quit.

1560
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,955
But I will see you on Tuesday.

1561
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:42,500
And we'll talk about this
neutral theory in ecology.

1562
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,050
Thanks.

1563
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,445
