00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:21,312

10
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,270
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and get going.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,420
Today what we want
to do is talk about

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,650
predator/prey interactions.

13
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,393
In particular, how a predator
and its associated prey

14
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:32,860
can in principal
oscillate over time.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,700
Now in this area there's this
very important model block,

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,311
a Volterra model,
that has been used

17
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,560
as kind of the standard model.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,851
It's given us some intuition
for how this might happen.

19
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,830
But mathematical
biologists really

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,165
don't like this model very
much, because the oscillations

21
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:54,010
that it give are neutral,
or neutrally stable

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,440
cycles or orbits.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
What I mean is that
it's not a limit cycle.

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,390
It doesn't have a characteristic
amplitude, nor a period.

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,170

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,420
And associated with that--
and it's not a concidence--

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,430
and associated with
it, what it means

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,060
is that if you make sort
of very small modifications

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,640
to the model, then you can
get qualitatively different

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,140
outcomes.

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,470
In particular, you can either
abolish the cycles-- i.e.,

32
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,130
you can turn these
neutrally stable orbits

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,190
into stable limits--
or I'm sorry.

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,120
Into a stable spiral.

35
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,824
So it may have damped
the oscillations.

36
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,990
So it could be that the
oscillations kind of go away

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,730
over time.

38
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,680
Or it could be that you turn
them into true limit cycle

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,530
oscillations.

40
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,290
And this could just be from
very small changes in the model.

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,900
That's associated with this
fact that the logical Volterra

42
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,217
model was neutrally stable.

43
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,050
Then we'll kind of
switch gears a little bit

44
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,080
and talk about
these experiments--

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,350
that Yoshida paper that you
guys read-- where they looked

46
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,310
at this question of what
happens in kind of a laboratory

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,450
experiment where you have
a predator and its prey.

48
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,920
And in particular
what they found

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,050
is that if there is evolution
in the prey population,

50
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,710
that you can get qualitatively
different oscillations

51
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,530
in particular.

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,946
Instead of having a 90 degree
phase shift between predator

53
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,690
and prey, you can end
up with 180 degrees

54
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,830
phase shift, so kind of
anti-correlated oscillations.

55
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,400
But also that the oscillations
could be much longer than what

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,899
you'd.

57
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,240
Expect

58
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
And finally we'll
say something about

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,640
these noise-induced
oscillations, which

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
I believe that
you guys have been

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,540
playing with a bit in the
context of your homework.

62
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,670
Is it the next one?

63
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,870
Oh, I get it.

64
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,650
Well, you will get a chance
to play with a great deal.

65
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,240
So pay attention then.

66
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,110
All right.

67
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,290
Any questions
before we get going?

68
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,180
Problem set's due tomorrow so
that you can enjoy Thanksgiving

69
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,780
with your family or friends.

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,506
And then we'll have
one more problem set.

71
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:54,950

72
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,480
So this Lotka-Volterra model.

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,350

74
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,330
There's kind of a
fun history of this,

75
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,570
which I'll tell you about.

76
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,857
But I just want to
highlight that there

77
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,190
are two important things that
you should be remembering.

78
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,680
And I'm getting these two
points from Mark Kot in his book

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Elements of Theoretical
Ecology, where

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,150
he says there are two things you
need to know about this model.

81
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,290
One is that it's a bad model.

82
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,890
And of course you can
argue what you mean by bad.

83
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,420
I think it's maybe
overstating it.

84
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,790
But we'll try to be explicit
about why he might say that.

85
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,500
But then it's sort of
profoundly important.

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,790

87
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,260
He kind of says from a
historical perspective.

88
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,840
But I would say that maybe
both of these statements

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,720
are sort of true.

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,810
It's a bad model
mathematically in some ways,

91
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,570
because it's somehow
structurally unstable, but also

92
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,450
profoundly important.

93
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,150

94
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,800
The mark of
intelligence is being

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,810
able to keep two incompatible
ideas in your mind

96
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,230
at the same time.

97
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,120
Somebody said
something like that.

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,780
More than two?

99
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,166
OK.

100
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,290
Well, we'll try to figure
out what we mean by this.

101
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,750
All right.

102
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,640
So Kot, it's a nice book
on mathematical ecology,

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,530
if you're curious.

104
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:23,180
The history of this is that
it was in the mid-1920s.

105
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,860
And there was a marine biologist
named Humberto D'Ancona.

106
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,550
Does anybody speak Italian?

107
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,060

108
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,550
Well, he was a marine biologist.

109
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,190
And he had been studying the
prevalence of different fish

110
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,080
species in fish markets, and
kind of throughout Italy.

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,250
So he went to fish markets.

112
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,600
Over the course of about
R-K. For about 10 years.

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Right?

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,300
So kind of roughly
from 1912 to 1923.

115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,140
Something like that.

116
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,010
And he basically
asked, well, what

117
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,720
is the kind of the
composition of fish

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,870
being sold in all these
fish markets across Italy.

119
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,700
And he noticed something
that was very interesting,

120
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,060
which is that there was a
marked change in the composition

121
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,910
between more predatory
fish as compared

122
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,650
to more prey-like fish.

123
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,025
And this was associated with
something that was happening

124
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,360
in Europe around that time.

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,710

126
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,130
World War I. OK.

127
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,610
So World War I in the middle.

128
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,640

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
And what he found was that
in the middle of this period

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,330
there was an increase,
and then later a decrease

131
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:50,601
of what he called selachians,
which is apparently

132
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,510
a word for sharks
and shark-like fish.

133
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,354

134
00:05:57,354 --> 00:06:01,675
But for our purposes, we'll
just say they are typically

135
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:02,425
kind of predators.

136
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,020

137
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,500
So what he saw is that
this number of selachians,

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,340
a function of time, kind
of went like this, right.

139
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,960
Where this was kind of
roughly World War I.

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,970
And he wanted to try to
understand why did this happen.

141
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,290
Why is it that war
favors predators?

142
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:36,590

143
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,700
Probably not just having to
do with the general zeitgeist

144
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,390
at the time.So it's probably a
more mechanistic explanation.

145
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,820
And luckily, Humberto was
engaged to the beautiful Luisa

146
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,320
Volterra.

147
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,819
OK.

148
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,240

149
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,780
Oops.

150
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,240
Engaged to Luisa Volterra.

151
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,490
So one day mid-1920s,
our hero Humberto

152
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,110
was visiting his girlfriend.

153
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,720
And he started chatting with
his future father-in-law, who

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,240
was Vito Volterra, and
asked him this question.

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,110
And luckily, Vito Volterra
was a famous mathematician.

156
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,770
So he could write
down a fancy model

157
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,728
and try to get some
insight into this question.

158
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:34,050

159
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,620
So this is a case of random
personal interaction leading

160
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,840
to something interesting.

161
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,950
That's the Volterra--
Lotka had actually

162
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,360
studied these equations
almost 15 years earlier.

163
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,810
First in the context of auto
catalytic kind of chemical

164
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,900
reactions and so forth.

165
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,800
But then later indeed, in the
context of population dynamics.

166
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,220
So Lotka wrote a book
in the mid-1920s.

167
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,297
Volterra wrote an article
analyzing D'Ancona's data.

168
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,380
And then now it's called
the Lotka-Volterra model.

169
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,740

170
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,300
And we'll come
back to this thing

171
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,770
about why is it that war
favors predators after we

172
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,580
get a sense of the model.

173
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,700

174
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,650
So what Volterra wrote
down was the following.

175
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:38,080

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,590
First of all, we should all
make sure we can figure out

177
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,710
which one is the predator
and which one is the prey.

178
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,170
So let's think about
this for 15 seconds.

179
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,110
And then we're going to
yell it out verbally.

180
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:58,400

181
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,640
Is y the predator or the prey?

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,899
Ready, three, two, one.

183
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:03,690
AUDIENCE: Predator.

184
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,523
PROFESSOR: Predator.

185
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,220
All right.

186
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,610
So we have a predator
here and prey.

187
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,910

188
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,960
Is the total size
of the population

189
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,790
constant? i.e, is x plus
y equal to a constant?

190
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,340
Ready, yes or no.

191
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,840
Verbally.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,780
Three, two, one.

193
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,260
No.

194
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,520
It would be a constant
perhaps if these two terms--

195
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,711
if b were equal to d or so.

196
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,210
No.

197
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,150
That's not even true.

198
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,930
Never mind.

199
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,430
Yeah.

200
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:40,929
OK.

201
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,810
I guess really what
I'm thinking about is

202
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,680
this tells us about
how many predators can

203
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,670
be created from a prey.

204
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,700
But then there's also
the growth in death rate.

205
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,920
All right.

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,010
But even this act
of converting prey

207
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,087
into a predator,
even on that level

208
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,170
it's not conserved, right?

209
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,980
And of course, vegetarians
like to point out

210
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:09,420
that you can create many corn
burgers for the price of making

211
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,487
a hamburger.

212
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:11,320
Something like that.

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,820
OK.

214
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,420

215
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,780
Except in the case of salmon.

216
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,730
This is not true.

217
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,240

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,380
Well, all right.

219
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,000
We can analyze the
ratio of d over b

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,250
for a variety of
different newt sandwiches

221
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,410
after class, perhaps.

222
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,080

223
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,780
OK.

224
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,110
So this is pretty much
the simplest model

225
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,840
you can kind of
possibly write down

226
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,140
that captures this basic
idea that when these two

227
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,080
species interact, we're assuming
that there's this mass action

228
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,290
kind of rate.

229
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,360
That it's just
proportional to the number

230
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,701
of the density of x and y.

231
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:50,950
Now I think that in the
context of chemical reactions,

232
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,780
this is going to be true over
a huge range of densities,

233
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,700
and perhaps almost
even rigorously true

234
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,590
if they are just single.

235
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,430
There's just some x and y
that bounce into each other.

236
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,140
And at some rate
they do something.

237
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,210
Whereas I think in the
context of predator and prey,

238
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,670
this is on much
less firm footing.

239
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,510
That's OK.

240
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,870
So it's at least the simplest
thing we can write down.

241
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,810
And of course, then we'll
have to ask, how is it

242
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,185
that the conclusions
of the model

243
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:22,210
might vary depending on the
assumptions that go in here.

244
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,050
One thing that we've spent a
lot of time in this class doing

245
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,670
is trying to look at a set
of equations, and in words,

246
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,910
be able to extract what the
assumptions were that went

247
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,030
into writing the equation.

248
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,690
And associated
with that, you can

249
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,660
think about all these things
about the nondimensionalized

250
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,080
versions of these equations.

251
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,610
You'll often see the
predator/prey models written

252
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,980
in some nondimensionalized
version, where for example, you

253
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,230
get rid of maybe the
a and maybe the c.

254
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,760
I think that in
many cases I prefer

255
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,730
to just leave these terms in
here, because that way we can

256
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,639
immediately see what
happens if we go hunting,

257
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,680
or if we do this or that.

258
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,370

259
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,110
OK.

260
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,550
Can we try to figure
out what-- there

261
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,250
are four assumptions,
at least, that

262
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,180
have gone into this that are
relevant and are worth saying.

263
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,570
Can you guys help me out?

264
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:31,367

265
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:31,867
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:32,950
AUDIENCE: It's well-mixed.

267
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,387
The interaction in
terms of [INAUDIBLE].

268
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:35,970
PROFESSOR: OK.

269
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,469
Right.

270
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,490
So it's well-mixed.

271
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,730
And there's two aspects that
we might-- So one thing,

272
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,310
it is certainly worth
saying that it's well-mixed.

273
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,360
But associated with
that, you're going to say

274
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
that it's because of x times y.

275
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,120
Right?

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,620
Yeah.

277
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,470
I guess that's what I feel
you were about to say.

278
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,919

279
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,340
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess.

280
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

281
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,460
Right I guess.

282
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,668
But I think we have to keep
these things a little bit

283
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:05,730
separate in the
context of chemistry,

284
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,620
those are maybe the
same statements, right?

285
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,324
Of course, we're
writing these things.

286
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,740
These are just quantities that
are just functions of time.

287
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,670
We have not included
space explicitly.

288
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,110
So in that sense, it's
definitely a well-mixed model.

289
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,720
But just because we're
assuming that it's well-mixed,

290
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,834
we're not keeping track
of the state of density

291
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,250
as a function of
position does not

292
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,290
mean that they have to
interact with this term.

293
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,920
And for two molecules that are
bouncing against each other,

294
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,860
then I think that is the case.

295
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,681
But we have to keep these
assumptions separate.

296
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,722
AUDIENCE: You could imagine
a colony of bacteria,

297
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:43,060
for example, where
they're all-- you can only

298
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,530
prey on the outside.

299
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

300
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,680
Necessary.

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,702
I guess what I would say is
that if it were not well-mixed,

302
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,660
it could still be that
they interact like this.

303
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,200
And you just keep track of
the predator/prey density

304
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,620
as a function of position.

305
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,270
And they could still interact
in this way, possibly.

306
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,210

307
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,370
And in particular, in the
context of Turing patterns,

308
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,880
what we did is we
allowed these things

309
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,574
to vary as a
function of position.

310
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:14,490
But then we would have
still typically written

311
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,330
the interaction
term as x times y.

312
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,186
So it is true
we're modeling this

313
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:22,310
as a well-mixed population.

314
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,215
But I think that's
independent of this statement.

315
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:29,030

316
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,770
Do you agree or disagree?

317
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,660
Or?

318
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,100
AUDIENCE: But if
it's well-mixed,

319
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,340
the encounter frequency will
be proportional to [INAUDIBLE].

320
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,194
AUDIENCE: That's sort
of the secret, right?

321
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:43,860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

322
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,644
AUDIENCE: The assumption
is the encounter frequency

323
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:49,124
is proportionate, right?

324
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:49,790
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

325
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,290
OK.

326
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,020
So what I would say
is-- well, certainly

327
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,070
in the context of
predators and prey,

328
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,940
it could be that if
the prey is full,

329
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,650
then it's not going
to be so simple.

330
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,000
In a sense, is that I
guess it could be more

331
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,850
complicated than that is all.

332
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,689
But my statement--

333
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,022
AUDIENCE: So you're saying--
I'm sorry-- the interaction

334
00:15:14,022 --> 00:15:18,330
term would not necessarily be
just a function of x times y.

335
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

336
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,370
It could be more
complicated than that.

337
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,030
And the other thing is that
even if it were not well-mixed,

338
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,127
in the context of these
reaction diffusion models,

339
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,710
we would typically say that the
rate that these two things hit

340
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,710
each other is x times y.

341
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,360
But they're each a
function of position.

342
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,520
Right.

343
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,680
So it's not that there's--
it can either be well-mixed

344
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,130
or not.

345
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,505
And it can either
be this or not.

346
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,167
I guess.

347
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,125
AUDIENCE: But it's not
quite the same variable,

348
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,100
because in that case it would
be the density, whereas--

349
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,220
PROFESSOR: I agree.

350
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,850
Although here, it's not
obvious whether we're

351
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,220
talking about number
or density, frankly.

352
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,800
Right.

353
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,040
And we often talk about this as
if it's the number of predator,

354
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,780
number of prey.

355
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,350
But then that's a little bit
inconsistent with this in that

356
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,840
if you were-- this
should really be,

357
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,310
if you're thinking about
these terms being the product.

358
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,300
And it should really
be the density.

359
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,020
And if you're looking
at the population

360
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,547
size in some fixed area or
volume, then it doesn't matter.

361
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,380
But even in the context
of predator or prey,

362
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,160
I'd say that the way in
which this would make senses

363
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,976
is via densities.

364
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:24,910

365
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,560
Does this discussion make sense?

366
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,540
Maybe?

367
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,320
We are assuming it's
well-mixed, because we're not

368
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,410
thinking about these things
as a function of position.

369
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,590
But I would say that we
cannot get that from just

370
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,256
the interaction term.

371
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:42,922
We are assuming it's
well-mixed, though.

372
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:47,059

373
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,600
Other things that
we've assumed here?

374
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,224

375
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,182
AUDIENCE: Something along
the lines of the prey

376
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,110
doesn't need the
predator, for instance.

377
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,818
PROFESSOR: Right.

378
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,119
The prey does not
need the predator.

379
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,910
And in particular, what
happens to the prey

380
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,140
in the absence of predator?

381
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,819
AUDIENCE: It grows.

382
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,660
PROFESSOR: So the prey
grows exponentially.

383
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,493
AUDIENCE: Because it's
not diet [INAUDIBLE].

384
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:19,880

385
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,282
PROFESSOR: Without predator.

386
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,990
And the other thing
that is perhaps worth

387
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,450
mentioning in all this
though is that this

388
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,880
is a deterministic
description of the world.

389
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,990
So a here is telling us about--
the normal way that we would

390
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,570
interpret a is it's the rate
of division of the cells,

391
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:43,350
or the rate of new deer
being born, or whatnot.

392
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,830
But of course, a
could actually be

393
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,074
the difference between this
growth rate and a death rate.

394
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:50,240
So just because we don't
have an explicit death rate

395
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,410
doesn't mean that
there's no death.

396
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,369
So I think you can't actually
say that the prey does not

397
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,660
die in the absence of predator.

398
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,920
What you can say is that
the prey population--

399
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,700
we're assuming that
a is greater than 0.

400
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,912

401
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:12,120
So what you can say is that
the prey population grows

402
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,390
exponentially without
the predator at rate a.

403
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,590
But this is really in
principle the difference

404
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,940
between the growth rate and
the death rate of the prey

405
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,590
in the absence of the predator.

406
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,710
And in the context of a
differential equation,

407
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,330
this doesn't make
any difference.

408
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,157
But if we were to go and do a
master equation type formalism,

409
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,365
would this make a difference?

410
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,961

411
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:33,460
Yeah.

412
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,960
Right.

413
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,615
So this is the whole thing about
the Fokker-Planck approach.

414
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:41,880
And you can get different
variances at equilibrium,

415
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
depending on whether the rate
of forward back reactions and so

416
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,430
forth.

417
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,983
Does that sound
familiar to you guys?

418
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:49,482
No.

419
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:54,874

420
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:56,540
What else have we
assumed in this model?

421
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,380

422
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,316
AUDIENCE: The predator
dies exponentially.

423
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,024
PROFESSOR: Right.

424
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:07,610
So the predator dies
exponentially when?

425
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,925
So the predator dies
exponentially without the prey.

426
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:26,100

427
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,485
So it's a nice
simple assumption.

428
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,860
Other things that you might
like to point out about this?

429
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,668

430
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:36,547
AUDIENCE: A single
predator is [INAUDIBLE].

431
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,130
PROFESSOR: OK.

432
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,629
Right.

433
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,060
So there is a sense that
it's just x times y.

434
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,910
So the most simple way
to think about this

435
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,820
is that it somehow is a single
predator eating a single prey.

436
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,300
There's maybe no group
hunting type behavior.

437
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,530
So if we wanted to try to
understand how a pack of wolves

438
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,290
can bring down a
buffalo, then you

439
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,700
might not want to
use this equation.

440
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,870
So this is that the
rate of predation

441
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:12,930
is proportional-- we'll
say goes as x times y.

442
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:18,720
And that embodies many
different kinds of assumptions.

443
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:29,371

444
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,370
These are four findings.

445
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:41,860

446
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,560
OK.

447
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,440
So since it's such a simple
model, we can go ahead

448
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,630
and we can just solve it.

449
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,130
Right.

450
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,670

451
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,790
How many fixed points
are there going to be?

452
00:20:51,790 --> 00:21:06,120

453
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,620
Two.

454
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,100
OK.

455
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,880
It's always good to
remember these things.

456
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,156
And so what we can
think about, this as x.

457
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:16,050
This is y.

458
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,610
There's indeed going to be a
fixed point somewhere in here.

459
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,860
But then the other one is
going to be at zero, zero.

460
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,022
Because the top equation
has x's everywhere.

461
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:25,480
Bottom equation
has y's everywhere.

462
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,960
So indeed, there's going to be
one fixed point at zero,zero.

463
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,620

464
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,770
So-called the
trivial fixed point.

465
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,610

466
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,760
Is this a stable, or is this
an unstable fixed point?

467
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,260
Let's think about
this for a moment.

468
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,270
And then we'll vote verbally.

469
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,160
Stable or unstable?

470
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,660
OK.

471
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,560
Ready, three, two, one.

472
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

473
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,220
PROFESSOR: So I think there
were some disagreements there

474
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,620
probably.

475
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,040
It was a little hard to
tell from the verbal.

476
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,670
And one way that we can
think about this as that we

477
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,150
can ask, well, the predator in
the absence of the prey, what

478
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,110
happens to it?

479
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,290
So it kind of comes down here.

480
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,550
So along this axis it's stable.

481
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,060
However, in the
absence of predator,

482
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,460
if you think about the
prey, that'll grow.

483
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,360

484
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,620
So this is actually an
unstable fixed point.

485
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,471
Stable along one axis and
unstable on the other.

486
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:34,970
Incidentally, what
does this tell us

487
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:41,379
about the eigenvectors
around this fixed point?

488
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:42,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

489
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

490
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,275
The eigenvectors are
really just 0, 1, 1, 0.

491
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,650
Because you can see that if
you start along one of these,

492
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,360
you come straight down.

493
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,443
Start along the other one,
you come straight down.

494
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:56,320

495
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,930
And the other one we
can just see by-- well,

496
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,160
we can solve it directly.

497
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,630
Just we pull out an x.

498
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,000
It's when a minus
by is equal to zero.

499
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,610
And also when minus c
plus dx is equal to zero.

500
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,790
So the other fixed point,
this x star, y star, and this

501
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,720
is maybe the important one.

502
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,960
It's going to be just
c over d and a over b.

503
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,130

504
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,410
Super simple model.

505
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,000
Right?

506
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,340
You can calculate
where the fixed

507
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,630
points are kind of immediately.

508
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,670
But it's actually a model that
has many weird properties.

509
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,640
Some of which you might
think of as features.

510
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,660
Some of which you
might think of as bugs.

511
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,800
But in particular, the location
of this fixed point, I think,

512
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,720
is really sort of surprising
in that its dependence on this

513
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,010
abcd.

514
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,100
This is part of
why I really think

515
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,790
that when analyzing this
model, I very much prefer

516
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,450
to keep the a's, b's, c's,
d's, rather than using

517
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,200
the nondimensionalized
version of it.

518
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,160
Because when you do that, you
lose track of what's going on.

519
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,230
So this model for example,
makes very clear predictions

520
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,180
of what should happen if
you hunt the predator.

521
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:38,910

522
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,920
There are various contexts
in which wildlife managers

523
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,260
have been interested in trying
to help a prey population.

524
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,660
So if a prey population
is suffering in some way,

525
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,810
then you can reasonably think
what you should want to do

526
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,940
is kill the predator.

527
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,850
And this is all these debates
where you have the wildlife

528
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,480
managers, where they buy
automatic rifles in order

529
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,010
to shoot wolves
from helicopters.

530
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,970
We have a Canadian
in the room, right?

531
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,454
I mean, wasn't this
a Canadian proposal?

532
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:18,620
AUDIENCE: I'm very American.

533
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,785
PROFESSOR: All right.

534
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:24,020
We'll have to do some more
research to figure out exactly.

535
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,520
OK.

536
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,810
Right.

537
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,680
So the question is, well, what
happens at least in this model?

538
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,020
And people apparently
have seen this sort

539
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,650
of thing occurring in natural
populations as well, right?

540
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:41,870
If you hunt the predator by
going out and shooting them,

541
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,580
what does this do to the
predator and the prey

542
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,440
populations.

543
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:56,130
In particular, we think
about x star, y star.

544
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:30,800

545
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,345
Well maybe this-- am I confused?

546
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:40,950

547
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,590
Maybe this is the example
that I'm confused by.

548
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,270
Well we have to complete
it now that I started it.

549
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,390
But now I might
have gone backwards.

550
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,380

551
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,660
We'll see what happens,
and then discuss.

552
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,160
All right.

553
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,100
Ready.

554
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,564
Three-- Oh wait.

555
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:58,730
I don't have enough options.

556
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,320
OK.

557
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,820
Sorry.

558
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,440
We should do one,
then the other.

559
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,690
Because sometimes things
don't change, right?

560
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,535
So how do I do this?

561
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:09,320
OK.

562
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,820
Sorry.

563
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,320
OK.

564
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,380
We should just do one,
then the other, right?

565
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:20,300

566
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,070
No change.

567
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,810
This is down.

568
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,310
OK.

569
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,995

570
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:29,620
There's gonna be a
problem [INAUDIBLE].

571
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:36,490

572
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,610
Let's first do y star.

573
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,320
Cause that's the
most direct one.

574
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,820
Sorry.

575
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,830
I think that my story
I got backwards.

576
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,914
But we'll figure this out.

577
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:44,413
OK.

578
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:44,930
Ready?

579
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,430
OK.

580
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,080
So the question is,
there's a population

581
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,300
that you want to-- all right.

582
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,540
Now I'm going to redo
my story to make it--

583
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,640
but there's a population you
want to keep in check somehow.

584
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,000
So you might reasonably
go out and shoot it.

585
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,355
Right?

586
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:00,730
So the question
is, if you go out

587
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,400
and you do this on
the predator, at least

588
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,670
in this model, what happens?

589
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,170
All right.

590
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,740
Ready.

591
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,940
Three, two, one.

592
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,690
Right.

593
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,739
So although we actually
have a fair number

594
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:13,780
of disagreements on this.

595
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,690

596
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,810
So we're actually kind
of 50-50 at this stage.

597
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,520

598
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,280
What is it if you go out
and from the helicopter,

599
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,470
you start shooting
this animal, what

600
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,570
does that do from the
standpoint of this model?

601
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,070
Right.

602
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,260
So we're shooting the predator.

603
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,170

604
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,720
a, b, c, d, what you think?

605
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,601
What should it change?

606
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:44,100
c.

607
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,330
And does c go up or go down?

608
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,320
C goes up.

609
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,010
OK.

610
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,255
Well, how does
that affect y star?

611
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

612
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,034

613
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

614
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,885
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

615
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:00,694

616
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:01,360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

617
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,860
Right.

618
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,550
You know, I mean, I'm thinking
daily helicopter rides

619
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,185
where you shoot wolves
as you see them.

620
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:09,226
AUDIENCE: This is Canada.

621
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:10,309
PROFESSOR: This is Canada.

622
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,090
This is Canada.

623
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,782
Yeah, those Canadians.

624
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:16,973
AUDIENCE: So effectively,
you're changing the death rate

625
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,265
of-- that's what you're saying.

626
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:19,098
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

627
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:19,900
So that's my claim.

628
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,330
Of course, all of these things
can be more complicated.

629
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,470
But it certainly is
change in the death rate

630
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,580
when you go and shoot them.

631
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,330
So I guess I would say
that in the context

632
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,705
of this model, that's the
simplest way to think about it.

633
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:38,580

634
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,397
So the statement is that
if you hunt this predator,

635
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:44,480
you're increasing the death
rate for the predator.

636
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,410
You're increasing c.

637
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,950
Hunting predator.

638
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,960
This causes c to go up.

639
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,120
And the striking thing is
that y star does not change.

640
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,620
OK.

641
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,092

642
00:29:58,092 --> 00:30:00,076
AUDIENCE: I believe you.

643
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,467
I think it's funny.

644
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,050
PROFESSOR: OK.

645
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,156
[LAUGHS] You believe me.

646
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:04,279
OK, I'm glad.

647
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,570
One thing is believing me in
the context of this model.

648
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,780
Another thing is asking whether
this is happening in real life.

649
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,460
But I think people have
seen such weird phenomenon

650
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,416
in the context.

651
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,790
But then of course,
it's a matter

652
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,020
of is this a dominant source?

653
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,740
What's going on?

654
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,080
Like many, many things.

655
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,881
Right.

656
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,380
But certainly in
this model, there's

657
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,130
this weird phenomenon where
the death rate of the predator

658
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,360
does not alter this y star.

659
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,860
OK.

660
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,401
We have to figure out what the
y star means here in a moment.

661
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:38,290

662
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:44,360
What is the effect on
this fixed point number

663
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,810
concentration of the prey?

664
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,030
It goes up.

665
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,420
So my original story, I
think I was getting confused.

666
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,180
So at least in
this model there's

667
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,660
a sense that if you
hunt the predator,

668
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,210
it's true that you don't
bring down the steady state,

669
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,600
or the time average-- we'll
see-- time averaged number

670
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,300
of the predator population.

671
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,190
But you do increase
the prey population.

672
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,277
Because in this case
you can help the prey.

673
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,860
But you don't bring
down the predator.

674
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,960

675
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,790
Now I want to say something
more about justifying

676
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,370
this thing about why we might
care about x star and y star

677
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,870
so much.

678
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,460
So this thing is x star/y star.

679
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,374

680
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:28,040
Well, maybe all.

681
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,771

682
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:35,270
Yes.

683
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,735
AUDIENCE: As soon as
you stop shooting,

684
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,693
this is a very
temporary solution.

685
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:43,170
When you stop shooting, c goes
back to its original value.

686
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,220
PROFESSOR: That's right.

687
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,120
When you stop
shooting, c goes back

688
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,290
to its original model,
or original value.

689
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,020
And then the prey population
will come back down.

690
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
So this is something you
have to continue to do.

691
00:31:53,020 --> 00:32:00,720

692
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,190
Yes.

693
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,440
What do I wanna say?

694
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,070
If you go ahead
and you calculate

695
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,170
the-- if we linearize around
this fixed point x star/y

696
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,240
star, that's our standard
thing that we did early

697
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,920
on the semester, what we
find is that this Jacobian,

698
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,000
this matrix A, the linearized
matrix you get is-- all right.

699
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,650
Well, we come here and we take
the derivative with respect

700
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,310
to x.

701
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,485
So we get a minus by.

702
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:35,840

703
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,000
Derivative of this guy
up top with respect to y.

704
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,440
And we get minus bx.

705
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,120

706
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,900
And derivative of this g
function with respect to x.

707
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,520
We get dy.

708
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,810
Now aspect to y, we
have a minus c plus dx.

709
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,870
Now we want to evaluate
this around that fixed point

710
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:07,410
at x star/y star,
which is given here.

711
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,920
We plug this in.

712
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,220
So evaluate at y star.

713
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,845
It's a over b 0.

714
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:17,340

715
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,770
Evaluate at x star.

716
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,280
This is just minus bc over d.

717
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,360

718
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,960
Now y star, this is ab over b.

719
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,770

720
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,410
And here we can get 0.

721
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,210

722
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,510
So this is telling us about
the linearized dynamics

723
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,550
around a fixed
point x star/y star.

724
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,590

725
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,315
Now for this sort of matrix,
what are the eigenvalues?

726
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:58,642

727
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,660
It's not that the
eigenvalues are 0.

728
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,400
It's a slightly
different statement.

729
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:44,679

730
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,989
What are the eigenvalues
for a matrix like this?

731
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,620
What's that?

732
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,800
AUDIENCE: They're imaginary.

733
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,508
PROFESSOR: Right.

734
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,610
They're purely imaginary.

735
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,040
So the real part
is equal to zero.

736
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,309
So indeed, we can
figure out this.

737
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,600
Cause remember, to figure
out what the eigenvalues are,

738
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,500
you take the determinant
of this vector

739
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,015
a minus this lambda times
the identity matrix.

740
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:10,600

741
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,610
So we end up with, we want to
take the determinant of-- we

742
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,140
have a minus lambda,
a minus lambda,

743
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,530
and then minus bc over d.

744
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:29,367

745
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,325
This is lambda squared.

746
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:33,970

747
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:40,750
And then this is a plus, we
have bc over d, ab over b.

748
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:49,300

749
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,020
So we end up that
the eigenvalues

750
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,273
are equal to plus minus
square root of a times ci.

751
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:57,570

752
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,585
So they're purely
imaginary eigenvalues.

753
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:07,711

754
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:08,960
And what does this mean again?

755
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:25,800

756
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,520
What can you say when you
do this sort of analysis

757
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,270
and you have purely
imaginary eigenvalues?

758
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:37,136

759
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:39,432
AUDIENCE: The orbits look
like ellipses or something

760
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,272
like that.

761
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:41,980
PROFESSOR: Right.

762
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,130
So the statement is that-- OK.

763
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,310
And then we have to be careful
in all of this business.

764
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,210
So what we've done
is we've taken

765
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,770
a set of non-linear, a pair
of non-linear differential

766
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,340
equations.

767
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,000
We've done the linear
stability analysis.

768
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,080
And we get purely imaginary.

769
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,290
So one thing that you can
say is that if you started

770
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,770
with a linear
system, and you got

771
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,420
purely imaginary eigenvalues,
that would tell you

772
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,860
that indeed, you have these
neutrally stable orbits,

773
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,710
they go around.

774
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,940
They can have a variety
of different shapes.

775
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,832
But given that the order
that we did things in

776
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:19,290
is that we took a
nonlinear system,

777
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,697
and we linearized,
and then got this.

778
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,030
What does that allow you to say?

779
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:32,730

780
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,200
Does that prove
that you actually

781
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,410
have these neutrally
stable [INAUDIBLE]?

782
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,520
Yeah.

783
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,120
Because this is one
of those border cases,

784
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,370
it unfortunately
does not actually

785
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,040
allow you to say that you
have neutrally stable orbits.

786
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,250
Because it turns out that
the slight nonlinearities

787
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,330
in the equations
could cause problems,

788
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,580
and cause it to go either
to a stable limit cycle

789
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,570
or to a stable spiral.

790
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,790
The confusing thing
is that in this case

791
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,140
it is true that you have
neutrally stable orbits.

792
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,410
But that did not
have to be true.

793
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,010
And guys will get the chance
to do this proof and so forth.

794
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,625
Because there some
conserved quantities.

795
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,000
Of course, people have analyzed
this thing in more depth.

796
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,550
And it is true that you have
neutrally stable orbits.

797
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,820
But what is very
hard to remember

798
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,320
is that it didn't have
to be the case just based

799
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,910
on what we've said so far.

800
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,410
Yeah.

801
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,535
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned,
it's not a coincidence.

802
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:35,180
There is a deeper reason why?

803
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,522
PROFESSOR: Well, coincidence.

804
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,980
I guess what I'm
saying is that you

805
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,700
can prove that this
thing does have

806
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,860
these neutrally stable orbits.

807
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,090
But we have not proven that.

808
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,382
And we're not going to.

809
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:50,590

810
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:55,180
Do these orbits go around
clockwise or counterclockwise?

811
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,680
Ready.

812
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,475
Three, two, one.

813
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:01,600
AUDIENCE: Counterclockwise.

814
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,700
PROFESSOR: Counterclockwise.

815
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,199
Right.

816
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,554
And you can get that
from thinking about what

817
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,720
predator and prey should do.

818
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,916
But also I've already
drawn some arrows here.

819
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,790
And that kind of helps
provide some guidance.

820
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,370

821
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,980
So they kind of come
around like this.

822
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,360
Now is this the only orbit
that I should be drawing here?

823
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,280
No.

824
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,990
Right.

825
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,120
Because it turns out
that in this case

826
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,670
there are an
infinitely large number

827
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,238
of orbits that could
possibly come around.

828
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:39,451

829
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:39,950
Yes.

830
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

831
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:44,340

832
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

833
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,157
Well, in the context
of our simulation,

834
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,240
the simplest thing that
you guys would probably do

835
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,300
is you would simulate and
see what comes around.

836
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,290
But yeah.

837
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,767
I think even in the
reading, did they prove it?

838
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:59,350
Different authors in different
books either prove it or don't.

839
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,040
And there are a
number of different--

840
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,930
you'll see in the
problems, you can

841
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,440
find that there is a
quantity that is conserved

842
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,870
along the equations of motion.

843
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,020

844
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,821
But the quantity's different
for each of these orbits.

845
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:18,320
Right.

846
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,820
So it's really saying
that as you go,

847
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,236
there's some
quantities conserved.

848
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:23,980
And it still has the same
value when you go around.

849
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,896
And so that means you
had to kind of come back

850
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:28,040
to where you were.

851
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,077
So there is a
conserved quantity.

852
00:40:31,077 --> 00:40:31,660
You'll see it.

853
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,680

854
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,230
Now these neutrally
stable orbits

855
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,170
are kind of funny
in several ways.

856
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:54,180

857
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,470
Well, first of all,
this eigenvalue

858
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,740
tells you about the
period of the orbits

859
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,420
when you're close
to the fixed point.

860
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,917

861
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,500
And you can see that
it doesn't depend

862
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,625
on everything in the model.

863
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:11,530
It depends on a and c.

864
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,110
Does that kind of
make sense, maybe?

865
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,420

866
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:17,920
Yeah.

867
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,580
Sort of.

868
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,270
Cause a is telling us about
how rapidly we grow up here.

869
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,190
c is talking about how
rapidly we die over here.

870
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,930
So you know, it has
something that at least

871
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,850
has units of 1 over time.

872
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,120

873
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,560
It makes sense that a
and c should appear here.

874
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,669
But I would submit that it's
not totally obvious that b

875
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:41,960
and d should not appear at all.

876
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,960

877
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,230
So neutrally stable
orbits, there's

878
00:41:51,230 --> 00:42:04,000
no characteristic amplitude to
the oscillations, nor period.

879
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,410

880
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,580
And this is at least true
far from the fixed point.

881
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,986
This tells you about
maybe these orbits.

882
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:16,360
But then it doesn't tell you
about what happens far away.

883
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,640

884
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,110
And these are not the
kind of oscillations

885
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,230
that from a
mathematical standpoint

886
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,000
we like the most,
which are limit cycles.

887
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,810
And remember, a limit
cycle would look like this.

888
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,450
If it were a limit
cycle, it would

889
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,390
be that there's some orbit
that is stable in the sense

890
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,810
that if you start
inside of it, then

891
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,450
you would approach it over time.

892
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,117
If you start outside
of it, then again,

893
00:42:45,117 --> 00:42:46,450
you would approach it over time.

894
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,070

895
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,670
And this orbit then would have
a characteristic amplitude,

896
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:59,909
and a characteristic period,
because it's one orbit.

897
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,950
Whereas here, this has
kind of an infinite number

898
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,039
of different orbits.

899
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,580
What this means is
that just any sort

900
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,180
of noise-- demographic
fluctuations and so forth--

901
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,010
would cause the system to
drift over time in terms

902
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,044
of this amplitude of period.

903
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:14,919
So it's true that if
you got it started

904
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,460
in the absence of
any noise, it would

905
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,750
keep on doing that oscillation
forever with that amplitude.

906
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,220
But any random noise will
cause the thing to drift.

907
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:36,470

908
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,295
The other thing that
is worth stressing

909
00:43:38,295 --> 00:43:42,110
in this is that if you do a
time average of the predator

910
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,890
concentration, or the
prey concentration,

911
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:57,820
so if you do the average or the
mean, x as a function of time,

912
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,910
or y is a function of time
is indeed x star y star.

913
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,180
That's also something
that you'd have to show.

914
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,120
Not at all obvious from this.

915
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,840
It's not a surprise for these
orbits that are out here that

916
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,620
the time average is
indeed x star /y star.

917
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,380
But for these big orbits,
they probably already

918
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,050
didn't have to be.

919
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,666
So this is telling us that the
analysis that we were talking

920
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,040
about-- well, what
happens if you

921
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,990
do one thing or another
thing-- that's actually

922
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,360
kind of a reasonable quantity
to be trying to calculate,

923
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,760
because that is the
average or the mean number

924
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,140
of predator/prey in this model.

925
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,740

926
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,560
Yes.

927
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,440
AUDIENCE: So in a
zombie apocalypse,

928
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,330
how do we thin down
the zombie [INAUDIBLE].

929
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,060
PROFESSOR: Yes.

930
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,550
That's a very
important question.

931
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,610
In the event of a
zombie apocalypse,

932
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,400
what do we have to do
in order to thin out

933
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,810
the zombie population?

934
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,310
All right.

935
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,676
Well, the zombie
movies typically

936
00:44:58,676 --> 00:44:59,800
are not yet at equilibrium.

937
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,720

938
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,520
But certainly at equilibrium,
what do you want to do?

939
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,040

940
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,160
This is not a formal
recommendation, by the way.

941
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,770
But in this model, if
you want to decrease

942
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,576
the number of the predator,
what is it that we want to do?

943
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:27,810

944
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,310
Right.

945
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:28,840
Well, OK.

946
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,690
So in this model, if
you want to decrease

947
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,000
the number of the
zombies at equilibrium,

948
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,124
you want to decrease a,
which corresponds to--

949
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:42,576
AUDIENCE: So it's
a is equal to 0.

950
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,512
So the birth rate is
equal to the death rate,

951
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:46,944
then there aren't new zombies.

952
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:47,610
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

953
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,020
There are probably
also no people.

954
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,020
AUDIENCE: But there are.

955
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,699
The birth rate is
equal to the-- so you

956
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:52,810
have a stable population.

957
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,518
PROFESSOR: Right.

958
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,190
So in the limit, as
a goes to 0, it's

959
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,280
true that the number
of zombies goes to 0.

960
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,208

961
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,605
AUDIENCE: So you just
have to beat [INAUDIBLE].

962
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:03,230
PROFESSOR: Yes.

963
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,520

964
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,270
This is a good
situation where it's

965
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,770
important to ask about whether
your assumptions in the model

966
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,811
are good before making
public policy based on them.

967
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:16,901
OK?

968
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:17,400
Indeed.

969
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,410

970
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,260
But can we go back
just for a moment

971
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,165
before we switch gears, to
ask about this question of why

972
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:36,270
it was that war might have
favored these predator fish?

973
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,730
And by favored, what
he really measured,

974
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,920
he measured the number
of the frequency

975
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,590
of these kind of predator
fish at the markets.

976
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,940
So it's somehow is maybe the
ratio of those two, or so.

977
00:46:48,940 --> 00:47:00,170

978
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,010
Yeah.

979
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:01,580
That's right.

980
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,350

981
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,700
Yes, it could that the
fisherman just-- yeah.

982
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,070
So they could have fished
in a different region.

983
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,861
And so the explanation
could be something--

984
00:47:14,861 --> 00:47:16,860
AUDIENCE: Because it's
not very well controlled.

985
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,100
PROFESSOR: It's not a
controlled experiment.

986
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,590
That's why you need to have
many different wars in order

987
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,175
to average the
importance of large data.

988
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:27,860

989
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,182
AUDIENCE: That's going to
be a great [INAUDIBLE].

990
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:31,890
PROFESSOR: Right.

991
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,556
And then of course,
in all this business

992
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:36,500
you have to ask, well, which
thing are you varying more

993
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,010
or less, et cetera, et cetera.

994
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,340
But let's say that
to first order,

995
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,715
the fishermen are
going out there

996
00:47:42,715 --> 00:47:44,298
and they're just
catching all the fish

997
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:45,350
in an unbiased fashion.

998
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,650
But the war is making it
more difficult to fish.

999
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,610
So not as many fishermen go out.

1000
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:53,025
And then what does that
do to these parameters?

1001
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:55,811

1002
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:56,310
Right.

1003
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,420
So it might increase a,
because the prey are not

1004
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,970
getting caught as much.

1005
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,060
And it might do something
also to the predator.

1006
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,560
What?

1007
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:10,329

1008
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:12,120
So the predator fish
are also being caught,

1009
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,120
cause they're showing
up at the market.

1010
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,620
Right.

1011
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,415
So which other parameters
does it change?

1012
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:25,640

1013
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,625
So what's that?

1014
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1015
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:27,950
PROFESSOR: Right.

1016
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:28,890
So lets be clear.

1017
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:36,080
It's a war makes a go down.

1018
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,580
All right.

1019
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,190

1020
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,480
And what other
parameter might change?

1021
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,240

1022
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,767
AUDIENCE: Fewer fishermen.

1023
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:47,350
PROFESSOR: Oh.

1024
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:47,850
I'm sorry.

1025
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,729
I'm sorry.

1026
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:50,270
You're right.

1027
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:50,930
You're right.

1028
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,600

1029
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,660
I was starting to think
about the next one.

1030
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,160
OK.

1031
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,270
So a goes up.

1032
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:00,110
And what also happens?

1033
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:00,960
And c goes down.

1034
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,720
And this is just because a is a
growth rate. c is a death rate.

1035
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,750
So it's not that the
fishermen are preferentially

1036
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,095
changing what they're
doing between the prey

1037
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:15,079
fish and the predator
fish, but it's

1038
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,870
just that these are
defined different ways.

1039
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,720
Right?

1040
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,880
And in particular, what this
means is that in times of war,

1041
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,490
Voltaire's argument to
his future son-in-law

1042
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:29,130
was that what you expect is that
the predator population should

1043
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,550
go up.

1044
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,700
And the prey population
should go down.

1045
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,070
So the ratio of them
should certainly

1046
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,859
shift in favor of the predator.

1047
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:39,400
Or maybe it's just
that the fishermen

1048
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,280
didn't go into the deep
regions of water or something,

1049
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,980
where predator fish
like to hang out.

1050
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,370
But it's striking at least
that a simple model like this

1051
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,380
can actually provide
some insight.

1052
00:49:51,380 --> 00:50:00,510

1053
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,682
Any questions about
where we are before we

1054
00:50:02,682 --> 00:50:03,890
modify the model in some way?

1055
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:15,270

1056
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,220
Now, the problem
with this model is

1057
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,850
that it's making
lots of assumptions

1058
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,430
that we very much
think are not true.

1059
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,910
So we have a few of the
assumptions up there.

1060
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,672

1061
00:50:30,672 --> 00:50:32,130
Which ones are you
guys least happy

1062
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,310
about among those assumptions?

1063
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,181

1064
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:38,680
Yeah.

1065
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,020
The second one, the prey
grows exponentially,

1066
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,220
i.e., without bound.

1067
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,790

1068
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,210
That's not physical.

1069
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,540
We should fix that.

1070
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,330
So let's go ahead and do that.

1071
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:49,910
All right.

1072
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:57,581
So real prey populations-- and
all populations-- populations

1073
00:50:57,581 --> 00:50:59,450
saturate.

1074
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,540
Don't go to infinity, right.

1075
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,150

1076
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,540
We can just make a quick
little fix to our model

1077
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,770
to capture this, right?

1078
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,780
X dot.

1079
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,160
So now it's going to be this ax.

1080
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,930
But what we can do is we can
add a logistic term here.

1081
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,130

1082
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,880
And we can leave
everything else constant.

1083
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:34,170

1084
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,590
So we just add this
logistic row term.

1085
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,180
So now in the absence
of a predator, what

1086
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,670
will happen is that the
prey population saturates

1087
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,690
at some point, at some value k.

1088
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,430
Right?

1089
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,490
And k could be rather
large, if you like.

1090
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,610

1091
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,604
And I think this is
the kind of situation

1092
00:51:56,604 --> 00:51:58,020
where you say, oh
well, that could

1093
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,060
be just a really modest change.

1094
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,110
Because it's primarily
telling us about what

1095
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,310
happens kind of in the
absence of the predator.

1096
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:10,400
But really, the dynamics
around here could be unchanged.

1097
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,270
But what's striking
is that because

1098
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,860
of this neutral
stability of the model,

1099
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,110
any little change can lead
to a qualitative change

1100
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,540
in the outcome at equilibrium.

1101
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,280
And in particular, adding
a carrying capacity

1102
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,830
causes the sustained
oscillations to disappear.

1103
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,365
Instead you get
damped oscillations.

1104
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:33,320

1105
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,090
So in this case, xy, you
still have this fixed point.

1106
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:44,790
But what happens is that you
get-- it orbits the look.

1107
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,700
Kind of like this.

1108
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,220
Yes.

1109
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,136
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1110
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,769

1111
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:51,560
PROFESSOR: Yeah OK.

1112
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,870
So that depends
upon [INAUDIBLE].

1113
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:58,590
And indeed, as k
goes to infinity,

1114
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:02,616
the timescale of this decay
goes to infinity as well.

1115
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:07,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
clean scaling.

1116
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,984
PROFESSOR: A clean scaling.

1117
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:10,567
AUDIENCE: But I mean
just [INAUDIBLE].

1118
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:13,075

1119
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:18,820
PROFESSOR: I mean, I don't have
nothing intelligent to say.

1120
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,970
But what I can say is
that if you put in a k

1121
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:27,650
at values that are close
to this fixed point,

1122
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,810
then the oscillations
really disappear.

1123
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,240
It's really only as
k goes way, way out.

1124
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:40,890

1125
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,860
And I maybe won't
do this calculation.

1126
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,151
But you can do it quickly.

1127
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:47,650
It's the kind of thing you can
do in five minutes on an exam

1128
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:48,332
or so, right?

1129
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,986

1130
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:52,610
But then the question
you might ask me,

1131
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:55,951
well what can you do in order to
get these oscillations that we

1132
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:56,450
really like?

1133
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,410
These sustained limit
cycle oscillations?

1134
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,370
And there are two ways
you can think about this.

1135
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,610
One is by a kind of
taking this sort of model

1136
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,680
and adding features and
playing with it and so forth.

1137
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,060
Or you can ask a mathematician
who kind of derives everything

1138
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,200
in kind of totality.

1139
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,500
And then you can see it.

1140
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,650
I'll say that one thing you
can do on a concrete basis

1141
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:23,770
to change the outcome of this
is you can add something that

1142
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:29,570
is kind of like some
saturation effect

1143
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:34,350
at the level of the interaction
between predator and prey.

1144
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:40,430
So instead of scaling
purely as x times y,

1145
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:46,600
if instead there some sort of
Michaelis-Menten type behavior

1146
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,500
as a function of the
prey, then this model

1147
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,360
is actually converted to one
that has a stable limit cycle.

1148
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,190
And in this case,
can you guys remember

1149
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,892
how you show that something
has a stable limit cycle?

1150
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:14,784

1151
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:15,284
Yes.

1152
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:18,260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
use the Poincare--

1153
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1154
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,730
There's this
Poincare-Bendixson theorem,

1155
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,630
which tells us that if we
can draw some box out here

1156
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:30,025
where the trajectories are all
kind of coming in, indeed, here

1157
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,650
the trajectories are
kind of coming in.

1158
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,020

1159
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,230
Now in this case
the trajectories

1160
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,830
have to come in everywhere.

1161
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,930
But this is
typically true in any

1162
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,380
of these reasonable systems.

1163
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,120
Because they should, if there's
just not that much food,

1164
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,850
they should be coming in.

1165
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,962
Now in this case, there's
a single fixed point.

1166
00:55:52,962 --> 00:55:55,170
So then the question of
whether there's a limit cycle

1167
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,450
is equivalent to the
question of the stability

1168
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,140
of this interior fixed point.

1169
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,080
It's a stable fixed point,
then all of these trajectories

1170
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,250
will spiral in.

1171
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,420

1172
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,310
However, if it's an
unstable fixed point,

1173
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,685
then you have to have a limit
cycle oscillation somewhere

1174
00:56:10,685 --> 00:56:11,990
in between.

1175
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,148
Yes.

1176
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:16,016
AUDIENCE: It could be that
it's a stable midpoint.

1177
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:19,840
And then you have
two limit cycles.

1178
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,202
Could that be?

1179
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:22,910
PROFESSOR: Right.

1180
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,370
So the question is whether
there can be a stable limit

1181
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:30,130
cycle and two limit cycles.

1182
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,550
I think that that requires
more fixed points.

1183
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:40,500
Because let's say you
had a limit cycle here.

1184
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,750
That this is saying that
the trajectories come in.

1185
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,680
But it's also saying the
trajectories are coming out.

1186
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,620
I think that you have to have
a fixed point inside here

1187
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:53,120
in order to have these
trajectories going--

1188
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,362
AUDIENCE: So what I'm
saying [INAUDIBLE]

1189
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:58,743
two circles, and way
outside, all the trajectory

1190
00:56:58,743 --> 00:57:00,250
is [INAUDIBLE].

1191
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,124
But between the two
circles, the trajectories

1192
00:57:02,124 --> 00:57:04,539
go from the outer circle
to the inner circle.

1193
00:57:04,539 --> 00:57:08,370
And then from the inner
circle in [INAUDIBLE].

1194
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,750
PROFESSOR: Are the circles
encircling each other?

1195
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,697
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1196
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:12,280
PROFESSOR: OK.

1197
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,380
So here's one circle.

1198
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,670
Here's another circle.

1199
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,950
And the trajectories
are coming into this one

1200
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,245
and what are they doing?

1201
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:23,920
AUDIENCE: So each of these limit
cycles are only semi-stable.

1202
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,744
There are some--

1203
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:25,410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1204
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:25,909
All right.

1205
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,640
All right.

1206
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,390
So you're talking about
these limit cycles

1207
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,260
where the trajectories
come to it from one side,

1208
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,000
but then leave from
the other side.

1209
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,650

1210
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,750
I'd have to think
about this more.

1211
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,300
Everything that
I'm talking about

1212
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,897
are the limit cycles that
are stable from both sides.

1213
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,230
And I think that in the
presence of any amount of noise,

1214
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,790
those are the only ones
that we care about.

1215
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,791
Because you can write these
models where you have orbits

1216
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,790
that are stable from one
side but not the other.

1217
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:58,169
But then they don't
matter in any real system

1218
00:57:58,169 --> 00:57:59,210
that is subject to noise.

1219
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,590
Because it's not a stable
orbit in that case, right?

1220
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:04,412
AUDIENCE: Then we can make
the outer circle stable

1221
00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:06,570
from both sides, and the
inner circle [INAUDIBLE]

1222
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:11,080
from both sides, and we
could get it [INAUDIBLE].

1223
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,010
PROFESSOR: OK So it
could go like this.

1224
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,885
So you're saying that
this outer orbit is now

1225
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,130
stable from both sides.

1226
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,620
And then this one is
unstable from here.

1227
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,090
And oh, OK.

1228
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,940
Now you're saying this thing
is unstable from-- so now

1229
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,528
it's stable.

1230
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:29,986
AUDIENCE: So we can have--

1231
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:34,965

1232
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:35,590
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1233
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:35,790
OK.

1234
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,510
So I can certainly
draw the trajectories,

1235
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,470
as you pointed out.

1236
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,220
And it works.

1237
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,781

1238
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:43,280
Yeah.

1239
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,696
I don't know if
this is a loophole

1240
00:58:44,696 --> 00:58:47,500
in the wording of the theorem,
or if this is just not

1241
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,390
possible.

1242
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:53,850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] There's
like one way in which it

1243
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,350
applies.

1244
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,400
And then the other way
you kind of usually

1245
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,080
think that it applies,
but then you're

1246
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,038
wrong because there are
these counter examples.

1247
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:00,920
PROFESSOR: I see.

1248
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,230
Well, how about this.

1249
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,180
I will look it up.

1250
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:08,520
And then I will tell you
what I think the answer is.

1251
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,270
I'm certainly not going to be
able to derive it on the spot.

1252
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,970
But You're right, though.

1253
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,042
I can draw the orbits
and they do it.

1254
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:20,250
I don't know what that means.

1255
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,612

1256
00:59:24,612 --> 00:59:26,070
AUDIENCE: So I
think the theorem is

1257
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,171
if on this large circle
on the outside everything

1258
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:30,435
is coming in, then if your
fixed point is unstable,

1259
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:32,894
then you must have at least
one stable [INAUDIBLE] outside.

1260
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:34,935
Or you must have at least
one that is [INAUDIBLE]

1261
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:35,970
or something like that.

1262
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:36,553
PROFESSOR: OK.

1263
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,110
But you're saying that it--

1264
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,400
AUDIENCE: But if you flip it
so the fixed point is stable,

1265
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,182
then you could have--

1266
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:44,890
PROFESSOR: I see.

1267
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:45,980
That may be right.

1268
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,810

1269
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,460
I can't remember
which direction.

1270
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,940

1271
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,370
But I'll look it up.

1272
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,950
But if you are curious about
the situations in which

1273
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,310
these predator/prey functions
will have limit cycles,

1274
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,730
you can look up
Kolmogorov's conditions.

1275
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:11,440
So he basically has
these four conditions

1276
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,430
in which you will
get a stable limit

1277
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,140
cycle in the
predator/prey populations.

1278
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,640
And maybe I will.

1279
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,450
And they're surprisingly simple.

1280
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:32,039

1281
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:33,080
They were in the reading.

1282
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,210
So you can look at them.

1283
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,790
But they're basically just these
questions of the derivatives.

1284
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,730
And they're derivatives of
the per capita growth rates.

1285
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,010
So you take those
functions, you divide by x.

1286
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,250
So it's x dot over x.

1287
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,230
And then it's some f,
y dot over y, sub g.

1288
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:51,740
And the derivatives of
those functions withe

1289
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,570
respect to x and y
have to be something,

1290
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,050
at least in some limits.

1291
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,990
And then you get limit cycles.

1292
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,150
But I want to talk
about the experiments.

1293
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,450
Because I think that
they were quite pretty.

1294
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,160

1295
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,740
So this is a paper
by Yoshida, et al.

1296
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:16,290

1297
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:27,340
This is Nature 2003.

1298
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,380
And the title was "Rapid
Evolution Drives Ecological

1299
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,031
Dynamics in a
Predator/ Prey System."

1300
01:01:33,031 --> 01:01:34,780
Could somebody kind
of say what they think

1301
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,020
is the big point of this paper?

1302
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:50,936

1303
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:55,560
Do you guys like the
paper, dislike the paper?

1304
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,210
Too long?

1305
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,330
Was it three pages?

1306
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,304

1307
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:02,470
Although it's really only--
I mean, one of the pages

1308
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,870
is figures.

1309
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,370
And one of the pages
is essentially methods.

1310
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:09,000
So it's really basically
a one-page paper,

1311
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,550
so it's not such
heavy lifting, maybe.

1312
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:19,340

1313
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:19,840
All right.

1314
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,970
Maybe I'll be concrete.

1315
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:25,230
What features of their
predator/prey oscillations

1316
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,876
were different from a normal
predator/prey oscillation?

1317
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,000
What were the features they
were trying to explain?

1318
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,175

1319
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:40,607
AUDIENCE: There's a longer
phase life between the maximum.

1320
01:02:40,607 --> 01:02:42,940
PROFESSOR: And this is an
interesting history, actually,

1321
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,970
that these are authors-- they
took what I think are basically

1322
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,200
like samples from the Great
Lakes, or something like that.

1323
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,210
So they took a
predator and prey.

1324
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:59,070
So it's a rotifer algal system.

1325
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:02,920
So the rotifer eats algae.

1326
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,840

1327
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,937
They had previously published a
paper just a few years before,

1328
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:11,770
where it was called
something like "Crossing

1329
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,640
the Hopf Bifurcation in
a Predator/Prey System."

1330
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,380
And so what they did is
they had a chemostat where

1331
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,330
there was some constant rate
of dilution in their chemostat.

1332
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:24,100
And then they measured the
dynamics between the predator

1333
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,780
and the prey.

1334
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,980
And they showed
that depending upon,

1335
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,670
for example, the
nutrients or this dilution

1336
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,240
rate in their chemostat, they
could go from a situation

1337
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,066
where you have a
stable coexistence--

1338
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:40,190
so a stable fixed point
between the predator/prey--

1339
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,510
but at increasing dilution
rate, they started

1340
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:45,990
getting these oscillations.

1341
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:49,070
So they went from
stable to oscillations.

1342
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,880
And then at higher
dilution rates,

1343
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,330
they got collapse of this
predator/prey system.

1344
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,590
So this is crossing the
so-called Hopf bifurcation,

1345
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:59,350
where you go from
stable to unstable.

1346
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:03,440
So they could actually see that
they could use a simple model

1347
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,910
to try to get some
insight into why

1348
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,737
it is that a predator/prey
system might oscillate

1349
01:04:06,737 --> 01:04:07,950
or it might not oscillate.

1350
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,880

1351
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,040
And so that was great.

1352
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,790
But there were some
features in their data

1353
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,220
that they didn't understand.

1354
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:21,090
So the features were
that the oscillations

1355
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,280
had a really long period.

1356
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,030

1357
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,100
Long period oscillations.

1358
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:35,360

1359
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,820
And in all this data,
it's a little bit hard

1360
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,550
to get the exact phase lag,
but in many of the cases

1361
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,830
they saw that the
predator and prey were not

1362
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,380
at this 90 degrees out of
phase like you would expect.

1363
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,930
And in particular,
for the predator/prey,

1364
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,380
given that you have x and y, and
it's going around some circle,

1365
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,840
the idea is that first
the prey population peaks.

1366
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:07,080
And then kind of 90
degrees later phase,

1367
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,960
you get a peak of the predator.

1368
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,190
And you can imagine that
in any predator/prey model

1369
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,265
that you write down,
not just Lotka-Volterra,

1370
01:05:17,265 --> 01:05:19,140
but if you write down
a differential equation

1371
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:23,980
with some x and some y,
it's hard to get something

1372
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,800
where it looks much different.

1373
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,740
Of course, you can imagine
maybe funny orbits or something

1374
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,920
like that.

1375
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:36,040
But generically you really
expect this 90 degree phase

1376
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,320
lag of the predator
relative to the prey.

1377
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,137

1378
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:42,720
Whereas in the
experiments, they often

1379
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:57,204
saw 180 degree lag, lack of
predator relative to the prey.

1380
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:57,704
Yes.

1381
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,184
AUDIENCE: So when you
say [INAUDIBLE] theory

1382
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:02,664
of oscillation,
what does that mean?

1383
01:06:02,664 --> 01:06:04,650
What's the time scale?

1384
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,517
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1385
01:06:05,517 --> 01:06:08,380
AUDIENCE: What would make
this suprisingly [INAUDIBLE]?

1386
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,251
PROFESSOR: Right.

1387
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:09,750
Yeah.

1388
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,930
OK.

1389
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,805
So this is really in
the context of-- I mean,

1390
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:14,800
they wrote down a model
where they did basically have

1391
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,514
something like this, where
they said there's some--

1392
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:21,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1393
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,830
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1394
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,390
And in particular the
predator, I think,

1395
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,260
was not really
dying on it's own.

1396
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,300
Except for the dilution.

1397
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,920
So it's really the dilution rate
from the chemostat gave them c.

1398
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,570
And they could see that indeed,
the rotifer wasn't dying much.

1399
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,150
And then a is telling
you about what

1400
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,834
happens if you don't
have the rotifer,

1401
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,000
you don't have the predator.

1402
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,680
And then at that
dilution rate, you

1403
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,050
ask what the division rate is.

1404
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,530
And that's essentially
the growth rate

1405
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:50,360
of that prey population
minus the dilution

1406
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,560
rate of the chemostat.

1407
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,880
I'd say that they had these
parameters pretty well.

1408
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:01,620

1409
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:02,120
Yes.

1410
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,740
And what they saw experimentally
was that it took much longer.

1411
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:12,264
I mean, the period was
5 times, 10 times longer

1412
01:07:12,264 --> 01:07:13,680
than what they
would have expected

1413
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,810
based on the measured parameters
for the predator and the prey.

1414
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:24,980

1415
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,140
And of course, that
was annoying for them,

1416
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,400
because they're actually
doing the experiments.

1417
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,483
So they had to do these
chemostat experiments that

1418
01:07:31,483 --> 01:07:33,660
lasted six months or
something like that, in order

1419
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,770
to see a couple oscillations.

1420
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:40,120
And so this longer period
wasn't just a mathematical--

1421
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,270
I'm sure that they were
disappointed to see

1422
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,734
these really long time-scale
oscillations, because it was

1423
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,650
something that made it
very difficult for them

1424
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,608
to do the measurements.

1425
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:51,940

1426
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,670
But this is what they
saw experimentally.

1427
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,970
And they didn't know
what was causing it.

1428
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:02,600
But they later then
did more modeling

1429
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,880
where they asked, which
of the assumptions

1430
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,200
in our original model
might not be true.

1431
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,685
And the nature of
these things is

1432
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:12,060
that there are an
infinite number

1433
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:16,380
of things are true that are
not incorporated in the model.

1434
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,939
And this makes it
quite challenging

1435
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:19,569
to isolate what the
effects might be.

1436
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:22,960
But at the very least what
they can do is they can go in.

1437
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,944
And they have some
sense of their system.

1438
01:08:24,944 --> 01:08:26,319
And they can make
guesses of what

1439
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:27,960
might have been the
primary things missing.

1440
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,290
And then they kind of
went through the models

1441
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,749
and they asked,
well, if we kind of

1442
01:08:30,749 --> 01:08:32,498
change this assumption
or that assumption,

1443
01:08:32,498 --> 01:08:34,439
what does it do in terms
of the oscillations.

1444
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:37,729
And then what they found
in a modeling paper--

1445
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:41,779
so this is their previous
experimental paper before this.

1446
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:46,020
What they found in
their models was

1447
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:50,259
that prey evolution was
kind of the one thing

1448
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,100
that if they allowed
prey evolution, i.e.

1449
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,450
If they allowed
different types of prey

1450
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,029
in their prey
population that might

1451
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:58,840
be oscillating
independently, then they

1452
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,670
could get both of these effects.

1453
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,240
So from the models
they concluded

1454
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,420
that prey evolution
could give this,

1455
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,950
could maybe explain
those two things.

1456
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:14,613

1457
01:09:14,613 --> 01:09:16,279
These are the two
experimental features.

1458
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:19,819

1459
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:21,064
Yeah.

1460
01:09:21,064 --> 01:09:22,540
AUDIENCE: It might
be that you have

1461
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,508
[INAUDIBLE] symantic point.

1462
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:29,889
If you have two types of
species, pre-species--

1463
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:34,116
[INAUDIBLE] they have
these characteristics

1464
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:36,044
and they're not evolving.

1465
01:09:36,044 --> 01:09:37,490
They're just fixed.

1466
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,356
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1467
01:09:38,356 --> 01:09:39,939
AUDIENCE: You would
still be able to--

1468
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:40,479
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1469
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,979
Right.

1470
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:41,826
This is a major--

1471
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:42,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1472
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1473
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,618
You can argue about what you
want to call evolution and not

1474
01:09:45,618 --> 01:09:47,359
revolution.

1475
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:51,350
Over these time scales what
they are not looking at

1476
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:55,070
is the de novo kind of emergence
of new mutants spreading

1477
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:55,990
in the population.

1478
01:09:55,990 --> 01:10:00,410
What they're looking at
is variations in say,

1479
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,703
different types of prey.

1480
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:08,020
AUDIENCE: So is that what
we would call evolution?

1481
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,450
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

1482
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:10,700
This is a major question.

1483
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,926
I think different people call
evolution different things.

1484
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:15,550
And in particular
there's a distinction

1485
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:22,100
between the ecologists and
the evolutionary biologists,

1486
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,250
or evolutionary
microbiologists, or whatnot.

1487
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:29,390
And this is something that
I certainly encounter.

1488
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,310
For the experimental
microbial evolution guys,

1489
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,224
I'd say that for them, if you
use the word "evolution," what

1490
01:10:35,224 --> 01:10:36,890
they really want to
see, or what they're

1491
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,930
expecting to see is kind
of new mutants arising

1492
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,479
in the population,
spreading, fixing,

1493
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,520
and that changes the
character of the population.

1494
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,110
Whereas from that
standpoint of ecologists--

1495
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,880
and indeed, if you look up
the definition of evolution,

1496
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,660
it's some change in allele
frequency over time.

1497
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,200
And this could certainly be
a change allele frequency

1498
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,010
over time in the sense that you
could imagine this arising just

1499
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:03,630
from, for example, there
could be a point mutation

1500
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:06,470
in some gene that leads it
to do something or another.

1501
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,070
And in this paper
they didn't identify

1502
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,070
exactly what was going on.

1503
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,236
I'll tell you a little bit
about a later paper where

1504
01:11:11,236 --> 01:11:12,540
they get a better sense of it.

1505
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,540
But at least you could
imagine it being the case

1506
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,700
that there's just a point
mutation, some gene that

1507
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,750
has some fitness defect in
the absence of the predator,

1508
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,541
but then allows the algae to
avoid the predator in some way.

1509
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:25,490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1510
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,629
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1511
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:27,170
That's right.

1512
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,080
As far as the model
goes, it could

1513
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,800
be that the prey are
really-- one species was just

1514
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,550
a point mutation.

1515
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,550
Then you'd say, oh yeah.

1516
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,420
That's kind of evolution.

1517
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:40,230
Or it could be two different
prey populations and so forth.

1518
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:40,730
Right?

1519
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:44,330
And depending upon what
information you have access to,

1520
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:46,899
you would either be aware
of these things or not.

1521
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:48,940
In this case, they just
look under the microscope

1522
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,790
and say, oh yeah, this looks
like an algae, or whatnot.

1523
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:54,040
And maybe they know that
it's the same species.

1524
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:58,570
But they could be different
in lots of different ways.

1525
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:01,830
And I think this
discussion is highlighting

1526
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:07,290
that a lot of the same effects
that you see in ecology also

1527
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,420
you see in evolution
and vice versa.

1528
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:15,019
And depending upon
your focus, you

1529
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:17,060
might want to put it more
in the bin of evolution

1530
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,850
or in terms of
population dynamics.

1531
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:23,890
I think that's a matter of
taste at some point, actually.

1532
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:24,390
Yeah.

1533
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,764
Because they say
rapid evolution.

1534
01:12:25,764 --> 01:12:27,001
And I think--

1535
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:29,800

1536
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,302
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1537
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:32,260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

1538
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,352
So I think that
different people will

1539
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:36,560
have different takes on this.

1540
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,018
I think, once again,
this is really

1541
01:12:38,018 --> 01:12:39,980
very much from the
standpoint of an ecologist,

1542
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,040
this is rapid evolution.

1543
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,674
Because every cycle, the
allele frequency is changing.

1544
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:47,340
And that's what's
maybe leading to this.

1545
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,670
But the thing is,
it's very easy for you

1546
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,720
to read certainly the
title, and come away

1547
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,270
thinking it's something
different from what it was.

1548
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,780

1549
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,403
I agree.

1550
01:12:57,403 --> 01:13:00,930

1551
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:04,150
But one of the things I
like about this whole line

1552
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,720
of research that took place over
the course of say, 15 years,

1553
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,060
was that they did these
nice measurements.

1554
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,050
They're guided by models.

1555
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,430
They saw some things
that they were expecting,

1556
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:18,960
some things they
couldn't explain.

1557
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,869
And then they went
and did more modeling.

1558
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,160
And then they could explain it.

1559
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,162
And that guided this experiment.

1560
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:27,870
Because before what
they did is they just

1561
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,954
took kind of the sludge,
or whatever, from the lake.

1562
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:32,370
So there were many
different types

1563
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:34,360
of algae and of the
rotifer, for that matter.

1564
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,610
And then they looked at the
predator/prey oscillations

1565
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,480
between those.

1566
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,090
And then in this
paper what they did

1567
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,470
is they took individual
prey populations that

1568
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:42,990
came from a single prey.

1569
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,619
So they were kind of isogenic.

1570
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:48,160
Of course eventually they would
evolve, and blah, blah, blah.

1571
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,190
But in this case they
took individual isolates

1572
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,090
from the prey.

1573
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:56,120
And then what they saw is that
these two features went away.

1574
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,540
The oscillation period was
more what they were expecting.

1575
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,740
And they got the 90
degree phase lag.

1576
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,160
So it's was really a
case of these models

1577
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:13,720
led to the experiments where
they took kind of clonal prey.

1578
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,160
And then they recovered
their classical predictions.

1579
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:27,440

1580
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,172
And indeed, they've recently
done some other measurements

1581
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:32,380
that I think were quite nice.

1582
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,760
They had an ecology letters
paper just a couple years ago

1583
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,450
where what they did is they
took two different algae that

1584
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:47,310
had different types embodying
these trade-offs that we

1585
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,530
were talking about.

1586
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:53,970
In particular, one of the
algae can divide rapidly.

1587
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,840
But it kind of
exists as singles.

1588
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,240
Another algae is kind of clumpy.

1589
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,920
So this algal type was
able to divide more rapidly

1590
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,220
than this algal type.

1591
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:12,070
But this type was harder to
eat just because it was clumpy.

1592
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,630
OK?

1593
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:18,220
It's one of things that once
you hear it, you say, oh yeah.

1594
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:18,780
Sure.

1595
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:24,510
But then in the abstract,
when you read this 2003 paper,

1596
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:27,720
you think, oh, I can't
imagine what kind of behavior

1597
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:31,190
could possibly help the
algae avoid these rotifers.

1598
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,710
But then in this ecology
letters paper, what they did

1599
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:38,070
is they actually tracked
population densities

1600
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:42,090
of this type, this type, and
of the rotifer over time.

1601
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:46,024
So then they could see all three
sub-populations oscillating.

1602
01:15:46,024 --> 01:15:47,440
So then you can
really kind of see

1603
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,710
how this evolution, if you
want, or you could just say it's

1604
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,210
ecology.

1605
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,620
Because it could be different
species for all we care.

1606
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,970

1607
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:02,380
But in any case, it's certainly
prey heterogeneity anyway you

1608
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:02,880
look at it.

1609
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,296
Whether it's
evolution or ecology.

1610
01:16:04,296 --> 01:16:07,930
It's heterogeneity in
the prey population that

1611
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,194
leads to these
very qualitatively

1612
01:16:11,194 --> 01:16:12,610
different population
oscillations.

1613
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,730

1614
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,480
Any other questions
on that before we--

1615
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,050

1616
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,550
And so just for the
last few minutes

1617
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,620
I'll say something
about this question

1618
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:29,040
of noise-induced oscillations.

1619
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,890
This is going to
be something you're

1620
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:35,630
going to be playing
with over the next week.

1621
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:39,940
So you'll be experts eventually.

1622
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,300
And the discussion
in the homework

1623
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,680
is really guided by this
paper by McKane and Newman.

1624
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,290

1625
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:50,830
All right.

1626
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,570
So McKane.

1627
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,200
Newman.

1628
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,300
McKane is a professor
at Manchester.

1629
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:03,360
And what they showed is that
if you take this model here,

1630
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,560
did this model have
limit cycle oscillations,

1631
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,520
sustained oscillations?

1632
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,560
No.

1633
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,160
So this model where we
include the carrying

1634
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,920
capacity of the
prey, this does not

1635
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,380
have sustained oscillations.

1636
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:23,350
So you take a model like this
that just has a stable spiral.

1637
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,200
Now this is a model in
the context of-- it's

1638
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,270
a differential equation model.

1639
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:33,080
Now the question is, how
do you incorporate noise?

1640
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,730
Just the fact that
individuals give birth,

1641
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:37,140
they die at random times.

1642
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,860

1643
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,260
The first order way that we
often think to do this is we

1644
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:46,270
just add some noise on to
the differential equations.

1645
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:50,010
So what we do is, you might say,
oh well, you could add some a

1646
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:54,390
to x, and some a to y.

1647
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,970
Maybe this noise should be
proportional to x or something.

1648
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:00,000
So you could think about
the strength of this

1649
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,180
might be some pre-factor.

1650
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,550
So you could just take kind
of a [INAUDIBLE] approach

1651
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,480
where you add noise onto
the differential equations.

1652
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,800
And then what you
get is a noisy kind

1653
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,155
of path to that fixed point.

1654
01:18:16,155 --> 01:18:21,940
The perhaps surprising thing
is that instead of adding noise

1655
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,280
to a differential
equation, if instead you

1656
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,670
start with the individual
based approach,

1657
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,300
and you take kind
of a master equation

1658
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,810
approach where you say
they're individuals

1659
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,420
and they're doing something.

1660
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:35,740
Individual predators are eating
individual prey, et cetera.

1661
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:44,160
So if instead you take
a master equation,

1662
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,210
just like what we
did for the chemical

1663
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,406
equations modeling
the cells and so forth

1664
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:52,530
that we talked about at
the beginning of the class,

1665
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,780
if you formulate this
predator/prey system

1666
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:00,460
as an underlying set of kind of
individual based interactions,

1667
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:04,720
then what you actually find is
that you get surprisingly large

1668
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,250
sustained oscillations.

1669
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,800
So you really end
up with a situation

1670
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,350
where this thing comes.

1671
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:14,580
And it's noisy, of course.

1672
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,450
But it kind of comes
around here in some way

1673
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,200
that looks like this.

1674
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,380
And you'll see this in your
simulations next week where--

1675
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,750
and I don't know if you
can see this at all.

1676
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,590
But this is some plots
of predator and prey

1677
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:33,420
at reasonably large numbers,
where you can actually

1678
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,520
have 1,000 predator or prey.

1679
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,880
Somehow you can get some
sort of resonant enhancement

1680
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,190
of these oscillations.

1681
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,660
And kind of what's
going on is that

1682
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:46,720
the demographic fluctuations
of the demographic noise

1683
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,720
excites the system
at all frequencies.

1684
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,240
But then there is a
characteristic frequency

1685
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,150
given basically
by this frequency

1686
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,180
of the inherent
oscillation there

1687
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,500
that is somehow amplified.

1688
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,000
So you end up with
a situation where

1689
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,125
you get these oscillations.

1690
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:06,690

1691
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:09,020
And they're noisy and whatnot.

1692
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:13,570
But it's really because it's
this particular frequency that

1693
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,280
was amplified.

1694
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,010
And just because it takes
a long time for those

1695
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,340
oscillations to go away.

1696
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,580
So you can imagine that the
amplitude of the oscillation

1697
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,020
falls off as kind of
a root end scaling,

1698
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,130
because it's kind of a
demographic type noise.

1699
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:31,715
So it is true that
the relative amplitude

1700
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:33,940
of these oscillations,
it gets larger as you

1701
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,890
to smaller population sizes.

1702
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:40,850
But it still ends up being
a surprisingly large effect.

1703
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,910
And you'll see how this plays
out in this model that's

1704
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,680
basically guided by this paper.

1705
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,030
And this was a PRL in 2005.

1706
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,650
Incidentally, other
people have since

1707
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,010
studied how these
sorts of ideas can

1708
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:56,935
result in noise-induced
pattern formation, as well.

1709
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,399
All right, with that,
I will let you guys go.

1710
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:00,440
Have a good Thanksgiving.

1711
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,810
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
