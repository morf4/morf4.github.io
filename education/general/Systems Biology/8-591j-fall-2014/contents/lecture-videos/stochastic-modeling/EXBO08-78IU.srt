00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,782

10
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:22,240
PROFESSOR: Today
what we want to do

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,660
is discuss various
approaches that you

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,360
might want to take towards
trying to understand

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,330
stochastic systems.

14
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,085
In particular, how is it that
we might model or simulate

15
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,820
a stochastic system?

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,870
Now, we will kind of continue
our discussion of the master

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,280
equation from last time.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,160
Hopefully now you've kind of
thought about it a bit more

19
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,410
in the context of the reading.

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,280
And we'll discuss kind of what
it means to be using the master

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,717
equation and how to formulate
the master equation for more

22
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:47,800
complicated situations,
for example, when you have

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,240
more than one chemical species.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,020
And then we'll talk about the
idea of this Gillespie method,

25
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,730
which is an exact way to
simulate stochastic systems,

26
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,550
and it's both exact and
computationally tractable as

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,120
compared to what you might
call various naive methods.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,040
And the Gillespie
method is really sort of

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,150
qualitatively different
from the master equation

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,860
because in the master
equation, you're

31
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,730
looking at the evolution of
probability distributions

32
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,800
across the system, whereas
the Gillespie method is really

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,670
a way to generate individual
stochastic trajectories.

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,060
So if you start with somehow
similar initial conditions,

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,430
then you can actually
get-- you can

36
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,781
get, for example, the
probability distributions

37
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,280
from the Gillespie
method by running

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,870
many individual trajectories.

39
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,949
But it's kind of
conceptually rather different

40
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:38,740
because of this notion
of whether you think

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,323
about probabilities
or you're thinking

42
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:44,150
about individual instantiations
of some stochastic trajectory.

43
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,390
So we'll try to make
sense of when you might

44
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,990
want to use one or the other.

45
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,400
And then finally we'll talk
about this Fokker-Planck

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,850
approximation, which, as
the reading indicated,

47
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,390
for intermediate ends,
it's useful to make

48
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,206
this kind of continuous
approximation,

49
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,830
and then you can get
a lot of intuition

50
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,710
from your knowledge
about diffusion

51
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,680
on effective
[INAUDIBLE] landscapes.

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,740
Are there any questions about
this or administrative things

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,020
before we get going?

54
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,210
I just want to remind you
that the midterm is indeed

55
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,600
next Thursday evening, 7-9 PM.

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
If you have a problem
with that time,

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,592
then you should have
emailed [? Sarab. ?]

58
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,050
And if you haven't
emailed him yet,

59
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,930
you should do it right now.

60
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,790
And-- yes.

61
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,130

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,630
All right.

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,740
So let's think about the master
equation a little bit more.

64
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,459
Now before what we did is we
thought about the simplest

65
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,250
possible case of the
master equation, which

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,230
is, if you just have
something being created

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,710
at a constant rate and then
being degraded at a rate that's

68
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,600
proportional to the number
of that chemical species.

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,640
And I'm going to be using
the nomenclature that's

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,440
a little bit closer to what
was in your reading, just

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,810
for, hopefully, clarity.

72
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,580
And I think that some of my
choices from last lecture

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,640
were maybe unfortunate.

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,670
So here, this is, for example,
m would be the number of mRNA,

75
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,200
for example, in the cell.

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,460
This is the rate of
creation of the mRNA,

77
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,800
and then the rate of
degradation of the mRNA.

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,450
So m is the number of mRNA.

79
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,820

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,845
And if we want understand
gene expression,

81
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,720
we might include an
equation for the protein,

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,120
so we might have some
p dot, where some Kp.

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,850

84
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,550
Now-- oh, sorry.

85
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,420
Again, I always do this.

86
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:46,920
All right.

87
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,890
So we're going to
have this be an n dot.

88
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,030

89
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,630
So now n is going to be
the number of the protein.

90
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,790

91
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,110
Now this really is kind of
the simplest possible model

92
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,630
that you might write down for
gene expression that includes

93
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,080
the mRNA and the protein.

94
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,370
So there's no
autoregulation of any sort.

95
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,820
It's just that the
mRNA is involved

96
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,284
in increasing the
protein, but then we

97
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,950
have degradation of
the protein as well.

98
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,510

99
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,010
So what we want to
do is kind of try

100
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,760
to understand how to formulate
the master equation here.

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,250
But then also, we
want to make sure

102
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,541
that we understand what the
master equation is actually

103
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,430
telling us and how
it might be used.

104
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,020
So first of all, in this
model, I want to know

105
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,260
is there, in principle,
protein bursts?

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,920

107
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,580
So before we talked about
the fact that in-- at least

108
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,170
in [? Sunny's ?]
paper that we read--

109
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,750
they could observe
protein bursts,

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,460
at least in those
experiments in e Coli.

111
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:06,160
Question is, should this model
somehow exhibit protein bursts,

112
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,130
and why or why not?

113
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,770
I just want to see
where we are on this.

114
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,570

115
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,934
I think this is
something that, depending

116
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,350
on how you interpret
the question,

117
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,058
you might decide the
answer is yes or no.

118
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:25,229
But I'm curious-- I think
it's worth discussing

119
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,520
what the implications are here.

120
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,917

121
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,500
And the relevant
part of this is going

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,125
to be the discussion
afterwards, so I'd

123
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,170
say don't worry too much about
what you think right now.

124
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,120
But I'm just curious.

125
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,240
This model, does it include,
somehow, protein bursts?

126
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,990
Ready?

127
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,130
Three, two, one.

128
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,630
OK.

129
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,110
So we got-- I'd say at
least a majority of people

130
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,790
are saying no.

131
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,061

132
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,560
But then some people
are saying yes.

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,120
So can somebody
volunteer why or why not?

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,620
Yes?

135
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,010
AUDIENCE: I think the difference
is if we're-- are we using this

136
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,820
in a continuous fashion or are
we using this in a discrete

137
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,004
fashion [INAUDIBLE].

138
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:16,670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

139
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:16,940
OK.

140
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,210
All right.

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,710
All right.

142
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,690
So he's answered both possible
sides of the argument.

143
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,530
And the point here
is that if you just

144
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,470
simulate this from
the standpoint--

145
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,250
certainly, for example,
this continuous,

146
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,720
this discrete-- so
if you just simulate

147
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,690
this as a deterministic pair
of differential equations,

148
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,940
then will there be bursts?

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,280
No.

150
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,510
Because everything
is well-behaved here.

151
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,770
On the other hand, if we go
and we do a full Gillespie

152
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,350
simulation of this
pair of equations, then

153
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,210
in the proper parameter
regime, we actually

154
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,690
will get protein bursts,
which is, in some ways,

155
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,210
weird, that depending upon
the framework that you're

156
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,730
going to be analyzing
this in, you

157
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,630
can get qualitatively
different behaviors for things.

158
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,270
But there's a sense here that
the deterministic, continuous

159
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,780
evolution of these quantities
would be the average over many

160
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,840
of these stochastic
trajectories,

161
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,130
and the stochastic
ones do have bursts,

162
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,921
but if you average over
many, many of them,

163
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:23,910
then you end up getting some
well-behaved pair of equations.

164
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,290
So we'll kind of try to make
sense of this more later on.

165
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,560
But I think this just
highlights that you

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,800
can get really qualitatively
different behaviors

167
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,690
for the same set of
equations depending

168
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,770
upon what you're looking at.

169
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,460

170
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,990
And these protein bursts can
be dramatic events, right,

171
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,900
where the protein
number pops up by a lot.

172
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,510
So this really,
then, if you look

173
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,570
at the individual
trajectories here,

174
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,460
they would look very
different whether you

175
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,170
were doing kind of a
stochastic treatment

176
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,211
or the deterministic one.

177
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,040

178
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,600
Can somebody remind
us the situation

179
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,250
in which we get protein bursts
in the stochastic model?

180
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,390
In particular, will we always
get these discrete protein

181
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,285
bursts?

182
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,540
Or what determines the
size of a protein burst?

183
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,921

184
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:15,420
Yes.

185
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,128
AUDIENCE: Does it have
to do with the lag

186
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,704
time between when the mRNA
is created [INAUDIBLE]?

187
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:23,987

188
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:24,570
PROFESSOR: OK.

189
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,069
Right.

190
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,850
So there's a lag time between
the time that mRNA is created,

191
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,040
and then the next
thing would be--

192
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,908
AUDIENCE: When the
protein [INAUDIBLE].

193
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:35,667

194
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,750
PROFESSOR: When the protein
is [? totaled-- ?] OK.

195
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,929
So there are multiple
time scales, right?

196
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,150
So after an mRNA is
created, and that's

197
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,210
through this process here--
so now out pops an mRNA--

198
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,430
now there are
multiple time scales.

199
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,870
There's the time scale
for mRNA degradation.

200
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,050
That goes as 1 over gamma m.

201
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,800
There's a time scale
for protein degradation

202
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,380
after a protein is made.

203
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,590
That goes as 1 over gamma p.

204
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,120
But then there's also
a time scale associated

205
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,530
with kind of the rate
of protein production

206
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,010
from each of those mRNAs,
and that's determined by Kp.

207
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,997
So we get big protein
bursts if what?

208
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,840

209
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,620
What determines the size
of these protein bursts?

210
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,593

211
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:27,093
Yes.

212
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:27,968
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

213
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:39,172

214
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:39,880
PROFESSOR: Right.

215
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,796
It's always confusing.

216
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,100
We talk about times.

217
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,270
But in particular, we
have protein bursts

218
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,630
in the stochastic situation if
we do a stochastic simulation.

219
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,360
And that's in the
regime if Kp, the rate

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,370
of protein synthesis
from the mRNA

221
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,530
is somehow much larger
than this gamma m.

222
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,850

223
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,060
Have I screwed up?

224
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,540
Yes.

225
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,305
AUDIENCE: So this is
also-- in the sense

226
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:12,643
of being different from the
deterministic equations,

227
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:17,824
we probably also want the total
number of mRNAs [INAUDIBLE].

228
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:18,770
Is that sort of--

229
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,500
PROFESSOR: Right.

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah, I think that it--
and the question of what

231
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,850
mRNA number you need.

232
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,100
I mean, it depends on what
you mean by protein bursts.

233
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,960
I would say that so
long as this is true,

234
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,110
what that means is that each
mRNA will, indeed, kind of lead

235
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,090
to a burst of proteins being
made, where the burst is,

236
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,120
again, geometrically
distributed with some--

237
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,970
now there's another question,
which is, are those protein

238
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,790
bursts kind of large compared
to the steady state protein

239
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,670
concentration?

240
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,390
And that's going to depend
upon Km and gamma p as well.

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,125
Is that--

242
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

243
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,670
So I guess [INAUDIBLE] which
is, I guess it would also

244
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,187
depend on how big [INAUDIBLE].

245
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,770
PROFESSOR: All right, well-- and
you're saying time resolution

246
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,336
in terms of just measuring--

247
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,460
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]

248
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

249
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,430
Well, OK, but right
now we're kind

250
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,388
of imagining that we live
in this perfect world

251
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,480
where we know at
every moment of time

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,220
exactly how many of
everything there is.

253
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,580
So in some ways we haven't
really said anything yet

254
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,540
about time resolution.

255
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,750
We're assuming that our time
resolution and our number

256
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,454
resolution is actually perfect.

257
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,620
But still, depending upon
the regime that you're in,

258
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,640
the protein numbers
could look something

259
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,790
like-- so if you look at
the protein number, which

260
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,150
is defined as this n as
a function of time, then

261
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,820
in one regime, you're going
to see where it's kind of low.

262
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,590
You get a big burst and then
it kind of comes down, and then

263
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,276
a big burst, and then it kind
of comes down, and burst,

264
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,650
and it kind of
comes down, right?

265
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,710
So this is in the regime where
you have infrequent mRNAs being

266
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,220
produced, and then large
size bursts from each mRNA.

267
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,510
And then you kind of get
this effective degradation

268
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,740
or dilution of the
protein numbers over time.

269
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,700
And this distribution, if
you take a histogram of it,

270
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,335
is what?

271
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:18,390

272
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,332
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

273
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:21,040
PROFESSOR: Right.

274
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,940
So I'm imagining that we look at
this for a long period of time.

275
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,370
And then we come over
here and we histogram it.

276
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,020
So now we come over here,
we turn to the left,

277
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,200
we say number has a function
of-- this is number n.

278
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,490
The frequency that we observe,
some number of proteins.

279
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,320
So frequency.

280
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,145
And this is going
to do something.

281
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:47,120

282
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,050
So what about-- it may not
be a beautiful drawing,

283
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,690
but you're supposed
to know the answer.

284
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,870
I'm trying to review
things for you because I

285
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,760
hear that you have a
big exam coming up,

286
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,010
and I want to make sure that--

287
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,565

288
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:02,065
Gamma.

289
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,470
It's a gamma, right?

290
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,520
So this is what we
learned earlier.

291
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,250
So this is a gamma distribution.

292
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,375
And you should know what this
gamma distribution looks like.

293
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,420
In particular, there
are these two parameters

294
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,961
that describe this
gamma distribution

295
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,500
as a function of underlying
parameters in the model.

296
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,456
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

297
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:25,240

298
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,840
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

299
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,590
I don't want to get too much
into this because, well,

300
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,960
on Thursday we spent a
long time talking about it.

301
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Once we get going, we'll
spend another long time

302
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,250
taling about it again.

303
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,920
But you should review your notes
from Thursday before the exam.

304
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,150

305
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,670
So this thing is
gamma distributed.

306
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,710
And if we looked at the mRNA
number as a function of time

307
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,990
and we did a histogram of
that, the mRNA distribution

308
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,320
would be what?

309
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,290
It's poisson.

310
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,989
So it's important to remember
that just because I tell you

311
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,780
that a protein number
is gamma distributed,

312
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,160
that doesn't immediately tell
you exactly what you should

313
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,660
be expecting for the
distribution of, say,

314
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,520
the number of protein
as a function of time.

315
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,490
I mean, there are
many different things

316
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,090
I could plot over here that
would all kind of come down

317
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,645
to a gamma
distribution over here.

318
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,020
So it's important
to kind of keep

319
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,350
in mind the different
representations that you might

320
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,558
want to think about the data.

321
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:33,075

322
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,700
So what we want to do now is we
want to think a little bit more

323
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,400
about this master equation
in the context of if we're

324
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,980
going to divide it
up into these states.

325
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,570
Now I would say that
any time that you

326
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,240
are asked to write down the
master equation for something--

327
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,990
so now how many equations
will the master equation-- I

328
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,730
say master equation, but there
is really more than one, maybe.

329
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,800
So how many equations will be
involved in the master equation

330
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,260
kind of description
of this model?

331
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,440

332
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,320
Infinitely many.

333
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,111
But there were infinitely
many already when

334
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:19,510
we had just one, when we just
had the mRNA distribution.

335
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,420
Well, you know, infinite times
infinite is still infinite.

336
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,160
So long as it's a
countably infinite number.

337
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,490
But yeah, but it's
still infinite, always.

338
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,430
All right.

339
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,800
So what we want to do
is divide up the states.

340
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,580
So when somebody asks you for--
the equation's describing how

341
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,410
those probabilities
are going to vary,

342
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,260
really what we're interested in
is some derivative with respect

343
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,410
to time of some probabilities
described by m,n.

344
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,220
We want to know the derivative
with respect to time for all

345
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,140
m,n's.

346
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,470
So that's why there are infinite
number, because m goes in one

347
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,400
direction, n goes in another.

348
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,560
Lots of them, OK?

349
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,680
Now it's always tempting to
just write down this derivative

350
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,600
and then just write
down the equation.

351
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,270
If you do that,
that's fine, but I

352
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,930
would recommend
that in general what

353
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,540
you do is you try to
write a little chart out

354
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,280
to keep track of what
directions things can go.

355
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,220
So for example, here we have
the probability of being the m,n

356
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,000
state.

357
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,180
Now there's going to
be ways of going here.

358
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,165
And this is going to be going
probability of being an m plus

359
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:30,665
1,n.

360
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:38,006

361
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,000
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to give you

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,330
just a couple minutes.

363
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,590
And in two minutes, I want you
to try to write down as many

364
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,240
of the rates, the f's
and n's that correspond

365
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,472
to all these transitions.

366
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:53,430
You may not be able to
get through all of them,

367
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,590
but if you don't try to
figure out some of them,

368
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,404
then you're going to
have trouble doing it

369
00:16:58,404 --> 00:16:59,070
at a later date.

370
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:14,819

371
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,230
Do you understand what
I'm asking you to do?

372
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,819
So next to each one
of these arrows,

373
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,944
you should write something.

374
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:24,480

375
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,290
So I'll give you two
minutes to kind of do

376
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,617
your best of writing
these things down.

377
00:17:28,617 --> 00:19:38,410

378
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:38,910
All right.

379
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,660
Why don't we reconvene,
and we'll see how we are?

380
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,290
So this is very similar to
what we did on Thursday.

381
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,195
We have to remember
that m's are the mRNAs,

382
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:54,750
and this is what
we solved before,

383
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,430
where it's just a long row.

384
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,910
Now first of all, the mRNA
distributions and the rates,

385
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,607
do they depend on
the protein numbers?

386
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,950
No.

387
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,250
So what that mean about,
say, this arrow as

388
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,980
compared to the arrow
that would be down here?

389
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,550
It's going to be the
same, because n does not

390
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,310
appear in that equation
describing mRNA.

391
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,630
If we had autoregulation of
some sort, then it would.

392
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,550

393
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,641
So let's go through.

394
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,140
All right.

395
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,681
What we're going to
do is we're going

396
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:31,880
to do a verbal yelling out.

397
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,055
OK, ready.

398
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:33,555
This arrow.

399
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,770
AUDIENCE: Km.

400
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,100

401
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,655
PROFESSOR: This one
here is, 3,2,1--

402
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,360
AUDIENCE: Km.

403
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,060
PROFESSOR: Km.

404
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,720
All right.

405
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,890
All right.

406
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,754
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

407
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,080
AUDIENCE: Gamma m times m.

408
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,300
PROFESSOR: Gamma m times m.

409
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,880
3, 2, 1.

410
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,810
AUDIENCE: Gamma
n times m plus 1.

411
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,720
PROFESSOR: Gamma
m times m plus 1.

412
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,910
Now remember that there are
more mRNA over here then there

413
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,050
are here, which means that
the rate of degradation

414
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,633
will increase.

415
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:06,900

416
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,040
Now coming here,
now this is talking

417
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,710
about the creation
and destruction

418
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,326
of the proteins, changes in n.

419
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:14,450
All right, this arrow here.

420
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,080
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

421
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,984
AUDIENCE: Kp times m.

422
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:21,100
PROFESSOR: It's Kp times m.

423
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,980
So this is the rate of creation,
going from n minus 1 to n.

424
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,070
That's fine.

425
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,010
You know, I was looking at
my notes from last year,

426
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,440
and I got one of these things
incorrect, so-- and then,

427
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,030
OK, ready.

428
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,440
This one here, 3, 2, 1.

429
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,600
Kp times m.

430
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,805
So here the same rate, and
should we be surprised by that?

431
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,430
So the number of
proteins are changing,

432
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,760
but here it's the
number of mRNA that

433
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,410
matters, because we're talking
about the rate of translation,

434
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,170
right?

435
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,590
Now this one here, 3, 2, 1.

436
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,720
Gamma p times n.

437
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,204
And here, 3, 2, 1.

438
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:04,860
AUDIENCE: Gamma
p times n plus 1.

439
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,590
PROFESSOR: Gamma
p times n plus 1.

440
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,220
All right.

441
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,380
Perfect.

442
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,350
Now this is, of course, as
you can imagine, the simplest

443
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,790
possible kind of set
of equations that we

444
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,170
could have written down.

445
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,750
If you have other
crazy things, you

446
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,500
get different distributions,
if you have autoregulation

447
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,790
or if you have
interactions of something

448
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,940
with something else, or
the same thing, so forth.

449
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,190
But I think it's
really very useful

450
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,930
to kind of write this thing
down to clarify your thinking

451
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,220
in these problems.

452
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,640
And then you can fill out--
for change of probability,

453
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
you have mn.

454
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,490
You come here and
you just go around

455
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,010
and you count, take all
the arrows coming in,

456
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,300
and those are ways of
increasing your probability.

457
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,260
And ways going out are ways of
decreasing your probability.

458
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,830
Now in all those cases you have
to multiply these raw rates

459
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,163
by the probabilities of being
in all these other states.

460
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:06,220

461
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,850
So can you use the
master equation

462
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,332
to get these probabilities
if you're out of equilibrium,

463
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:13,165
out of steady state?

464
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:16,776

465
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:17,650
So that's a question.

466
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,220
So the master equation
useful out of steady state?

467
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:30,390

468
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,540
Yes.

469
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,350
Ready.

470
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,425
3, 2, 1.

471
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:39,020

472
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,520
All right.

473
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,780
So we got a fair number of--
there is some disagreement,

474
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,280
but yeah.

475
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,360
So it actually--
the answer is yes.

476
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,649
And that's because you can
start with any distribution

477
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,940
of probabilities across all
the states that you'd like.

478
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,231
It could be that all of the
probabilities at one state.

479
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,930
It could be however you like.

480
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,310
And the master
equation tells you

481
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,934
about how that
probability distribution

482
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:04,800
will change over time.

483
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,770
Now if you let that
run forever, then you

484
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,870
come to some equilibrium
steady state.

485
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,965
And that's a very
interesting quantity,

486
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:15,298
is the steady state distribution
of these probabilities.

487
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,450
But you can actually calculate
from any initial distribution

488
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,329
of probabilities evolving
to any later time t what

489
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,620
the probability would be later.

490
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,470

491
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,950
This comes to another
question here.

492
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,450
All right.

493
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,270
So let's imagine that
at time t equal to 0,

494
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,530
I tell you that there
are m not mRNA and P

495
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:41,056
not-- I always do this.

496
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:46,780
I don't know, somehow my
brain does not like this.

497
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,770
Because the P's we want
to be probabilities.

498
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,400

499
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,670
We start with m not
mRNA, n not protein.

500
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,050

501
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,270
And maybe it's a
complicated situation.

502
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,925
We can't calculate
this analytically.

503
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:03,550
So what we do is we
go to our computer,

504
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:08,150
and we have it solve how this
probability distribution will

505
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,330
evolve so that time T
equal to some time--

506
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,920
if we'd like we
can say this is T1.

507
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,141
I'll tell you, oh, the
probability of having m and n

508
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,390
mRNA and protein is going
to be equal to something P1.

509
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,210

510
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,450
Now the question is,
let's say I then go

511
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,090
and I do this simulation again.

512
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,110

513
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,150
Now I calculate some
other at time T1 again,

514
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,420
the probability that
you're in the m,n state.

515
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,530
The question is, will
you again get P1?

516
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,905

517
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,030
So this is a question mark.

518
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,770
And A is yes, B is no.

519
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:56,750

520
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,250
All right.

521
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm going to give
you 15 seconds.

522
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,970
I think this is very
important that you understand

523
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,610
what the master equation is
doing and what it is not doing.

524
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:15,884

525
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:18,850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

526
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,040
PROFESSOR: I'm
sorry, what's that?

527
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,540
Right.

528
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,040
OK.

529
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,950
So I mean, this is
just-- you know,

530
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,979
you program in your
computer to use the master

531
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:34,770
equation to solve how
the probabilities are

532
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,150
going to evolve.

533
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,760
I'm just telling you, start
with some initial distribution.

534
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,725
And if you do it
once, it says, oh,

535
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,100
the probability
that you're going

536
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,250
to have m-- this time you're
going to have mRNA proteins is

537
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,550
going to be P1, so it's 10%.

538
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,460
Great.

539
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,350
Now I'm asking just, if you
go back and do it again,

540
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,510
will you again get 10%, or
is this output stochastic?

541
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:04,990

542
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,080
It's OK that if you're
confused by this distinction.

543
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,830
I think that it's easy
to get confused by,

544
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,420
which is why I'm doing this.

545
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,250
But let's just see where we are.

546
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,020
Ready?

547
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,180
3, 2, 1.

548
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,150

549
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,650
All right.

550
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,880
So I'd say a majority again.

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
We're kind of at
the 80-20, 75-25.

552
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,090
A majority here are
saying that, yes, you

553
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,270
will get the same probability.

554
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,020
And this is very important
that we understand

555
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,520
kind of where this where
the stochasticity is somehow

556
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,640
embedded in these
different representations

557
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,560
of these modelings.

558
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,500

559
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,210
The master equation is a set of
differential equations telling

560
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,720
you about how the
probabilities change over time

561
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,800
given some initial conditions.

562
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,580
Now we're using these
things to calculate

563
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,239
the evolution of
some random process,

564
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,655
but the probabilities themselves
evolve deterministically.

565
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:06,090

566
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,080
So what that means is that
although these things are

567
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,232
probabilities, if
you start somewhere

568
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,940
and you use the master
equation to solve,

569
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,520
you get the same thing
every time you do it.

570
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,045
Now this is not true for
the Gillespie simulation,

571
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:23,160
because that, you're looking
at an individual trajectory.

572
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,830
An individual trajectory,
then the stochasticity

573
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,340
is embedded in that
trajectory itself,

574
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,322
whereas in the master equation,
the stochasticity arises

575
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,530
because these are probabilities
that are calculating,

576
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,635
so any individual instantiation
will be probabilistic

577
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,010
because you are sampling from
those different probability

578
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,593
distributions.

579
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:44,750

580
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,350
Now this is, I think, a
sufficiently important point

581
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,820
that if there are
questions about it,

582
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,260
we should talk about it.

583
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,071

584
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:56,571
Yeah.

585
00:28:56,571 --> 00:29:00,220
AUDIENCE: How do you
make the simulations?

586
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,480
Would you essentially--
can you take

587
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,390
a sum over different Gillespie?

588
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,085
PROFESSOR: So it's
true that you can do

589
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,100
a sum over different Gillespie.

590
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,690
But we haven't yet
told you about,

591
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,760
what the Gillespie algorithm
is, so I can't use that.

592
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,250
But indeed, you can just
use a standard solver

593
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,740
of differential equations.

594
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,410
So whatever program
you use is going

595
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,445
to have some way of doing this.

596
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:30,320
And once you've written
down these equations,

597
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,903
the fact that these are actually
probabilities doesn't matter.

598
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:35,170
So those could have
been something else.

599
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:40,240
So this could be the number
of eggs, whatever, right?

600
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,115
So once you've
gotten the equations,

601
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,990
then equations just tell
you how the problems

602
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,176
are going to change over time.

603
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,628
Yeah.

604
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:51,336
AUDIENCE: Maybe this
is a silly question,

605
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:57,520
but in practice, do you have
to assume all the probabilities

606
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,940
are 0 above some number?

607
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,510
PROFESSOR: Oh no, that's not at
all a silly question, because--

608
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

609
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,271
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

610
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,510
Right.

611
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,020
And yes, it's a
very good question.

612
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,550
So I told you this is an
infinite set of differential

613
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,555
equations.

614
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,180
But at the same time I told you
this master equation's supposed

615
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,080
to be useful for something,
and kind of at the face of it,

616
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,560
these are incompatible ideas.

617
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,530
And the basic answer
is that you have

618
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,200
to include all the
states where there

619
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,195
is a sort of
non-negligible probability.

620
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:35,902

621
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,110
We could be concrete, though.

622
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,390
So let's imagine that I tell
you we want to look at the mRNA

623
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,120
number here.

624
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,550
And I tell you that
OK, Km is equal to--

625
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,540
well, let me make sure.

626
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,370
Gamma m.

627
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,240
What are typical lifetimes
of mRNAs in bacteria again?

628
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,292
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

629
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,000
PROFESSOR: Right.

630
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,790
Order a minute.

631
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:09,790
So that means that-- let's say
this is 0.5 minutes minus 1.

632
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,595
To get a lifetime
of around 2 minutes.

633
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:15,180

634
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,770
And then let's imagine that
this is then 50 per minute.

635
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,920

636
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,870
So an mRNA is kind of
made once a minute.

637
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,000
There's 50 of them.

638
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,604
That's a lot, but whatever.

639
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:30,520
There are a few genes.

640
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,850
Minute.

641
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,520
I wanted the number
to be something.

642
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,620
So there's a fair rate
of mRNA production.

643
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,970
Now how many
equations do you think

644
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,590
you might need to simulate?

645
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,997
So we'll think about this.

646
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:48,330
First of all, does it depend
upon the initial conditions

647
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:48,829
or not?

648
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:51,295

649
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:53,170
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

650
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

651
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,710
It does.

652
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,540
So be careful.

653
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:06,930
But let's say that I tell you
that we start with 50 mRNA.

654
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,620
The question is,
how many equations

655
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,370
do you think you might
have to write down?

656
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,041
And let's say we want to
understand this once it

657
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,290
gets to, say, the equilibrium.

658
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,320

659
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,820
All right.

660
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,695
Number of equations.

661
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:22,090

662
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,010
Give me a moment to come up
with some reasonable options.

663
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:45,430

664
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:57,790
Well, these are--
let's say that this

665
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,230
could show up on your homework.

666
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,490
So the question is,
how many equations

667
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,614
are you going to program
into your intersimulation?

668
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,170

669
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,810
And it may be-- doesn't have to
be exactly any of these number,

670
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,200
but order.

671
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,520

672
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,020
Do you guys understand
the question?

673
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,830

674
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,042
So we need a different
equation for each

675
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,000
of these probabilities.

676
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,940
So in principle we have--
the master equation

677
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,910
gives us an infinite
number of equations.

678
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,760
So we have d the probability
of having 0 mRNA with respect

679
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,170
to time.

680
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,620
That's going to be-- any idea
what this is going to be?

681
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,806

682
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:48,302
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

683
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:49,010
PROFESSOR: Right.

684
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,665
So we have a minus
Km times what?

685
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:57,840

686
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,980
Times p0, right.

687
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,710
So this is because if we
start out down here at P0.

688
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,602
Now we have Km.

689
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:09,185
So I was just about
to violate my rule

690
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:14,730
and just write down an equation
without drawing this thing.

691
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,084
So it's Km times p0.

692
00:34:16,084 --> 00:34:17,500
That's a way you
lose probability,

693
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,100
but you can also
gain probability

694
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:26,325
at a rate that goes
as gamma m times P1.

695
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:31,630

696
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,340
So that's how this probability
is going to change over time.

697
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,730
But we have a different equation
for you for p1, for p2, for p3,

698
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:44,060
for p4, all the way, in
principle, to p1,683,000,

699
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,949
bla bla bla, right?

700
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,150
So that's problematic,
because if we

701
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,860
have to actually in our program
code up 100,000,000 equations,

702
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,190
or it could be worse.

703
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,580
Then we're going have
trouble with our computers.

704
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,400
So you always have
to have some notion

705
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,790
of what you should be doing.

706
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,480
And this also highlights
that it's really important

707
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,290
to have some intuitive notion of
what's going on in your system

708
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,230
before you go and you
start programming,

709
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,507
because in that
case-- well, you're

710
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:18,340
likely to write down
something that's wrong.

711
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,173
You won't know if you
have the right answer,

712
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:23,580
and you might do something
that doesn't make any sense.

713
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,769
So you have to have
some notion of what

714
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,560
the system should look
like before you even

715
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,502
start coding it.

716
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,880

717
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,300
My question is, how
many of these equations

718
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,050
should we simulate?

719
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:50,590

720
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,994
OK.

721
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:53,160
Let's just see where we are.

722
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,659
Ready.

723
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,520
3, 2, 1.

724
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,300

725
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,800
OK.

726
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,190
So I'd say that we
have, it's basically

727
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,590
between C and D. Yeah.

728
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,770
I would say some people are
maybe more careful than I am.

729
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:15,000
Can one of the Ds maybe
defend why they're saying D?

730
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,195

731
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

732
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,120

733
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,370
PROFESSOR: The mean is 100,
and when you say-- I mean,

734
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,411
I think that whatever
you're thinking is correct,

735
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,780
but I think that the words
are a little dangerous.

736
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:40,280
And why am I concerned
about-- you said--

737
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
is the mean 100 for all time?

738
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,975

739
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,264
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and steady state.

740
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,430
PROFESSOR: And steady state.

741
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,929
Right.

742
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:54,430
I think that was the-- for long
times, the mean number of mRNA

743
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,170
will, indeed, be 100.

744
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,160
So the mean number
of m, in this case,

745
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,010
will be Km divided
by gamma m, which

746
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,980
is going to be equal
to 50 divided by that.

747
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,560
That gets us 100.

748
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,050
Now will it be exactly 100?

749
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,550
No.

750
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,216
It's going to be 100
plus or minus what?

751
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:16,570

752
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,890
Plus or minus 10.

753
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,490
Right.

754
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,462
Because this distribution
at steady state is what?

755
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:22,610
AUDIENCE: It's Poisson.

756
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,700
PROFESSOR: It's Poisson.

757
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,360
What's the variance of
a Poisson distribution?

758
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
It's equal to the mean.

759
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,330
So for Poisson, the variance
is equal to the mean.

760
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,380

761
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,230
Variance is the square of
the standard deviation,

762
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,480
which means that this is
going to be plus or minus 10.

763
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,800

764
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,180
That's kind of the typical
width of the distribution.

765
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,350
So what it means is
that at equilibrium,

766
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,780
we're going to be at 100 and
it's going to kind of look

767
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,380
like this.

768
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,270
So this might be 2 sigma,
so this could be 20.

769
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,850
But each of these is 10.

770
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,290

771
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,990
So if you want to
capture this, you

772
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,560
might want to go
out to a few sigma.

773
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,950

774
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,830
So let's say you want
to go out to 3 sigma,

775
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,663
then you might want to
get out to 130 maybe.

776
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,930

777
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,750
So then, if you want
to be more careful

778
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,510
you go out to 140 or 150.

779
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,510
But this thing is going
to decay exponentially,

780
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,920
so you don't need
to go up TO 1,000,

781
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,840
because the probability's
going to be 0 0 0.

782
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,690
Certain once you're at 200 you
don't have to worry about it.

783
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,290
But of course, you have to
remember the initial condition

784
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,260
we started at 50.

785
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,930

786
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,411
So we started at this point,
which means we definitely

787
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,660
have to include that equation.

788
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,990
Otherwise we're in trouble.

789
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,860
Now how much do we have
to go to below 50 Any--

790
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:04,132

791
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,090
AUDIENCE: My guess would be
that it would be not much

792
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,881
more than the [? few ?] times
5, because if it were already

793
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:13,464
at equilibrium that
would be the mean.

794
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,047
But it's not, and
so the driving force

795
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:17,141
is still going to push
it back to [INAUDIBLE].

796
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:18,140
PROFESSOR: That's right.

797
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,190
So it's going to
be a bias random

798
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,460
walk here, where it's
going to be sort of maybe

799
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,180
twice as likely at each step to
be moving right as to be moving

800
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,059
left.

801
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,850
That means it could
very well go to 49, 48.

802
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,249
But it's not really going
to go below 40, say.

803
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,040
Of course you have to
quantify these things

804
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,123
if you want to be careful.

805
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:38,540
But certainly I would say going
from, I don't know, 35 to 135

806
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,180
would be fine with me.

807
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,510
You would get full credit
on your problem set.

808
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,350
So we'll say-- I'm going to
make this up-- from 35 to 135,

809
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,900
134 just so it could
be 100 equations.

810
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,273
So I'd say I'd be fine
with 100 equations.

811
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:57,100

812
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,410
So you would simulate the
change in the probabilities

813
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:05,936
of P35 to P134, for example.

814
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,810
So although in principle,
the master equation

815
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,870
specifies how the probabilities
for an infinite number

816
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,519
of equations are
going to change,

817
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,560
you only need to simulate
a finite number of them

818
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,700
depending upon the
dynamics of your system.

819
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,250

820
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,100
Yes.

821
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,550
Thank you for the question,
because it's a very important

822
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,457
practical thing.

823
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:27,245
AUDIENCE: So in
practice, you don't

824
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:30,756
know what the solution is,
which is sort of why you would

825
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:31,256
[INAUDIBLE].

826
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:35,210
Do you explain your range and
see if the solution changes?

827
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,350
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, in this case,

828
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,766
it's a little bit cheating
because we already kind of knew

829
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:40,980
the answer.

830
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,370
We didn't know exactly
how the time dependence

831
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,410
was going to go.

832
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,076
How is it that the mean is going
to change over time on average?

833
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:50,905

834
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:51,780
Exponentially, right?

835
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,430
So on average you
will start at 50.

836
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,990
You exponentially relax to 100.

837
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,280
But in many cases, we don't
know so much about the system.

838
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,310
And I'd say that what,
in general, you can do

839
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,060
is, you have to always specify
a finite number of equations.

840
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,210
But then what you can do
is, you can put in, like,

841
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,040
reflecting boundary
conditions or so on the end,

842
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,399
so you don't allow
probability to escape.

843
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,690
But then what you can do is
you can run the simulation,

844
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,596
and if you have some
reasonable probability to any

845
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:19,720
of your boundaries, then
you know you're in trouble

846
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,320
and you have to
extend it from there.

847
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,720
So you can look to
say, oh, is it above 10

848
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,067
to the minus 3 or 4, whatever.

849
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,400
And then if it is, then you
know you have to go further.

850
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,742

851
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,700
Any other questions about
how-- you're actually

852
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,949
going to be doing
simulations of this, so these

853
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:40,240
are relevant questions for you.

854
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,880

855
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,380
All right.

856
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,880

857
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,490
So that's the master equation.

858
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,870
But I'd say the key,
key thing to remember

859
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,360
is that it tells
you how to calculate

860
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,070
the deterministic evolution of
the probability of these states

861
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,300
given some potentially
complicated set

862
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,580
of interactions.

863
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,060
Now, a rather orthogonal
view to the master equation

864
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,080
is to use the
Gillespie algorithm,

865
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,486
or in general, to do direct
stochastic simulations

866
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,610
of individual trajectories.

867
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,110
Yeah.

868
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,890
Question before we go.

869
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,300
AUDIENCE: So if we just set
it to 0, the probabilities

870
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,264
outside the range
we think we need,

871
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:24,710
would we be losing probability?

872
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,905

873
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:29,030
PROFESSOR: So the question
is whether we're somehow

874
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,821
losing probability.

875
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:33,110
So what I was proposing
before is that you always

876
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,640
want probabilities to sum to 1.

877
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,730
Otherwise it's not
our probability

878
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,690
and the mathematicians
get upset.

879
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,310
And the key thing
there is that you

880
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,380
want to start with-- you have
to include all the states that

881
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,050
have probability
at the beginning.

882
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,462
So in that sense, you're
given an initial distribution,

883
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:56,170
and you have to include
all those states.

884
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,896
Otherwise you're definitely
going to do something funny.

885
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:01,270
You start out with a normalized
probability distribution.

886
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,390
And then I guess
what I was proposing

887
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,570
is that you have a finite
number of equations,

888
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,870
but you don't let
the probability leave

889
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,280
or come in from those ends.

890
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,010
And if you do that,
then you will always

891
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,470
have a normalized
probability distribution.

892
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,340
Of course, at the
ends you've kind of

893
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,434
violated the actual
equations, and that's

894
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,850
why you have to
make sure that you

895
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,700
don't have significant
probability at any

896
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,440
of your boundaries.

897
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,890
Does that answer?

898
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,390
Not quite?

899
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,348
AUDIENCE: Because I'm
wondering if [INAUDIBLE].

900
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:37,112

901
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:39,070
PROFESSOR: So I was not
suggesting that you set

902
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,630
the probabilities equal to 0.

903
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,114
I was suggesting that you
do what's kind of like what

904
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:45,280
the equations actually here,
which is that you don't

905
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,920
allow any probability to leave.

906
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,540
There's no probably
flux on this edge.

907
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,780
So for example, out at P134,
I would just say, OK, well,

908
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,500
here's the probability
that you have 134 mRNA.

909
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,350
And in principle there
are these two arrows,

910
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,580
but you can just
get rid of them.

911
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,900
So now any probability that
enters here can only come back.

912
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,750
And I've somehow
violated my equations.

913
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,020
But if P134 is essentially
0, then it doesn't matter.

914
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:22,120

915
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,880
So instead of looking at these
probabilities evolve kind of as

916
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,520
a whole, we can instead look at
individual trajectories, right?

917
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,210
So the idea here is that if
we start with the situation--

918
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,492
actually, we can
take this thing here.

919
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:41,700
So we know that at steady
state it's going to be 100.

920
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,180
Starts out at 50.

921
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,560
And in this case, with the
master equation you say,

922
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,060
OK, well, you start out with
all the probability right here.

923
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,734
So you have kind of a
delta function at 50.

924
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,900
But then what happens is
this thing kind of evolves,

925
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:59,442
and over time this
thing kind of spreads

926
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:00,900
until you have
something that looks

927
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,690
like this, where you have a
Poisson distribution centered

928
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,959
around 100.

929
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:08,500
And this Poisson
distribution's going

930
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,060
to be very close to a
Gaussian, because you

931
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,680
have a significant number.

932
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,888
So the master equation tells
you how this probability

933
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:16,610
distribution evolves.

934
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:23,440
Now this is the number m and
this is kind of the frequency

935
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,330
that you observe it.

936
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,910
So we can also
kind of flip things

937
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:34,310
so we instead plot the
number m on the y-axis.

938
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:38,347
And we already said the
deterministic equations

939
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:39,180
will look like this.

940
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,585
And the characteristic time
scale for this is what?

941
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:49,670

942
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,590
1 over mm, right?

943
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,230
So this thing relaxes
to the equilibrium,

944
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,840
time scale determined by the
degradation time of the mRNA.

945
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,270
So these are things
that should be really--

946
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,145
you want to be kind of
drilled into your head,

947
00:46:03,145 --> 00:46:05,790
and I'm trying to drill,
so you'll hear them again

948
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,110
and again.

949
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,880
Now the master equation, indeed,
since everything's linear here,

950
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,970
the expectation value over
the probability distributions

951
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,821
actually does behave like this.

952
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:19,070
So the mean of the distributions
as a function of time

953
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,600
look like that.

954
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,710
And in some ways, if
we were to plot this,

955
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,550
we would say, OK, well,
first of all it's all here.

956
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,180
Then it kind of looks like this.

957
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,640
So this is somehow how those
probability distributions are

958
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,390
kind of expanding over time.

959
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,120
Now for an individual
trajectories,

960
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,314
if we run a bunch of
stochastic simulations,

961
00:46:38,314 --> 00:46:40,480
we'll get something that
on average looks like this,

962
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,440
but it might look like this.

963
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,010
A different one might
look like this, and so on,

964
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,860
although they shouldn't
converge there

965
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,630
because that's not consistent.

966
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,420
And if you did a histogram
at all those different times

967
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,170
of the individual
stochastic trajectories,

968
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,259
you should recover the
probability distribution

969
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:03,800
that you got for
the master equation.

970
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,480

971
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,860
So this is a powerful
way just to make sure

972
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,330
that, for example, your
simulations are working,

973
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,150
that you can check to make
sure that everything behaves

974
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,869
in a consistent way.

975
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:18,410
Now there's a major
question, though,

976
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,020
of how is it that
you should generate

977
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,550
these stochastic trajectories?

978
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,150
And the sort of most
straightforward thing to do

979
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,230
is to just divide up time into
a bunch of little delta t's,

980
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,450
and just ask whether
anything happened.

981
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,380
So let me--

982
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:47,080

983
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:54,870
So what we want to do is we
want to imagine we have maybe

984
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,400
m chemical species.

985
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,390
So now these are
different m's and n's.

986
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,930
Be careful.

987
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,030
m chemical species, they could
be anything, could be proteins,

988
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,400
they could be small
molecules, something.

989
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,690
And there are n
possible reactions.

990
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,630
And indeed, in some
cases people want

991
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,770
to study the stochastic
dynamics of large networks.

992
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,500
So you could have
50 chemical species

993
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,665
and 300 different reactions.

994
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:25,165
So this could be
rather complicated.

995
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:27,820

996
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:34,080
And these m chemical species
have, we'll say, numbers

997
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,030
or if you'd like, in some cases
it could be concentrations, Xi,

998
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:44,140
so then the whole thing can
be described as some vector X.

999
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,740
And the question is, how
should we assimilate this?

1000
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,890
The so-called, what we often
call the naive protocol--

1001
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,500
and this is indeed what
I did in graduate school

1002
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,400
because nobody told me that
I wasn't supposed to do it--

1003
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,170
is that you divide time into
little time segments delta t.

1004
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:09,550

1005
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,422
Small delta t.

1006
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:11,880
And you just do
this over and over.

1007
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,440
And for each delta t you
ask, did anything happen?

1008
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,130
If it did, then you update.

1009
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,450
If not, you keep on going.

1010
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,216
Now the problem with
this approach-- well,

1011
00:49:23,216 --> 00:49:24,841
what is the problem
with this approach?

1012
00:49:24,841 --> 00:49:29,170

1013
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1014
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:31,890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1015
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,830
Time is continuous.

1016
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:39,050
So one problem is that, well,
you don't like discrete time.

1017
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,820
That's understandable.

1018
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,470
But I'm going to say, well, you
know, the details-- a delta t

1019
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,360
may be small, so
you won't notice.

1020
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,140

1021
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,181
I'm saying, if I said
delta t being small,

1022
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:55,680
then I'm going to claim that
you're not going to notice that

1023
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,704
I've--

1024
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:57,880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1025
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,310
PROFESSOR: But then the
simulation is slow, right?

1026
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,080
So there's a fundamental
trade-off here.

1027
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,500
And in particular, the
problem with this protocol

1028
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,070
is that for it to
behave reasonably,

1029
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,070
delta t has to be very small.

1030
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,610
And what do I mean by
very small, though?

1031
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:18,222

1032
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,097
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1033
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:25,090

1034
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1035
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:33,210
For this to work,
delta t has to be

1036
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,403
such that unlikely for
anything to happen.

1037
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:41,599

1038
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,390
But this is already a
problem, because that

1039
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,570
means that we're doing
a lot of simulations,

1040
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,510
and then just
nothing's happening.

1041
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,420

1042
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,710
How do we figure out
what that probability is?

1043
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:03,680

1044
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,600
So in particular, we
can ask about-- well,

1045
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:15,370
given possible reactions,
we'll say with rates rs of i.

1046
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:22,140
So the probability that the i'th
reaction occurs is equal to r i

1047
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:30,600
times delta t for small delta t,
because each of these reactions

1048
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,270
will occur kind of at a rate--
they're going to be exponential

1049
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,330
distributions of the
times for them to occur.

1050
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,440
This is a Poisson process
because it's random.

1051
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,960
Now what we want to know is
the probability that nothing

1052
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,457
is going to happen
because that's how we're

1053
00:51:49,457 --> 00:51:50,540
going to have set delta t.

1054
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,680

1055
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,460
Well, what we can
imagine is, then

1056
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,670
we say, well, what's the
probability that is, say,

1057
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:10,870
not reaction 1 and
not 2 and dot dot dot.

1058
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,500
OK.

1059
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,846
Well, and this is in
some time delta t.

1060
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:20,050

1061
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:25,475
Well, actually, we know that
if the fundamental process just

1062
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,850
looks like this,
then we're going

1063
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,975
to get exponential
distributions for each of those.

1064
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:32,170

1065
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:36,450
So we end up with e
to the r1, and indeed,

1066
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,330
once we write an exponential,
we don't have to write delta t.

1067
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,580
This is just some time t.

1068
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,830
For this to be true requires
a delta t is very small.

1069
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,060
But if we want to
just ask, what's

1070
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,360
the probability that reaction
1 has not happened in some time

1071
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,260
t, this actually is,
indeed, precisely equal

1072
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,060
to e to the r1t.

1073
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:00,400

1074
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,983
Yeah, details.

1075
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:06,080

1076
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,890
And this is e to the minus
r2t dot dot dot minus.

1077
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,375
And we go up to n, r to the nt,
because each of those chemical

1078
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,500
reactions are going to be
exponentially distributed

1079
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,875
in terms of how long you have
to wait for them to happen.

1080
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:26,090

1081
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,870
And what's neat about
this is that this means

1082
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,440
that if you just ask
about the probability

1083
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,450
distribution for all of them
combined by saying that none

1084
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,130
of them have happened,
this is actually

1085
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,920
just equal to the
exponent of minus--

1086
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,850
now we might pull the t out
and we just sum over ri.

1087
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:54,130

1088
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,880
So this is actually, somehow,
a little bit surprising,

1089
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,300
which is that each of
those chemical reactions

1090
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,300
occur, and they're occurring
at different rates.

1091
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,591
Some of them might be fast,
some of them might be slow.

1092
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:08,470
The ri's can be different
by orders of magnitude.

1093
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,334
But still, over these hundreds
of chemical reactions,

1094
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:12,750
if the only thing
you want to know

1095
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,750
is, oh, what's the
probability that none of them

1096
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,150
have happened,
that is also going

1097
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,625
to end up-- that's going
to decay exponentially.

1098
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,880

1099
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,130
And this actually tells us
something very interesting,

1100
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,470
which is that if we want to
know the distribution of times

1101
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,429
for the first thing
to happen, that's

1102
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:31,220
also going to be
exponentially distributed.

1103
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,295

1104
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:35,920
And it's just
exponentially distributed

1105
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,980
with a rate that is given
by the sum of these rates.

1106
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,720
Now that's the
basic insight behind

1107
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,560
this GIllespie algorithm, where
instead of dividing things up

1108
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,920
into a bunch of little times
delta t, instead what you do

1109
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,200
is you ask, how long am
I going to have to wait

1110
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,480
before the first thing happens?

1111
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,899
And you just sample from an
exponential with this rate

1112
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,190
r that is the sum of the rates.

1113
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:11,827

1114
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:13,410
Maybe it's even worth
saying that, OK,

1115
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,450
so there's the naive
algorithm where you just

1116
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,610
divide a bunch of delta t's,
you just take a little steps,

1117
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,320
you say, OK, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, and then

1118
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,420
eventually something
happens, and then

1119
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,030
you update, you keep on going.

1120
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:27,390
There's the somewhat less naive
algorithm, which is exact,

1121
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,610
so it's not the same
concerns, the j hat which

1122
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:34,840
is that you could just sample
from n different exponentials,

1123
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,400
each with their
own rates, and then

1124
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,800
just take the minimum
of them and say, OK,

1125
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,420
that's the that happened first,
and then update from that.

1126
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,310
And that's an exact algorithm.

1127
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,480
But the problem is that you
have to sample from possibly

1128
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,790
many different exponentials.

1129
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,890
And that's not a
disaster, but again, it's

1130
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,000
computationally slow.

1131
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,580
So the Gillespie algorithm
removes the requirement

1132
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,470
to from those n exponentials,
because instead what you

1133
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:05,780
do is you just say, the
numbers, or the concentrations,

1134
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:13,465
give all of the ri,
give you all the rates.

1135
00:56:13,465 --> 00:56:21,290

1136
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,640
And then what you
do is you sample

1137
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:34,120
from an exponential
with rate r, which

1138
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,770
is the sum over all the ri.

1139
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,520
That tells you, when is the
first reaction going to occur.

1140
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,020

1141
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,450
And then what you do is you ask,
well, which reaction did occur?

1142
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:51,990
Because you actually
don't know that yet.

1143
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,180
And there, it's just the
probabilities of each of them.

1144
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,530
So the probabilities
Pi is just going

1145
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:06,440
to be the ri divided by the
sum over the ri, so this big R.

1146
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,150
So it may be that you had 300
possible chemical reactions,

1147
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,030
but you only have to
do two things here.

1148
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,020
And they're both kind
of simple, right?

1149
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,950
You sample from one
exponential, gives you

1150
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,680
how long you had to wait
for something to happen.

1151
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,165
And then you just sample from
another simple probability

1152
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:24,600
thing here that just
tells you which of the n

1153
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,400
possible chemical reactions
was it that actually occurred.

1154
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,340
And of course, the
chemical reactions

1155
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,900
that were occurring
at a faster rate

1156
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,560
have a higher probability
of being chosen.

1157
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,370
So this actually is an
exact procedure in the sense

1158
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:43,340
that there's no digitization of
time or anything of the sort.

1159
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:47,330
So this actually is
computationally efficient

1160
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:52,080
and is exact, assuming that
your description of the chemical

1161
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,459
reactions was accurate
to begin with.

1162
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,000
So then what we do
is we update time.

1163
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,820

1164
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,880
This is in some ways--
when you do computations,

1165
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,880
when you actually do
simulations-- this is maybe

1166
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,240
the annoying part about the
Gillespie algorithm, which

1167
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,800
is that now your times
are not equally spaced,

1168
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,420
and so then you
just have to make

1169
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,190
sure you remember that, you
don't plot something that's

1170
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,150
incorrect.

1171
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:21,250
Because your times are going
to hop at different time

1172
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,700
intervals.

1173
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,846
But that's doable.

1174
00:58:23,846 --> 00:58:25,346
You have to update
your time and you

1175
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:29,300
have to update your abundances.

1176
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,380
And then what you do is repeat.

1177
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,751

1178
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,250
I think the notes kind of allude
to this Gillespie algorithm

1179
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,790
but are not quite explicit
about what you actually

1180
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,274
do to go through this process.

1181
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,690
For the simulations that you're
going to do in this class,

1182
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:54,785
I would say that you don't
get the full benefits

1183
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:56,660
of the Gillespie in the
sense that you're not

1184
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,540
going to be simulating hundreds
of differential equations

1185
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,820
with hundreds of
different things.

1186
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,820
But it's in those
complicated models

1187
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,470
that you really have to do this
kind of Gillespie approach,

1188
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:10,769
as compared to even this
somewhat better model, which is

1189
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:12,560
you sample from the
different exponentials.

1190
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,187

1191
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:18,270
Are there any questions
about why this might work,

1192
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,240
why you might want to do it?

1193
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:20,990
Yes.

1194
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,930
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
by sample the exponentials?

1195
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,000
PROFESSOR: Right.

1196
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,670
What I mean is that you
go to Matlab and you say,

1197
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:40,730
random-- I'm sort of
serious, but-- sorry,

1198
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,270
I'm trying to get
a new-- All right.

1199
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,170
So you the exponential.

1200
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,460
So it's a probability
distribution.

1201
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:56,530
So this is the probability is
a function of time and then t.

1202
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,902
And it's going to look
something like this.

1203
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:01,500

1204
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,840
This thing is going to be some--
given that, in general, it's

1205
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:13,750
going to be the probability t is
going to be e to the minus rt.

1206
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,878
And then do I put r here
or do I put 1 over r?

1207
01:00:16,878 --> 01:00:18,699
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1208
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,782
PROFESSOR: Is it 1 over r?

1209
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,820

1210
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,520
Well, what should be the units
of a probability distribution?

1211
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,300

1212
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,400
1 over time, in this case.

1213
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,120
It's 1 over whatever's
on this x-axis,

1214
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,740
because if you want to get
the actual, honest to goodness

1215
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,820
probability-- so if you want
the probability that t is,

1216
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:50,864
say, between t1 and
t1 plus delta t.

1217
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,280
If you want an
actual probability,

1218
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:59,090
then this thing is equal to
the probability density at t1,

1219
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:02,170
in this case, times delta t.

1220
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:06,240

1221
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,530
So that means thing has
to have a 1 over time,

1222
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,931
and that gives us r here.

1223
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:14,960

1224
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,800
So this is probability
density, and what

1225
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,700
I'm saying is that when I say
sample from this probability

1226
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,470
distribution, what it means is
that it's like rolling a die,

1227
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,340
but that it's a biased
die because it's

1228
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,460
continuous thing over the time.

1229
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,380
But just like when you have a
six-sided die and I say, OK,

1230
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,450
sample from the die,
you're playing Monopoly,

1231
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,350
you throw the die and
you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1232
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,114
And you do that
over and over again.

1233
01:01:39,114 --> 01:01:39,780
Same thing here.

1234
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,040
You kind of roll the die
and see what happens.

1235
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,720
And indeed, you're going to get
some practice with probability

1236
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,010
distributions on the
homework that you're

1237
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:52,910
doing right now because you're
asked to demonstrate that you

1238
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,855
can sample from a uniform
distribution, which something

1239
01:01:55,855 --> 01:01:59,430
that's just equally probable
across the unit line,

1240
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:03,080
and do a transformation and get
an exponential distribution.

1241
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,710
And it used to be that
everybody knew all these tricks

1242
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:07,260
because you had to
kind of know them

1243
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,280
in order to do computation.

1244
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,199
But now, Matlab, or
whatever program you use,

1245
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:13,740
they know all the
tricks, so you just

1246
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,005
ask it to sample from an
exponential with this property

1247
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:17,999
and it does it for you.

1248
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:19,790
But you still need to
know what it's doing.

1249
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:23,100

1250
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,390
So just to be clear, what
is the most likely time

1251
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,473
that you're going to get
out from the exponential?

1252
01:02:29,473 --> 01:02:32,790

1253
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,720
0.

1254
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,750
It has a peak here but
the mean is over here.

1255
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:44,190

1256
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,815
Any other questions about how
the Gillespie algorithm works?

1257
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:54,370

1258
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:59,370
Can somebody tell me how
a protein burst arises?

1259
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,605
So we had this original
question about whether there

1260
01:03:01,605 --> 01:03:03,000
were protein bursts
in that model

1261
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,520
that I wrote down, where we
just had m dot is equal to--

1262
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:18,840

1263
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:24,610
Now what we said was that the
master equation would not--

1264
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,280
the protein burst
would somehow be

1265
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,950
there are but you
would never see them,

1266
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,131
or somehow the protein burst
would influence how the mean

1267
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:34,380
and everything have evolved,
but you wouldn't actually

1268
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,510
see any big jumps.

1269
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,051
But then we said, oh, but if
you did a stochastic simulation,

1270
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:38,900
you would.

1271
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,910
So the claim here is that
the Gillespie algorithm,

1272
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,975
what I've just told you here,
will lead to protein bursts.

1273
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:47,500

1274
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,055
When I make that statement,
what is it that I actually mean?

1275
01:03:50,055 --> 01:03:54,910

1276
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:57,610
If we do a Gillespie
of this, will the-- OK,

1277
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,590
let's just hold on.

1278
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,360
Let me do a quick vote.

1279
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:07,757
Will we have cases where
delta n is greater than 1?

1280
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:10,090
If I go through this process,
if I'm using the Gillespie

1281
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,240
and I'm tracking how mRNA and
protein number are changing

1282
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,980
over time, will I get these
things, protein bursts,

1283
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,775
where delta n is larger than
1 in one of these time cycles?

1284
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:28,460

1285
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:29,010
Ready?

1286
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,270
3, 2, 1.

1287
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:36,510

1288
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,580
So most of the group is saying
that it's going to be no.

1289
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,770
But again, it's mixed.

1290
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:47,760
So can somebody say
why we don't get--

1291
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] It
seems like the structure

1292
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,760
of the simulation is to
make sure [INAUDIBLE].

1293
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,760
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1294
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,260
Yeah.

1295
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,920
So the simulation
as written-- you

1296
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,547
could imagine some sort of
phenomenological version

1297
01:05:02,547 --> 01:05:04,880
of this where you allowed,
actually, for protein bursts.

1298
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,300
But as kind of specified
is that we ask,

1299
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,080
what's the time for
one thing to happen?

1300
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,870

1301
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,110
But the claim somehow is,
OK, well, we can still

1302
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,540
get protein bursts from this.

1303
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,396
And how does that happen?

1304
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:24,284

1305
01:05:24,284 --> 01:05:27,200
AUDIENCE: You can have the
rate for something happening

1306
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,475
increase suddenly, and that
would happen if we go from m

1307
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:34,604
equals 0 to m equals 1--

1308
01:05:34,604 --> 01:05:37,480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for example,
if we didn't have an mRNA before

1309
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,610
and we got an mRNA.

1310
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,340
What it means that
if you look at n

1311
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,820
as a function of time
during one of these protein

1312
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,462
bursts-- before, I was drawing
it just hopping up, but really,

1313
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:48,920
in the context of
the Gillespie, it

1314
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,175
would be that it would hop, hop.

1315
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,850
So there would be
little time jumps.

1316
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,370

1317
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:58,880
So this is a protein
burst, but it's really

1318
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,210
before this mRNA is
degraded, you get 1, 1, 1, 1.

1319
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:05,800
So each of these
as is delta n of 1.

1320
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,170
So this is whatever, 6, 7.

1321
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:12,680
And then what can happen is
that we get the mRNA degraded.

1322
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,997
And so then we're going
to get a slower thing

1323
01:06:14,997 --> 01:06:22,060
where it-- looks like that.

1324
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,720
So the Gillespie, everything
is being created and destroyed

1325
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,740
in units of 1.

1326
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,024
But it could be that the
time interval over this burst

1327
01:06:30,024 --> 01:06:32,190
is just very short, so then
it goes up very quickly,

1328
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,580
but then it's slower to go away.

1329
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:39,001

1330
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:41,000
So what I want to do in
just the last 15 minutes

1331
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,380
is talk a bit about the
Fokker-Planck approximation.

1332
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:47,650
I would say that all these
different approaches are

1333
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,470
useful to varying degrees
in terms of actually doing

1334
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,930
simulations, doing
analytic calculations,

1335
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,050
getting intuition.

1336
01:06:55,050 --> 01:07:00,284
And the Fokker-Planck
approach, I'd say it's

1337
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:01,950
more or less useful
for different people

1338
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,890
depending on what you're doing.

1339
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,750
So the basic idea,
as kind of you

1340
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,410
answered in the
pre-class reading,

1341
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,696
is that in cases where
n is large enough

1342
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,070
that you don't
feel like you need

1343
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,870
to take into account
the discrete nature

1344
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,207
of the molecules,
yet at the same time

1345
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:20,790
it's not so large
that you can totally

1346
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,670
ignore the fluctuations, then
the Fokker-Planck approach

1347
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:27,030
is nice because it allows you
to get some sense of what's

1348
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,490
going on without all of the
crazy details of, for example,

1349
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:34,540
the master equation.

1350
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,130
And then it also,
because of this idea

1351
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,830
of an effective
potential, it allows

1352
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,790
you to bring all the intuition
from that into your study

1353
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,780
of these gene circuits.

1354
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,580
Now I'm not going to go
through the whole derivation,

1355
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,180
but if you have
questions about that,

1356
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,270
please come up
after class and I'm

1357
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:54,930
happy to go through it with
you, because it's sort of fun.

1358
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,620

1359
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,490
But the notes do go over it.

1360
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,930
I think that's what's perhaps
useful to just remind ourselves

1361
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:11,020
of is how it maybe leads to
a Gaussian with some width

1362
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,890
depending upon the shapes of the
production degradation curves.

1363
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:21,520

1364
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,090
So the basic notion
here is that, depending

1365
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:29,090
on the f's and g's, the
production degradation terms,

1366
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,644
we get different shaped
effective potentials.

1367
01:08:31,644 --> 01:08:41,671

1368
01:08:41,671 --> 01:08:43,170
So in general we
have something that

1369
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:46,020
looks like-- we have some
n dot, there's some fn,

1370
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,250
and then there's a minus gn.

1371
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:53,956
So for example, for something
that is just simple expression,

1372
01:08:53,956 --> 01:08:55,580
in the case of--
let's just imagine now

1373
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:58,424
that there is-- if you want we
can say it's a protein where

1374
01:08:58,424 --> 01:09:02,310
it's just some k minus gamma n.

1375
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:04,800
Or if you'd like, we could
say, oh, this is mRNA number.

1376
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,475
But something that's just
simple production, and then

1377
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,475
first order degradation.

1378
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:12,229

1379
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:16,120
The question is, how do
we go about understanding

1380
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,790
this in the context of the
Fokker-Planck approximation?

1381
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,550
And it turns out
that you can write it

1382
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:26,220
in what is essentially a
diffusion equation where

1383
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,140
you have some probability
flux that's moving around.

1384
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,000
And within that
realm, you can write

1385
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,380
that the probability
distribution of the number

1386
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,210
is going to be something
that-- so there's

1387
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,700
going to be some constant.

1388
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,140
There's f plus g.

1389
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,109
And these are both
functions of n.

1390
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:49,000
And then you have e to
the minus [INAUDIBLE]

1391
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,554
So the idea here is
that this behaves

1392
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:53,720
as some effective potential.

1393
01:09:53,720 --> 01:10:02,370

1394
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:05,860
Of course, it's not quite
true because f and g also

1395
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,680
are functions of n,
they're are not in here.

1396
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,600
But this is the dominant
term because it's

1397
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,391
in the exponential.

1398
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:13,770

1399
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:18,770
And here phi n is
defined as the following.

1400
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:23,400
So it's minus this integral
over n of the f minus g

1401
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:29,370
and f plus g dn that we
integrate over n prime.

1402
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,980

1403
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,800
And we're going to
kind of go through what

1404
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,508
some of these different
f's and g's might

1405
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,730
look like to try to get a
sense of why this happened.

1406
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:40,560
It is worth mentioning
that you can

1407
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,900
do this for any f and g when
it's just in one dimension,

1408
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,010
so you just have n.

1409
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,559
Once you have it
in two dimensions,

1410
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:52,350
so once you actually
have mRNA and protein,

1411
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,200
for example, you're
not guaranteed

1412
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,960
to to be able to write it
as an effective potential.

1413
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,040
Although I guess if you're
willing to invoke a vector

1414
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,770
potential, then maybe you can.

1415
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,190
But in terms of just
a simple potential,

1416
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:11,110
then you can do it one
dimension, but not necessarily

1417
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:11,610
in more.

1418
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:16,320

1419
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,930
And I think that, in general,
our intuition is not as useful

1420
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,630
when you have the equivalent
of magnetic fields and so forth

1421
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,070
here anyway.

1422
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:27,280
What I want to do is
just try to understand

1423
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:33,370
why this thing looks the way it
does for this simple regulation

1424
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:34,260
case.

1425
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,560
And then we're going to ask if
we change one thing or another,

1426
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,675
how does it affect the
resulting variance.

1427
01:11:41,675 --> 01:11:55,940

1428
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:02,210
So for unregulated
expression, such as here,

1429
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:08,180
if we look at the production and
degradation as a function of n,

1430
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:15,380
fn is just some constant
k, whereas gn is

1431
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,230
a line that goes up as gamma n.

1432
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:22,430

1433
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:28,560
Now in this situation, if you
do this integral-- and really,

1434
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,750
what you can imagine is what
this integral looks like right

1435
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:35,160
around that steady
state, because that's

1436
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,660
kind of what we want to know,
if we want to something about,

1437
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:40,630
for example, the width
of a distribution.

1438
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,740
Well, there's going
to b e two terms.

1439
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,810
In the numerator
there's an f minus g.

1440
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:48,520
In the denominator
there's an f plus g.

1441
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,450
Now f minus g is
actually equal to 0 right

1442
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:54,050
at that steady
state, and that's why

1443
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:57,000
it's a steady state, because
production and degradation are

1444
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,440
equal.

1445
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,282
Now as you go away from
that location, what you're

1446
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:04,615
doing is you're integrating
the difference between the f

1447
01:13:04,615 --> 01:13:06,130
and the g.

1448
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,000
And you can see that around
here these things are

1449
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,080
separating kind of-- well,
everything's a line here.

1450
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,630
And indeed, even if f
and g were not linear,

1451
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:20,794
close to that steady state
they would be linear.

1452
01:13:20,794 --> 01:13:22,710
What we can see is that
as you're integrating,

1453
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:24,168
you're integrating
across something

1454
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:26,149
that is growing linearly.

1455
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,565
That's what gives
you a quadratic.

1456
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:31,010

1457
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,090
And that's why this
effect of potential

1458
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:39,800
ends up behaving as if
you're in a quadratic trap.

1459
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,090
Now I encourage you to go
ahead and do that integral

1460
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:42,800
at some point.

1461
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,690
I was planning on
doing it for you today,

1462
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,120
but we are running out of time.

1463
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,176
Once again, I'm happy to
do it, just after class.

1464
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,800
And indeed, what you can see is
that because you're integrating

1465
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,180
across here, you end up
getting a quadratic increase

1466
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,630
in the effective potential.

1467
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,880
And if you look at what the
variance of that thing is,

1468
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,170
you indeed find that the
variance is equal to the mean

1469
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:02,670
here.

1470
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:07,380

1471
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,670
So what I want to ask
in terms of trying

1472
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:11,660
to get intuition
is, what happens

1473
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,700
if we pull these curves down?

1474
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,340

1475
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,450
So in particular,
let's imagine that we

1476
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:22,200
have a situation
where-- I'm going

1477
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,950
to re-parameterize
things, so again, we're

1478
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:29,172
kind of keeping the number
of the equilibrium constant.

1479
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:30,630
But now what I'm
going to do is I'm

1480
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,783
going to have an fn
that looks like this,

1481
01:14:32,783 --> 01:14:38,840
and gn looks like-- now gn is
going to be some 1/2 of lambda,

1482
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,287
and this fn is equal to
k minus 1/2 of gamma n.

1483
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:49,780

1484
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,754
Now the question is,
in this situation,

1485
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,420
what will be the
variance over the mean?

1486
01:14:54,420 --> 01:15:01,790

1487
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,960
Well, first of all, the
variance over the mean

1488
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,000
here was equal to what?

1489
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,190

1490
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,540
Although should we do vote?

1491
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:18,574

1492
01:15:18,574 --> 01:15:19,990
Here are going to
be some options.

1493
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:36,920

1494
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,411
Question is variance over
the mean in this situation.

1495
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:47,109

1496
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,900
I'm worried that this
is not going to work,

1497
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,410
but let's just see where are.

1498
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,170
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

1499
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:56,211

1500
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:56,710
All right.

1501
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,887
So I'd say that at
least broadly, people

1502
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:01,720
are agreeing that the
variance over the mean

1503
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,511
here is equal to 1.

1504
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:04,770
And again, this is the
situation that we've

1505
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:07,370
analyzed many times, which
is that in this situation

1506
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:10,540
we get a poisson,
where the poisson only

1507
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:14,190
has one free parameter, and
that parameter specifies

1508
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,911
both the mean and the variance.

1509
01:16:16,911 --> 01:16:18,660
So for a poisson, the
variance of the mean

1510
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,550
is indeed equal to 1.

1511
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:23,620
So the Fokker-Planck
approximation actually

1512
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,170
accurately recapitulates that.

1513
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,986

1514
01:16:27,986 --> 01:16:30,360
Now the question is, what will
the variance over the mean

1515
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,060
be in the situation that
I've just drawn here?

1516
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,510
So I'm going to
give you a minute

1517
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,720
to try to think about
what this means.

1518
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,100
And there are multiple
ways of figuring it out.

1519
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,080
You can look at,
maybe, the integral.

1520
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,250
You can think about the
biological intuition

1521
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:50,630
to make at least a guess
of of what it should do.

1522
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:53,990
The question is,
if the production

1523
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,930
rate and the degradation
rate look like this,

1524
01:16:55,930 --> 01:17:00,526
what does that mean for
the variance over the mean?

1525
01:17:00,526 --> 01:17:02,609
So I'll give you a minute
to kind of play with it.

1526
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:56,005

1527
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,505
Why don't we go
ahead and vote, just

1528
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,380
so I can get a sense
of where we are?

1529
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,540
And also, it's OK if you
can't actually figure this out

1530
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,520
or you're confused.

1531
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,930
But go ahead and make
your best guess anyways,

1532
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,781
because it's also
useful if you can guess

1533
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:11,280
kind of the direction it'll go,
even if you can't figure out

1534
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,520
its magnitude.

1535
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,500
So let's vote.

1536
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,260
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

1537
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:18,760
OK.

1538
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:24,430
So it's a mixture now,
I'd say, of A, B, C, Ds.

1539
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:27,740

1540
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:32,860
Yeah, I think this is, I
think, hard and confusing.

1541
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:42,180
I maybe won't have-- all right.

1542
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,260
I'll maybe say something.

1543
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,860
It may be that talking to each
other won't help that much.

1544
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,140
OK, so in this case,
what's relevant

1545
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:54,740
is both the f minus
g and the f plus g.

1546
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,190
And it turns out that f minus g
actually behaves the same way,

1547
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,380
because at the fixed point,
or at the equilibrium,

1548
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,940
it starts at 0 and then it
actually grows in the same way

1549
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,310
as you go away from it.

1550
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:09,410
The difference is the f plus
g, where that's very much not

1551
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,860
equal to 0.

1552
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:14,920
And f plus g at the
equilibrium, this f plus g

1553
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:21,710
here is around 2k, whereas f
plus g over here is around 1k.

1554
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:24,540

1555
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,230
What that means is
that in both cases

1556
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,180
you have a quadratic potential.

1557
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,990
But here the quadratic potential
actually ends up being steeper.

1558
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,010
So if this were
unregulated, then over here

1559
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:40,970
we still get a quadratic,
but it's with steeper walls.

1560
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:45,221
So actually here, this,
the variance over the mean,

1561
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:45,970
ends up being 1/2.

1562
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:49,110

1563
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:52,190
It's useful to go ahead and
just play with these equations

1564
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,890
to see why that happens.

1565
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,025
And I think that's a nice
way to think about this

1566
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:59,358
is, in this limit, where we
pull this crossing point all

1567
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:04,370
the way down to 0,
now we have something

1568
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,807
that looks kind of like this.

1569
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:10,120

1570
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,000
So very, very low
rate of degradation.

1571
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,840
But then also the
production rate

1572
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,894
essentially goes to 0
when we're at this point.

1573
01:20:20,894 --> 01:20:22,810
So we could still
parameterize as k over gamma

1574
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:27,090
if we want, with some--
but we could just

1575
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:31,870
think about this as being
at 100 of these mRNAs, say.

1576
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,910
But then we're changing the
production degradation rate.

1577
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,150
And the variance
over the mean here--

1578
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:39,025
does anybody have a
guess of where that goes?

1579
01:20:39,025 --> 01:20:43,462

1580
01:20:43,462 --> 01:20:44,920
In this case it
actually goes to 0.

1581
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,950

1582
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:52,500
And this is an interesting
situation, because really,

1583
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,562
in the limit where
there's no degradation,

1584
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:56,270
and it's all at the
production side, what

1585
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,720
it's saying is that you produce,
you produce, you produce,

1586
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,320
until you get to this
number, which might be 100,

1587
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,260
and then you simply
stop doing anything.

1588
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,820
You're not degrading,
you're not producing.

1589
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:13,380
In that case all the cells will
have exactly 100, maybe, mRNA.

1590
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:16,420
And what the Fokker-Planck
kind of formalism

1591
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:19,420
tells you is that just because
production and degradation

1592
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,570
rates are equal, f
minus g is equal to 0,

1593
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,374
doesn't mean that--
that tells you

1594
01:21:24,374 --> 01:21:26,540
that that's the equilibrium,
but it doesn't tell you

1595
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,998
how much spread there's going
to be around the equilibrium.

1596
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:31,960
If f and g are each larger,
that leads to a larger spread

1597
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,140
because there's more randomness,
whereas here, f and g are

1598
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,420
both essentially
0 at that point.

1599
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,260
What that means is
that you kind of just

1600
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:40,786
pile up right at
that precise value.

1601
01:21:40,786 --> 01:21:44,764

1602
01:21:44,764 --> 01:21:46,680
We are out of time, so
I think we should quit.

1603
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,170
But I am available
for the next half hour

1604
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,378
if anybody has any questions.

1605
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:50,910
Thanks.
