00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:20,975

10
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,350
PROFESSOR: So
today, what we want

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,402
to do is we want to talk
about two related topics.

12
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:26,860
The first is going
to this question

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,670
of the evolution of
virulence and how

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,830
to model host-parasite
interactions more broadly.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,580
That's kind of modeled on
chapter 11 of Martin's book.

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,040
We'll focus on the first half
of it for the discussions today.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,320
This is in the context of
when a given host can only

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,320
have one strain of the
parasite or virus or whatnot

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,890
inside that body.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,630
The model presented
in Martin's book

21
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,590
is very similar to classic
models in epidemiology, which

22
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,750
are the so-called
SIR type models,

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,130
where you divide up
the host population

24
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,200
into whether the they
are sensitive-- i.e.,

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,360
non-infected--
infected, or resistant.

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,120
And then, we'll
draw the parallels

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,030
of how we get from the model
that you read about in Martin's

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,990
book to the classic SIR models.

29
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,450
But in both of these cases,
the fundamental parameter

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,690
that drives these things
is this R0 parameter.

31
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,989
It tells us about the
expected number of new cases

32
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,280
that will result when you
introduce one infected member

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,664
into the population.

34
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:37,460
AUDIENCE: Sorry, will you be
taking about super-infections?

35
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,280
PROFESSOR: Only a
little bit but, I

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,920
would say, depending on time.

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,530
But if you're interested in
the super-infection discussion

38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,156
more, we can talk about
it after class, maybe.

39
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:46,655
All right.

40
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,609

41
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,150
And so, for the
second half of class,

42
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,733
what we're going to
do though is we're

43
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:56,320
going to talk about the possible
evolutionary benefits of sex.

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,700
And in particular, we'll talk
about this hypothesis, which

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,110
is one of the reigning
hypotheses for why it might

46
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,640
be that sex is as widespread as
it is, which is the Red Queen

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,970
hypothesis, from
Lewis Carroll's novel.

48
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,730
And we're going to discuss this
paper that you guys read about,

49
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,188
"Running with the
Red Queen," which

50
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:18,290
I think has a nice
discussion of this debate

51
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,130
and, then, some nice
experiments looking

52
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,880
at experimental coevolution
between the C. elegans worm

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,420
and it's infecting parasite,
which is a serratia bacterium.

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,190

55
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,880
Any questions
before we get going?

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,770

57
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,390
OK, what I want to do
is start by discussing

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,630
this model in Martin's book.

59
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,860
But also, there's a little bit
of this philosophical question.

60
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,600
Any time, that you are
modeling, you always

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,869
had to make decisions
about which of the details

62
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:57,910
you want to try to model
and which of the details

63
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,290
you do not want to model.

64
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,750
And depending upon
the situation,

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,890
it may be that some
assumptions are more or less

66
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,510
appropriate than others.

67
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,920
Now, in the model that
Martin wrote down-- well,

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,150
we'll try to figure out what
the assumptions are here.

69
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,140
So we have what
you might think of

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,840
as some sensitive individuals.

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,240
Plus, the infected
individuals are going

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,590
to interact at some rate, beta.

73
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,230
So this is how the
sensitive become infected.

74
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,300
And it results in, now,
two infected individuals.

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,020

76
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,920
Now of course, each
of these individuals

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,810
will, say, have some
lifespan or die at some rate.

78
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,200
All right, so the sensitive
or uninfected individuals

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
die at rate u.

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,290
Whereas, infected individuals,
others-- an increase

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,658
in the death-rate, described
by some virulence, v. OK?

82
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:01,817

83
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,230
OK.

84
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,136
Now, the model as
written-- what's

85
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,760
going to be the fate
of the population?

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,870

87
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,774
AUDIENCE: Everyone all dies.

88
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

89
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,579
Everyone's going to die, right?

90
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,279
And that's even true
in the-- it's not

91
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,910
even that the population's dying
as a result of the infection.

92
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,216
Because even in the absence
of any infected individuals,

93
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:27,340
you just have people dying.

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,270
So you need to have some way of
keeping the population going,

95
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,080
so you can study it perhaps.

96
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,830
What we're going to assume is
that sensitive individuals,

97
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,770
or uninfected individuals,
will enter the population just

98
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,650
at some rate, k.

99
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,330

100
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,120
Now, in terms of the
philosophical question,

101
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,680
in the beginning of
the chapter, Martin

102
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,820
talks a bit about this
question of microparasites

103
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,460
versus macroparasites.

104
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,425
And I can somebody remind
us, what's the distinction?

105
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:06,695
and For what kind of
parasite might this

106
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:07,790
be intended to model?

107
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,560

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,080
Yes?

109
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,460
AUDIENCE: Well, what I got
from it is that microparasites

110
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,348
are on the order of
single-cellular organisms,

111
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:34,256
generally things that have much
shorter reproductive steps,

112
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:35,679
I guess.

113
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,220
They reproduce a
lot more frequently.

114
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,768
PROFESSOR: That's right.

115
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,184
AUDIENCE: Whereas,
macro-parasites

116
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:43,642
are like the [INAUDIBLE] or
the tapeworm or something,

117
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:48,088
which would not
necessarily reproduce

118
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,570
a lot inside the host.

119
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,710
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

120
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,210
Right.

121
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,690
And I would say, that just
given this distinction

122
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,420
between the microparasites, that
might be viruses and bacteria,

123
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,836
as compared to the
macroparasites,

124
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:00,720
that are things like
tapeworms and so forth, it's

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,950
not obvious from that
that you would have two

126
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,520
different modeling frameworks.

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,050
But what is the argument that
is made in Martin's book?

128
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,030
Or can you think up
an argument for why

129
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,270
it is that it might be this
kind of model you would

130
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,561
want to use for microparasites?

131
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:19,145

132
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:19,726
Yes.

133
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,101
AUDIENCE: Because
we don't really

134
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,568
care about-- he
mentioned something

135
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:24,035
that the microparasites
reproduce

136
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,480
in large numbers in
infected individuals.

137
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,169
So we don't have to keep
track of the internal state

138
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,380
of someone that's infected.

139
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,510
PROFESSOR: That's right.

140
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,440
And some of it's, maybe,
even a historical thing.

141
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,590
There might be huge numbers of
viruses-- a flu virus or so--

142
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,440
in an infected individual.

143
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,430
And in some ways,
maybe, the number

144
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,409
of viruses that is in that host
is not the most relevant thing.

145
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,950
And it's certainly
would be much more

146
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,730
complicated to try to
keep track of that.

147
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,635
And so, if you can get
meaningful predictions-- rather

148
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,260
than keeping track of the number
of viruses, say, in each host,

149
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,570
instead you just put the
host into different classes--

150
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,199
sensitive and
infected, for example.

151
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,990
Later, we'll talk about
what happens if you

152
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,150
have a resistant type of class.

153
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,730
But the idea there is that
there's, maybe, even also

154
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,550
some separation of time scales.

155
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,830
Because you get infected.

156
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,376
And kind of quickly, you're
just sick and may be infective.

157
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,750
But at some rate,
you get better.

158
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,120
And it's not that
you'll necessarily

159
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,890
gain very much by keeping
track of the precise number

160
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,450
of viruses in the host.

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,050
Of course, this is ultimately
an experimental observational

162
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,840
question of whether
this sort of model

163
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,552
provides you inside
that you're going

164
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,510
to need to make sense of
these diseases, right?

165
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,995
AUDIENCE: And then it also
seems like your method

166
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,977
of transmission
of macroparasites

167
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,480
can be very different.

168
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
PROFESSOR: That's right.

169
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,510
So the mechanism of
transmission depends

170
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,310
very much on the disease
that you're studying.

171
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,200
And the macroparasites,
in many cases,

172
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,260
they're transmitted not
from direct interactions

173
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,450
between the hosts, but through
the environment or something

174
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,950
else.

175
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,120

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,140
It's also, perhaps,
just worth pointing out

177
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,260
that parasites are just a
ubiquitous aspect of life.

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,290
So you can name an organism,
and you can pretty much

179
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,560
be guaranteed that there's
going to be some notion

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,650
of a parasite on that organism.

181
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,860
And there can be
multiple layers of this.

182
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,590
So we certainly
have many parasites.

183
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,630
We're infected by many viruses
and bacteria and other things.

184
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,830
But bacteria-- we think of
them as being very small--

185
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,289
they're also preyed upon
by these phage, which

186
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,842
is a parasite that targets
specifically bacteria.

187
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,800
So it's not just that
it's an incidental thing.

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,570
But these are really viruses
that have evolved specifically

189
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,920
to divide in bacteria.

190
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
And we didn't really talk
about this very much.

191
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,890
But one of the classic models
for cooperation and cheating

192
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,690
is based on what you
could think about as

193
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,120
some sort of parasitic
sub-population within phage.

194
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,110
So this is a classic
paper by Lin Chow where

195
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,480
he showed that if you
evolved phage and bacteria

196
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,290
in a condition where many phage
infect a given bacteria, then,

197
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,394
you can evolve what you
could think of as cheater

198
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,560
strategies or cheater phage.

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,270
Because these are
phage that maybe

200
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,680
can't reproduce on their
own, but have shorter genomes

201
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,350
and can out-replicate
the normal phage.

202
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,550
So if both of these end up
in a single bacterial cell,

203
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,560
then these cheater
phage can spread

204
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,810
by taking advantage of, say,
the replication machinery

205
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,060
from the rest of the phage.

206
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,740
So in some ways, you might
call that some sort of DNA

207
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,172
parasite or so.

208
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,630
So there's really parasites in
many, many different levels.

209
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,965

210
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

211
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,905
PROFESSOR: Yes?

212
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ultimately think about is, k,

213
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,260
is this really the number--

214
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,050
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you know, I would

215
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,470
say that the k is, in some ways,
not a very satisfying feature

216
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,120
of this model.

217
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,670
Because it makes it feel that
the model is very special,

218
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,170
right?

219
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,265
AUDIENCE: But I mean,
in a natural population

220
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:19,740
and rate at which people are
born, is that the same change?

221
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,460
Or--

222
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,060
PROFESSOR: Yes.

223
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,320
That was the example
I was going to give.

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,170
It's not clear-- of course,
it requires somebody

225
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,370
to give birth to kids, right?

226
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,705
So in that sense, modeling this
as a constant number per unit

227
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:39,660
of time-- which is what
we're doing-- this rate k,

228
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,730
is a little bit funny.

229
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,480
Because then, what
you'd really want to do

230
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,970
is say, oh, maybe
it's these guys that

231
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,130
give birth at some rate
or so, if you really

232
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,420
wanted to be accurate.

233
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,470
So I'd say that this
is, in some ways, just

234
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,142
a mathematical simplification
so that we can get

235
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,350
at the heart of the dynamics.

236
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,020
And what we'll see is
that, in these SIR models,

237
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,180
you don't invoke
anything like this.

238
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,510
But rather, what you do is
you assume that, at some rate,

239
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,430
infected individuals
don't just die.

240
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,500
But they become resistant.

241
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,560
And then, maybe later, they
become sensitive again.

242
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,956
So you need some way of
being sure that it's not

243
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:19,080
the case that everybody
just always dies.

244
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,700
So in some ways, this is more
mathematical convenience.

245
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,589
And the basic
conclusions end up being

246
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,130
very robust to these
sorts of things.

247
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:32,420

248
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,250
All right, so in
these models, it's

249
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,180
always good to be
clear about how

250
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,280
we go from this framework
to something that is more

251
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,870
of a differential equation.

252
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,500
And what we can
do is we can think

253
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,920
about these uninfected
individuals, i.e.

254
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,605
the S-es as compared
to the infected.

255
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:55,060

256
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,335
And we're going to
have these guys be x.

257
00:11:57,335 --> 00:12:01,680

258
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
And this S and I.

259
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,670
So the way that the
x will be changing

260
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,135
is that we're assuming
that there's always

261
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,510
some influx of
individuals, which

262
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,035
could be birth or migration
or something else,

263
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,537
that are just always entering.

264
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,120
But then, there's
going to be two ways

265
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,670
that x is going to decrease.

266
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,780
One is that there's just a
death rate that is resulting

267
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,627
in the absence of infection.

268
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,085
But then, also,
there's going to be

269
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,110
some rate of infection,
which is going

270
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,470
to be proportional to beta.

271
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,960
So this is the
simplest way that you

272
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,890
can imagine capturing
this element

273
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,870
that the infected individuals
can transmit the infection

274
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,090
to the sensitive individuals.

275
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,290
So we're modeling them as
a well-mixed population,

276
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,780
just like in chemical reactions.

277
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,500
And somehow, the
rate of infection

278
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,080
is proportional to the frequency
that they hit each other.

279
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,810
Certainly, the simplest kind
of model you can imagine.

280
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,250
Whereas, the infected
individuals-- well,

281
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,530
we're going to have an
increased rate of death.

282
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,180
So this is a simplified
way to write it.

283
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,120

284
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,230
So this is really that there's
a minus, u plus v times y.

285
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,130
So this is just the death rate.

286
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,530
But then, any individual that
leaves the sensitive class--

287
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,460
this minus beta xy--
enters the infected class.

288
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,120

289
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,860
This makes a lot
of sense, I think.

290
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,310
Now, the question is, can we
make sense of what's going on?

291
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:49,215
Now, you saw in your reading
what this R0 parameter was.

292
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:50,960
And you should always
remember that it's

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,970
defined as this thing
of, if you introduce

294
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,460
one infected individual
into a population

295
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,540
of sensitive
individuals, what is

296
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,430
the mean number of new
infections that you get?

297
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,730
And it makes sense that the
key thing is whether that R0

298
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,026
is greater or less than 1.

299
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,400
Because if it's
greater than one,

300
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,204
that leads to this
exponential explosion

301
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:14,370
of the infected individuals.

302
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,500
It doesn't mean that everyone's
going to die, necessarily.

303
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,580
We'll get into that.

304
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,760
But if R0 is less
than 1, then you

305
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,710
expect that
infection to die out.

306
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,380
So why is it that if
R0 is greater than 1,

307
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,130
and you introduce one
infected individual,

308
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,149
it doesn't necessarily
lead to a wipe-out

309
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,190
of the entire population?

310
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:42,860

311
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,822
Or maybe it does.

312
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,030
This model is a little funny.

313
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,988
Because you always have
an individual entering.

314
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:51,581

315
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:52,080
But--

316
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,415
AUDIENCE: If the [INAUDIBLE]
is really virulent,

317
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,872
then only infected
individuals die before--

318
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:57,580
PROFESSOR: Right.

319
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,984
So if it's very virulent,
then the infected individuals

320
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:00,650
may die quickly.

321
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,930
And this gets into
this question of there

322
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,804
may be some trade-offs
in terms of virulence.

323
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:07,190
And we'll talk more about, then,
the evolution of virulence.

324
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,820
But there's a wide variety
of classes of models,

325
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,020
not just the ones where
you have k entering.

326
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,461
But the question somehow
is-- just because R0

327
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,960
is greater than 1,
that doesn't mean

328
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,667
that the entire population will
necessarily become infected.

329
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,750
Because we have this idea
of an exponential growth

330
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,740
of the infected population
if R0 is greater than 1.

331
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,330
So why is it that
it's not necessarily

332
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,780
going to happen that the
entire population is-- well,

333
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,411
this question's a little
bit ill-posed in this model.

334
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:47,259
AUDIENCE: Is it because the
number of sensitive individuals

335
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,320
becomes very low
at some point and--

336
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
PROFESSOR: That's right.

337
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,010
And I think this is
the basic intuition.

338
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,440
As more and more members of
the population become infected,

339
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,610
then that could, in
principle, reduce

340
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,760
to the possibilities for new
individuals to be susceptible.

341
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,770

342
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:15,310
And I'm using susceptible and
sensitive interchangeably.

343
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,990
And so eventually,
this exponential growth

344
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,951
of the population can
be limited in some way.

345
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,700
We'll maybe look at
this a little bit more

346
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,960
in this SIR model.

347
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,636
Because it's more clear.

348
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:29,890
AUDIENCE: So we
basically collect a rate.

349
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,404
R0 is a rate, right?

350
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:34,258

351
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:34,758
[INAUDIBLE]

352
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,240
PROFESSOR: No.

353
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,440
It's a number.

354
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,894
It's the expected
number of new infections

355
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:43,185
that you get when you introduce
one infected individual

356
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,681
into the population.

357
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,180
And we're--

358
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,801
AUDIENCE: It's like, period.

359
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:51,730
So there's not, like,
per-unit time or--

360
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,030
PROFESSOR: It's
a number, period.

361
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,940
AUDIENCE: OK, so if
you have R equal to 1,

362
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,386
you expect that
when you introduce

363
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,073
an infected individual
into a population

364
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:04,051
of sensitive individuals, you
will get one other infected

365
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:04,550
individual.

366
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:04,710
PROFESSOR: That's right.

367
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,240
So that's kind of the
neutrally-stable situation.

368
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,516
If R0 is 1, then you add
one infected individual

369
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:12,099
and you expect to get one other
one, so you have a random walk

370
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,970
and-- well, in general,
it will randomly

371
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,221
go extinct, eventually.

372
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:16,720
Yes?

373
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,672
AUDIENCE: What is the
lifetime of the infected--

374
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,530
PROFESSOR: So it depends.

375
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,560
And so, that's what we're
going to do right now

376
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,339
is see if we can reconstruct
what this R0 is equal to

377
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,860
in this model.

378
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,720
AUDIENCE: Another
quick question--

379
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,060
what's the distribution
of the-- so--

380
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,690
PROFESSOR: Yes.

381
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,340
AUDIENCE: --a
deterministic role--

382
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,360
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

383
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,317
So this is very interesting.

384
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:40,400
The question is, what is
going to the distribution

385
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,160
of the number of
infected individuals?

386
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,920
And in this model,
we're assuming

387
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,690
that every infected
individuals is the same.

388
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,590
So we should be able
to-- I wish that we

389
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,580
just, on the wall somewhere,
had our five different standard

390
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,860
probability distributions,
so that we could always

391
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,980
go back to them.

392
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,180
So the question
is, in this model,

393
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,486
if you introduce one infected
individual in the population,

394
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,360
how many new infected
individuals do you get?

395
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,800
R0 tells you about the mean.

396
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,270
But will you always
get the mean?

397
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,270
No.

398
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,160
So let's all think about
this for 10 seconds.

399
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,500
And we will verbally
yell out what

400
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,250
we think the
distribution will be

401
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,610
of the number of new infections
from a single infected

402
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,110
individual.

403
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,755

404
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:25,255
OK?

405
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:31,960

406
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,870
Verbally, ready!

407
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,146
Five, (WHISPERING) four--

408
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,730

409
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,480
AUDIENCE: Poisson.

410
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,722
AUDIENCE: Piosson.

411
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,384
AUDIENCE: Exponential

412
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,550
PROFESSOR: All right,
everybody thinks it's Poisson.

413
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,549
Why would it be Poisson?

414
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,670

415
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,539
AUDIENCE: Because
you have a rate--

416
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:51,622
AUDIENCE: It's not a rate.

417
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:53,598
AUDIENCE: It's not?

418
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,862
AUDIENCE: The initial
population is much larger--

419
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:56,570
PROFESSOR: Right.

420
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,510
OK, so the idea
is that we imagine

421
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,490
we're some infected individual.

422
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,770
And there's some rate that
we are infecting others.

423
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,110
Now, if I ask you the question,
how many individuals will I

424
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,990
infect in the next 10 days?

425
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,030
Or we could do 21 days
if you guys like that.

426
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,760
So all right, if I
ask, how many do I

427
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,010
infect in the next 10 days?

428
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,680
Now, I'm assuming
that I stay alive.

429
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,349
But let's say,
assuming I stay alive,

430
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,140
how many do I infect
over the next 10 days?

431
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,750
That's going to be distributed
as-- that is Poisson.

432
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,280
But the question you're
asking is a different one.

433
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,440
You're asking,
what is going to be

434
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,690
the distribution of the total
number of new infections

435
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,710
that I cause?

436
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,130
And this is precisely
the same situation

437
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,930
that we've analyzed
lots and lots of times.

438
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,155
What does it look like?

439
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,580
AUDIENCE: Geometric
distribution.

440
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,205
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

441
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:55,480
AUDIENCE: Geometric.

442
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,750
PROFESSOR: OK, yes.

443
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,910
It's going to be a
geometric distribution.

444
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,470
But why?

445
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,890
AUDIENCE: Well, because you
can have an infection and then

446
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,640
another infection.

447
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,050
And so then, it's,
like, multiples of ten.

448
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,050
PROFESSOR: That's right.

449
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,530
So we have an
infected individual.

450
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,120
There's two things
that can happen.

451
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,930

452
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,600
He's going to die at some rate.

453
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,560
And there's this
other rate, which

454
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,367
is going to go as
beta times x or so,

455
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,200
telling us about the
rate of new infections.

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,908
And we want to know,
how many times do we

457
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:34,310
go around this loop before we
degrade, or die, or something,

458
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,849
disappear from the population?

459
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,140
Does this look at all familiar?

460
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,170
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

461
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,460
PROFESSOR: All right.

462
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,145
Were you guys the
same students that

463
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:41,345
were here for the first
half of the class?

464
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,240
AUDIENCE: Ha.

465
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,038
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

466
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:43,538
No.

467
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:47,031
AUDIENCE: And so, R0 is
like the [INAUDIBLE]?

468
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:52,021
It's like the number of--

469
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,017
AUDIENCE: It's the
mean number for bursts.

470
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:56,530
AUDIENCE: You haven't
evaluated when the population--

471
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,342
PROFESSOR: So R0 is the
mean size of protein bursts,

472
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,050
in the context of this
other model, which

473
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,258
was-- what was the situation?

474
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:05,471

475
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:07,720
And this one's a really good
one for you guys to know.

476
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,719
It's going to be useful.

477
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:13,230

478
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,970
So we saw this exact model in
the context of gene expression.

479
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,381
And what was the
situation that we--

480
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:21,880
AUDIENCE: Production
of [INAUDIBLE].

481
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,877
PROFESSOR: Production of--

482
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:24,160
AUDIENCE: --proteins
from a single mRNA.

483
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the production
of proteins from a single mRNA.

484
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:26,840
Right?

485
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,130
Because remember, we had this
thing where we had the mRNA.

486
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,850
And we said, oh, well
the mRNA is going

487
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,450
to be degraded at some rate.

488
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,732
But also, it's going to be
translated at some rate.

489
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,190
So the distribution
number of times

490
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,149
that it's translated
before it degrades

491
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:40,190
is going to be geometric.

492
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,500
Because we go around this
loop some number of times.

493
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,050
All right, so this
is the same thing.

494
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:52,150
And the paper that I put
as supplementary reading,

495
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,870
by Jamie Lloyd-Smith?

496
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,200
I always get his name and
Jamie Lloyd Wright-- right?

497
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,075
Something-- mixed up.

498
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,241
But yeah, Jamie Lloyd-Smith.

499
00:21:59,241 --> 00:21:59,770
Smith.

500
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:05,050
So he was studying the
dynamics of infections

501
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,110
when you have this
thing where there's

502
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,100
intrinsic variation in, say, the
infectivity of an individual.

503
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
Because here, you get this
geometric distribution,

504
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,010
even though all the individuals
are, in principal, identical.

505
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,140
Now, the question is, if there's
some distributions of, say,

506
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,650
infectivities, then
you'll get an even broader

507
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,585
distribution of resulting
number of new infections.

508
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:29,470

509
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,670
So there's this classic
thing of Typhoid Mary.

510
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,390

511
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,346
She's was a nurse-- OK, now
I don't remember the story.

512
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:38,846
Yeah?

513
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:39,840
AUDIENCE: She was a cook.

514
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,589
PROFESSOR: A cook.

515
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, a cook, nurse--

516
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,733
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so she
cooked for a lot of people.

517
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,120
PROFESSOR: OK, so she was
somehow resistant to typhoid.

518
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,852
But then, she was cooking for
other people and, so then,

519
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:50,060
caused a bunch of infections.

520
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,560
Is that--?

521
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,366
OK.

522
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:52,740
Yeah, so this
would be an example

523
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,810
of a very infective
individual that's

524
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,590
beyond the assumptions
in this model.

525
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,800
And as you can imagine,
if you have variations

526
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,490
in this infectivity, then
what it does, for a given R0--

527
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,080
so if you fix R0, then you
have a broader distribution

528
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,720
of infectivity.

529
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,270
What it means is that a larger
fraction of the infections

530
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,310
will go extinct.

531
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,826
But those that get
going will be explosive.

532
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,700
If you're curious about
these sorts of ideas,

533
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,380
you should look at this
optional reading paper

534
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,697
that I put out there.

535
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,280
All right, so I just
want to be clear.

536
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,221
This is geometric number of
new infections, distribution

537
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:33,970
of new infections.

538
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,550

539
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,050
Yes?

540
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,410
AUDIENCE: So is
this just one cycle?

541
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,350
Like, one--

542
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,320
PROFESSOR: So we're talking
about the number of infections

543
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,915
that result when you just
add one infected individual

544
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:52,685
to the population.

545
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:55,222
AUDIENCE: OK, so then, you
don't think about, afterwards,

546
00:23:55,222 --> 00:23:56,972
what happens to those
infected individuals

547
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,064
and if they infect--

548
00:23:58,064 --> 00:24:00,230
PROFESSOR: Well, we are not
yet thinking about them.

549
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,460
Although, in this case,
those are also geometrically

550
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,260
distributed.

551
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,690
But what you expect is that
the mean of those things

552
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,620
will change.

553
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,970
Because the number of
susceptible or whatnot

554
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,300
individuals-- that's
going to change.

555
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,200
So the mean number
is going to change.

556
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,381
But the distributions
will still be geometric.

557
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,786
AUDIENCE: But in total, that
won't be geometric anymore.

558
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:23,619
Because if we're looking
at the total number

559
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:27,077
of infected individuals after
learning about the geometric--

560
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:27,660
PROFESSOR: No.

561
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,100
So just because each of
these sub-steps is geometric

562
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,910
does not mean that you end up
with a geometric distribution.

563
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,977
Indeed, let's say that i put
in 20 infected individuals

564
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:41,810
into the population.

565
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,990
And I ask, what's going
to be the distribution

566
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,750
of the number of infections
caused immediately

567
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,770
from those 20?

568
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,030
That's going to be what?

569
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

570
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,020
Yeah, and for 20, it's going
to be basically Gaussian.

571
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,414
OK, well if I said 100,
well definitely Gaussian.

572
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,330
It's a gamma distribution
that looks very much

573
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,062
look a Gaussian, in that case.

574
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:05,837
All right?

575
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,240
All right.

576
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,610
So we've been talking about
the definition of this R0.

577
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,495
But of course, we should
figure out what it is.

578
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:18,900
We want R0 is
equal to-- and what

579
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:26,262
I'm going to tell you is that
there's a 1 over u plus v.

580
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:27,720
But then, there's
some other terms.

581
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,330
And I've unfortunately
lost my notes.

582
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,479
So you guys are going to have
to help me figure this out.

583
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,020
And what you're
going to do is you're

584
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,603
going to take advantage
of your cards.

585
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,390
And again, put things
in the numerators

586
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,884
and the denominators,
corresponding

587
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,800
to how I'm supposed to
fill out this equation.

588
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,039

589
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,580
You can start thinking about it
while I give you the options.

590
00:25:46,580 --> 00:26:01,800

591
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,820
OK.

592
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,809
So I guess you could
recapitulate this

593
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,600
by just putting B and
C, although maybe you

594
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,772
need it more than once.

595
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:10,480
Do what you will.

596
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,404
Do you understand the question?

597
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,820
There's going to
be something else

598
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,790
I'm going to put right here.

599
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,756
And I want to know--
there are going

600
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:18,290
to be somethings in the
numerator, somethings

601
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,081
in the denominator.

602
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:22,120

603
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm going to give you 30
seconds to think about it.

604
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,714
Because it's important
to be able to reason

605
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:27,630
your way through this.

606
00:26:27,630 --> 00:27:13,786

607
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:16,136
All right, do need more time?

608
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,080
Yep, OK.

609
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,680
I'll give you
another 15 seconds.

610
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:46,021

611
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,420
All right, let's
go ahead and vote.

612
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,370
Ready?

613
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,040
Three, two, one.

614
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,320
All right.

615
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,820
I like it!

616
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,064
We're really looking quite nice.

617
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,480
So there's a claim
that it's going

618
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:08,336
to be AD over B. We should
be writing a beta k over u.

619
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:10,770
All right.

620
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,880
Can somebody explain
how they got there?

621
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:21,710

622
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,957
Yes, please.

623
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:29,747
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
going to be-- these two--

624
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:30,580
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

625
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,640
This helped, right?

626
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,390
OK, good, perfect.

627
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,392
So this thing is what?

628
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,242
What is this term here?

629
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:43,034
AUDIENCE: That's the death rate.

630
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:43,830
PROFESSOR: Right.

631
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,095
Which means that the one over
it is the expected lifetime

632
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,970
of an infected individual.

633
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,360
So the definition of R0 is,
you put an infected individual

634
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,027
into a population
of susceptibles.

635
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,610
Now, we want to know,
OK, well there's

636
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,860
a expected lifetime of this
infected individual, which

637
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,915
is given by this.

638
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,540
And then, we have to
think about, well,

639
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,081
what's the rate that we're going
to be infecting individuals?

640
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:10,850
And that's going
to be beta times x.

641
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,590
But what we want to know is, is
x before we add any infection?

642
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,251
And without any infection, then
we just have a rate of entry

643
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,250
and, then, a death rate.

644
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,067
So it's just k over u.

645
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:22,567
OK?

646
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:25,850

647
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,960
Now, the key thing in all of
these epidemiological models

648
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,190
is whether this R0 is
greater or less than 1.

649
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,340
And that's going to tell us
whether the disease becomes

650
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,920
endemic or not, whether,
at steady state,

651
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,140
we have a population of
infected individuals.

652
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,060
So R0, greater than one, means
it's in an endemic population.

653
00:29:52,060 --> 00:30:05,530

654
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,884
Now, in this model,
we can then ask--

actually feel bad erasing it.

leave it up there --

So in this model,
the fact that R0

676
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
is this parameter
that tells us about

an epidemic and then, indeed,

whether later the

But the initial
insight about what

697
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,580
is going to be
selected for comes

698
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,688

00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
PROFESSOR: That's right.

706
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,240
And so, what he does
is he just writes down

707
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,180
this model of where he now
allows two different parasites

708
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,860
to be spreading the population.

709
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,380
And at the beginning--
well, we'll write it down.

710
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,890
And we want to be clear.

711
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,080
There's a very important
assumption that he makes.

712
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,400
What he's going to find is
that selection maximizes R0,

713
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,988
the basic reproductive ratio.

714
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:47,749

715
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:49,165
And it's going to
be in this model

716
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,560
that I'm writing down now.

717
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,530
So there's this x dot.

718
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,950
And things look very similar.

719
00:32:53,950 --> 00:33:17,806

720
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:18,350
All right.

721
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,349
Now, the question is,
what is the key assumption

722
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:22,580
that we're making in writing
down these equations?

723
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:36,606

724
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:37,105
Thought?

725
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:40,869

726
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,910
AUDIENCE: One cannot have
more than one type of--

727
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,909
PROFESSOR: That's right.

728
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,710
A host cannot be infected by
more than one type of strain.

729
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,830
So that's very, very important.

730
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,514
So there's no
super-infection, as they say.

731
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:59,554

732
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:00,970
And depending on
the disease, this

733
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,170
could either be a better
or worse assumption.

734
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,330
But then, what is it that
is defining these two

735
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,150
strains then?

736
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,483
In what ways are they different?

737
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:13,919

738
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,889
AUDIENCE: In virulence.

739
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,489
PROFESSOR: Their
virulence is different.

740
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,430
And what is virulence again?

741
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,514
AUDIENCE: How likely it
is that it could kill you.

742
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:24,513
PROFESSOR: That's right.

743
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,159
It's the additional
mortality that

744
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,717
is caused by being
affected by that strain.

745
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,550
Is that the only way
that they're different?

746
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,092
AUDIENCE: No.

747
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:32,675
PROFESSOR: No.

748
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:33,683
What else is different?

749
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:34,116
AUDIENCE: The infectivity.

750
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,600
PROFESSOR: The
infectivity, right.

751
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,850
So the betas are also different.

752
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,190
And it's imported to
note that in this model--

753
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,750
it's a very simple
model-- but we're

754
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,360
allowing the strains to be
different in these two ways.

755
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,090
And I think that
it's very intuitive

756
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:53,080
to just say that, oh, well,
you want to have a larger beta,

757
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,000
all other things equal.

758
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,650
Because you would
like to spread.

759
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,480
But I'd say, maybe,
it's not as obvious what

760
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,160
happens in terms of virulence.

761
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,730
And then, of
course, if you think

762
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,200
about these two parameters--
in any biological context

763
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,510
they may be coupled.

764
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,176
In which case, things
are more subtle.

765
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:18,016
AUDIENCE: So how reasonable
is something of something

766
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,440
of [INAUDIBLE] on the strain?

767
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,972
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think that
this depends on the disease.

768
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:23,888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

769
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,372
Is it that you're trading
virulence and new response

770
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:27,872
and--

771
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,740
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
somehow the argument.

772
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,510
And I'd say that,
depending on whether you're

773
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,380
thinking about the host at the
level of an organism or a cell,

774
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,920
then this would correspond
to very different worlds.

775
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
So certainly, in the
context of viral infections

776
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,870
and individual cells, there
are various mechanisms

777
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,020
where, if one strain gets
in, then other strains

778
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,960
have trouble getting in.

779
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,920
Or if they do get in,
they can't do anything.

780
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,446
So I think, this really
depends on the biology

781
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:05,821
of the situation, whether this
is a reasonable assumption

782
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:06,321
or not.

783
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:20,242

784
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,200
So I'm not going to go
through all of the math.

785
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,150
Because it ends up being
a little bit involved.

786
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:31,610
But the condition for the mutual
invasibility of the two strains

787
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,300
is a little bit subtle.

788
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,130
So I do want to talk
about that a little bit.

789
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,930
And so, in general,
in this model

790
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:53,900
there's some equilibrium,
x star and y star.

791
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,677
And indeed, there will
generally be damped oscillations

792
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:58,510
to this equilibrium.

793
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,470

794
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,480
So this is in the model
where there's just

795
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,460
a single strain that's
described by some beta

796
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,740
and some v. Of
course, you can also

797
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:18,640
think about the equilibria, E1
and E2, that would result when

798
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,050
you have-- so E1 is what would
happen at the equilibrium

799
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:30,550
when you have x star evaluated
for the particular parameters

800
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,850
of strain one, i.e.

801
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,810
evaluated for beta1 and for v1.

802
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,120
x star-- and that's also y star.

803
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Whereas, you would have
a different equilibrium,

804
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,030
E2-- so this is a x
star and a y star--

805
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,110
evaluated at beta2 and v2.

806
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,890
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

807
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,390
So these are the
equilibria that you

808
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,645
would have if this was
the only strain that

809
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:57,350
was present in the population
or if this was the only strain

810
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,620
in the population.

811
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,880
Now, it's not obvious that
those-- the equilibria--

812
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,010
are the result when
you have both strains

813
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,670
present in the population.

814
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,560
But that's what we want
to try to figure out.

815
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,510

816
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,895
But certainly, if you
only added strain one

817
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:15,520
and you didn't add strain 2, you
would come to equilibrium, E1.

818
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,300

819
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,745
So the question is, if we
start out at equilibrium E1,

820
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,370
how is it we can
determine what happens

821
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,040
if we now add an
infected individual,

822
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,510
but infected by strain two?

823
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:43,730

824
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,895
So what we want to know
is-- strain 2 can invade.

825
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:52,799

826
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,340
And really, what
we're thinking about

827
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,190
is a situation-- these
are the equilibria if it's

828
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:03,155
the case that R1 is greater
than 1 and R2 is greater than 1.

829
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:05,100
Because in some ways,
it's clear what happens.

830
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,430
If both of the R1 and R2 are
less than 1, then what happens?

831
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,995

832
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:14,120
AUDIENCE: It would die out.

833
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,160
PROFESSOR: They both die out.

834
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,368
If one of them is greater
than 1, one is less than 1.

835
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:20,660
Then, right, the
strain that's below 1

836
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,230
goes-- so the only interesting
or the only the only

837
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,460
non-obvious question,
somehow, is what happens

838
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,800
if they're both larger than 1?

839
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,465
What that means is
that, for example,

840
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:32,590
if you had a population of
susceptible individuals,

841
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,030
and you had one
infected by strain one,

842
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,040
one infected by
strain two, then,

843
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,420
in the deterministic
differential equation limit,

844
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,470
they would both spread.

845
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,939
So they're both
exponentially growing.

846
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:47,480
Does that already
tell us that you're

847
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,380
going to have coexistence
of the two strains?

848
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,116
No.

849
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:54,240
It means that they're both
exponentially spreading.

850
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,800
But who knows what's
going to happen later?

851
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,250
And indeed, what you can show
is that only one of the two

852
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,250
strains is going to win.

853
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,280
And it's the strain with the
higher reproductive ration,

854
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,810
the higher R0, or
in this case, here.

855
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,291

856
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,457
So how is it that we can
determine if strain two can

857
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:13,510
invade equilibrium one?

858
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,795
It's if-and-only-if something.

859
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:18,170
Does anybody remember what
this condition ended up being?

860
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:30,988

861
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:34,470
AUDIENCE: y2 dot at
E1 has to be positive?

862
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:39,010
PROFESSOR: All right, y2 dot
at E1 has to be positive.

863
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,540
Yes.

864
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,370
And this ends up being
equivalent, I think,

865
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,190
to what he writes.

866
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,390
So let's write.

867
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,770
I'll write and tell you.

868
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,540
So the way that he wrote
it, is that it's y2

869
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,761
dot, with respect to y2.

870
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:55,260
But I think that this is really
equivalent to what you said.

871
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,310

872
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,850
Because you said, OK, y2 dot
has to be something, right?

873
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,632
But then, y2 dot evaluated what?

874
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,090
And you would say,
evaluated at E1.

875
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:11,244
But then, at E1-- what is
y2 dot evaluated at E1?

876
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,170
AUDIENCE: 0.

877
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,890
PROFESSOR: 0, right?

878
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,280
Because at E1, there is 0 y2.

879
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,865
So then, of course, y2 dot is 0.

880
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:23,340
So it's almost what you
want, but not quite.

881
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,640
So this condition,
which looks very weird,

882
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,210
is really saying that, if
we are at E1-- so there's

883
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,770
no infected type-two
infections-- what we want to do

884
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,840
is add a little bit of y2.

885
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,360
And then, we want to
ask, what is y2 dot?

886
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,000
And this derivative,
evaluated at E1,

887
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,080
somehow allows you to do that.

888
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,220
And do we want this
to be greater than 0?

889
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,060
Or less than 0?

890
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,661
We're going to do verbal answer.

891
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:50,160
Ready?

892
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,100
Three, two, one.

893
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,850
AUDIENCE: Greater.

894
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,750
PROFESSOR: Greater, right.

895
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,400
Because if it's
saying you add a y2,

896
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,710
you want y2 to start growing.

897
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,610

898
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,450
So you want this thing
to be greater than 0.

899
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,870
And this looks really crazy.

900
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,370
But it's actually
pretty easy to do.

901
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,286
Because you take the
derivative of this thing,

902
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,240
with respect to y2.

903
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,070
And you just get the thing
in parentheses, right?

904
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,700
But you evaluated it at E1.

905
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,400
So it's beta2.

906
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,954
And this is x star at
E1, minus u, minus v2.

907
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,620
And this thing has
to be greater than 0.

908
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,910

909
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:34,340
But this is x at E1.

910
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,710
That's u plus v1
divided by beta1.

911
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:47,650
So what we have is beta 2, then,
u plus v1 divided by beta1.

912
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,220
And this thing has to be greater
than-- we'll move this over

913
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,830
to the other side-- u plus v2.

914
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,680
OK, so this is not
so horrible, right?

915
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,610
There's a u plus
v1, beta1, right?

916
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,839
I just want to make sure I
write-- (WHISPERING) u plus v1.

917
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,130
(NORMAL VOICE) OK, we have
to these in the denominators

918
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,671
now, somehow.

919
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,730

920
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,550
So we'll put divide by
both of these things.

921
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:18,250
So we have a 1 divided
by a u plus v2.

922
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,350
1 divided by u plus v1.

923
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,820
So we put these things
in the denominator.

924
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,550
And now, the beta1 is
going to come up here.

925
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,550
So we have a beta1 and a beta2.

926
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,420
And there still is
a greater-than sign.

927
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,250
Did I screw anything up yet?

928
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:36,750
Maybe?

929
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,920
No?

930
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,420
All right.

931
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,240

932
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,020
Now, we can do
something wonderful,

933
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,100
which is we can just
multiply by k divided by u.

934
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:51,918

935
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:53,490
And so what does this say?

936
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,822

937
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:58,730
AUDIENCE: R2 is greater than R1.

938
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,790
PROFESSOR: R2 is
greater than R1, right?

939
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,359

940
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,900
And what were we
trying to calculate?

941
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,671

942
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:09,170
How did we get
started on this math?

943
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,044

944
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:13,960
AUDIENCE: What can
[INAUDIBLE] the strains.

945
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,418
PROFESSOR: Right,
we wanted to ask,

946
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:19,000
strain two can invade
the equilibrium one,

947
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:31,457
if and only if R2 is
greater than-- now,

948
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:32,540
that's interesting, right?

949
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,164
So that's saying
that, if you start out

950
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:37,290
with the endemic strain
one and you add the strain

951
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,590
two in there, it's going
to be able to invade

952
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,000
if it's R2 is greater than R1.

953
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,720
That's not obvious.

954
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,600
Because R2 and R1,
that was telling us

955
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,317
about a different situation.

956
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,900
That was telling us
about what happens

957
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,520
when you add those infected
individuals into a population

958
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,260
of susceptibles.

959
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,590
But this also ends up
telling us about what

960
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,860
happens when the strains are
competing against each other.

961
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,302
So this is so simple
that it feels trivial.

962
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,260
I'm sure that if you
understood it well enough,

963
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,093
it would be trivial.

964
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:11,540
But you'd have to think
about it more than I have.

965
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,110
So I think this is surprising.

966
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,900
Now, you can also ask
the same question,

967
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:26,010
which is about whether strain
one can invade strain two.

968
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,570
And that is kind
of the same thing.

969
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:32,840
So it all comes down to
the orderings of R2 and R1.

970
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,390
And what you find is that, if
this condition is satisfied,

971
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:42,140
strain two will drive strain
one out of the population.

972
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,996

973
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,904
AUDIENCE: What if they
strains are the same?

974
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:52,320
PROFESSOR: So if
they're the same,

975
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,050
then you can get coexistence.

976
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,920
But as Martin says,
it's non-generic,

977
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,380
in a sense that it's
kind of a coincidence,

978
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,810
or it's of measure
0, the situations

979
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:10,960
in which the two will have
the same R parameters.

980
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,674
But of course, you
could imagine--

981
00:46:12,674 --> 00:46:14,840
just like we talked about
all this neutral evolution

982
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,770
business-- things
are nearly neutral

983
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,730
and so forth, da-da-da-- you can
kind of invoke similar ideas.

984
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:22,310
Because you can imagine that,
as these two become closer

985
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,810
and closer to each
other, it's going

986
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,165
to take longer and longer
for the more-fit strain

987
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:28,880
to out-compete the
less-fit strain.

988
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,820

989
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,310
Now, even though this is
such a simple condition

990
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:41,560
and the R parameters have
such a simple physical origin

991
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,260
or mathematical origin, the
actual expression for the Rs

992
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,880
is kind of complicated.

993
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,829
But again, it's a
combination of all

994
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:50,620
of these different
parameters, whether it's

995
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,860
the beta1, B1, or beta2, v2.

996
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:06,190

997
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,205
Which board do you
think is least useful?

998
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:13,530

999
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,079
Well, I don't want
this one anymore.

1000
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,870
But in particular, we
want to say something

1001
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,510
about the evolution of
virulence in this model

1002
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,577
and what the expectation is.

1003
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:26,160
So what we're going
to do is I'm going

1004
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,180
to give you some different
situations, in terms

1005
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,220
of how the infectivity
depends upon the virulence.

1006
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,390
And then, you guys
will get to tell me

1007
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,185
how the virulence will evolve.

1008
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:55,520

1009
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:24,720
Now, this is virulence, v. All
right, so the first situation

1010
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,230
is if beta as a function
of the virulence-- so

1011
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:35,250
the infectivity as a function
of virulence is, we'll say,

1012
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,110
some beta0.

1013
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,570
So first, the question is,
if the infectivity does not

1014
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:47,940
depend upon the virulence,
where will virulence go to?

1015
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,750

1016
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,460
You have equation, various
places that'll help you.

1017
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:07,270

1018
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,170
Do you need more time?

1019
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:09,670
No?

1020
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,820
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

1021
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,860
OK, we've got many A's.

1022
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,460
That's great.

1023
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,690

1024
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,550
So if it's the case
that the parasite,

1025
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,360
regardless of how rapidly
it's killing the individual,

1026
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,220
has the same rate of getting
to other individuals,

1027
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:37,220
then we want to make the R0
to get as large as possible.

1028
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,134
So then, we make v go
as small as possible.

1029
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:42,050
That's the mathematical
thing you can look at.

1030
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,350
And why does this make sense?

1031
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:51,093

1032
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:52,592
AUDIENCE: You're
killing people off,

1033
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:54,089
and you're infecting
most people.

1034
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:55,090
But--

1035
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1036
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,480
So from the standpoint
of the parasite,

1037
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,190
in this situation where the
infectivity doesn't depend

1038
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,080
on the virulence,
well in that case,

1039
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,570
you don't want to
kill your host.

1040
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,530
Because the longer
that the host lives,

1041
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,380
the more other individuals
you can infect.

1042
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,060

1043
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:19,310
And this is the basic statement
underlying the statement

1044
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,960
you often hear that a
well-adapted parasite does not

1045
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,236
harm its host.

1046
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:26,860
And I think this is
one of those things

1047
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,620
that you can write
down a simple model

1048
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,390
and convince yourself
it should be true.

1049
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,360
You can maybe find
a few case studies

1050
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,180
where it seems to be true.

1051
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,179
But then, you always have to be
careful about how strongly you

1052
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,720
should believe such
a statement based

1053
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,110
on those kinds of evidence.

1054
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,500
Because it's a
very simple model.

1055
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,770
It's making an assumption
that is very likely not true

1056
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,130
and, actually, many assumptions
that are very likely not true.

1057
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,710
And there are counterexamples.

1058
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,590
So Martin talks
about malaria, which

1059
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,110
humans have had for
millions of years,

1060
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:05,450
and still causes
a lot of problems.

1061
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,950
And so you might
imagine, what would

1062
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:11,510
happen if the infectivity is
a function of the virulence?

1063
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,960
Maybe it's just proportional
to the virulence.

1064
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,850
And this kind of
would make sense.

1065
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:19,590
Because you say, oh well,
let's imagine that the number

1066
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:25,560
of viruses in the host--
that somehow, the virulence

1067
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,070
is proportional to that number.

1068
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:30,182
And also, the infectivity is
proportional to that number.

1069
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:31,640
In that case,
infectivity will just

1070
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:38,330
scale linearly with v. It's kind
of another reasonable world.

1071
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,540
So in this situation, where
does the virulence evolve to?

1072
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,700
We'll think about
this for 10 seconds.

1073
00:51:44,700 --> 00:52:01,100

1074
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,660
Ready?

1075
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,480
Three, two, one.

1076
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:11,130

1077
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,780
All right, so now we
actually have votes that

1078
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,010
are pretty distributed around.

1079
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,310

1080
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,880
OK, I'm just going to
write down the expression.

1081
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,720
Just because I think
we can do it quickly.

1082
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,399
So now, the R0 is going
to be given by-- we're

1083
00:52:27,399 --> 00:52:28,690
going to be thinking about a 1.

1084
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,120
There's a u plus v down here.

1085
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,730
But beta-- we're going
to put beta here.

1086
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:39,173
This is an a times v,
and then a k over u.

1087
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:41,140
Right?

1088
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:46,161
So if we plot this as a function
of v, what does it look like?

1089
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:47,862
AUDIENCE: It
monotonically increases.

1090
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:49,320
PROFESSOR:
Monotonically increases.

1091
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,420
This is a
Michaelis-Menten type form

1092
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,680
where the R0 is a function
of v. It starts out

1093
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,885
linear and, then, saturates.

1094
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:04,170

1095
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,770
Oops, this is not v. This is R0.

1096
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,540

1097
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:14,706
If we want to maximize R0,
then v goes to infinity, right?

1098
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:20,060

1099
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,430
There was one other model
that Martin talked about,

1100
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,745
which was the situation
if the infectivity itself.

1101
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:28,550
It had a kind of
Michealis-Menten type form.

1102
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,390
And we still have an a there.

1103
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:38,630
So it's some a,v c plus v. So
this would be the situation

1104
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,360
where, initially, the
infectivity increases with

1105
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,870
virulence.

1106
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,110
But beyond some
virulence, you no longer

1107
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,484
get an increase in infectivity.

1108
00:53:47,484 --> 00:53:49,650
So for example, if it's the
case that every time you

1109
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,884
sneeze on somebody you're
going to infect them,

1110
00:53:51,884 --> 00:53:54,300
then it doesn't matter if you
double the number of viruses

1111
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,966
you have.

1112
00:53:54,966 --> 00:53:56,590
You've still saturated
the infectivity.

1113
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:00,700

1114
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:07,400
Now, I'll just tell
you that, in this case,

1115
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,540
there ends up being some
intermediate infectivity

1116
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,850
that you evolve to,
which comes here.

1117
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,750
And indeed, this makes sense.

1118
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:31,590
As c goes to infinity,
so if c is very large,

1119
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:34,217
then it just looks like this.

1120
00:54:34,217 --> 00:54:35,550
It's divided by something large.

1121
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,530
But in terms of the scaling
with v, it's just linear in v.

1122
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:42,670
And that means that the evolved
virulence goes very large.

1123
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,575

1124
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,850
Does that make sense?

1125
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,350
No?

1126
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,320
OK.

1127
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,560
So I guess what I'm
saying is that, if you're

1128
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:00,120
in the region where c is
somehow very large, then

1129
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,080
you end up with the
infectivity just being

1130
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,700
proportional to the virulence.

1131
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,580
Because the virulence, the
v here in the denominator,

1132
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,510
doesn't really
contribute very much.

1133
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:12,076
And that means that it's
going to be the same kind

1134
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,200
of functional form as this.

1135
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,670
Except if it's a divided by c.

1136
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,950
But it's still proportional
to the virulence.

1137
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:21,772
And that leads to a larger
and larger evolved virulence.

1138
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:24,240
OK?

1139
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,890
Yep?

1140
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:25,390
Yes?

1141
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,471
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to say something

1142
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:32,894
in actual infection,
what the data is?

1143
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:33,872
Is it virulunce?

1144
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,880
Or can you [INAUDIBLE]--

1145
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,546
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1146
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:37,296
AUDIENCE: --other than
just these verbal--

1147
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:38,600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

1148
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,160
So I think, from real data, I
think people do argue about it.

1149
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:52,180
But I think it seems to be
there is some sense that it

1150
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,020
does plateau.

1151
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,460
But it's an increasing
function of v, but sub-linear.

1152
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,729
And the question is how
strong of a statement

1153
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:01,520
you can make there.

1154
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,769
Because also, in many cases,
there is super-infection.

1155
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:07,460
And super-infection tends to
lead to even higher virulence

1156
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,510
than what you would
expect from this.

1157
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:14,340
Because you're competing against
viruses in the same host.

1158
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,570
So you have to out-compete the
other parasite in the host,

1159
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,340
as well as go on.

1160
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,260
And you don't pay the
full cost associated

1161
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,210
with keeping the host alive.

1162
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:26,710
So when you have
super-infection,

1163
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,981
there's this notion that
the better strategy,

1164
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:31,480
from the standpoint
of the parasite,

1165
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,336
can be to just evolve
very high virulence.

1166
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:35,710
So you're going
to kill the host.

1167
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,340
But you can get out quickly.

1168
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,170
So then, you can imagine
that the less-virulent strain

1169
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,380
was kind of stranded
in that host that died.

1170
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,770
So from that standpoint,
you can think about,

1171
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,650
in some cases, for
a parasite, evolving

1172
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,620
low-virulence is somehow like
some cooperative behavior.

1173
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,810
Because you're keeping
this host alive.

1174
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,010
You're using the
resources in a wise way,

1175
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,240
so that you can infect
other individuals.

1176
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,356
But then, that
kind of strategy is

1177
00:57:03,356 --> 00:57:05,230
susceptible to these
cheating strategies that

1178
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,340
just have high virulence
and kill the host

1179
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,645
and, then, get on to a new host.

1180
00:57:09,645 --> 00:57:11,730
Yeah, so I think there
are enough of these issues

1181
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,370
that it's hard to take
any of this too seriously.

1182
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,590
I would say that,
perhaps, where this field

1183
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,375
has had the biggest impact is
in the context of vaccinations.

1184
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:30,000

1185
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,840
Because you can really measure
R0 for many different diseases.

1186
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,430
And I think that's
somehow easier

1187
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,846
to measure than
many other things.

1188
00:57:37,846 --> 00:57:42,700
Because you can try to
do tracing of infections.

1189
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,620
So if you think about
somebody that gets infected

1190
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,040
and moves to a new city
or lands in a new city,

1191
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,840
you can try to figure
out who they infected.

1192
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,250
So then, you can go and
measure these R0 parameters.

1193
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,410
And of course, the diseases
that we worry about

1194
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,810
tend to have R0s larger than 1.

1195
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,630
And how large they are tells
you about how difficult

1196
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:09,470
the vaccination will be
in order to be successful

1197
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,800
and to remove the disease
from the population.

1198
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,520
So if you're curious, after
class, you can come up.

1199
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,550
And there's a nice
table that I have here

1200
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,550
for smallpox, measles,
whooping cough, German measles,

1201
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,881
chickenpox, diphtheria,
scarlet fever, mumps,

1202
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:24,630
and poliomielitis.

1203
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,240

1204
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:34,456
Estimates of R0s-- and
they kind of range 5 to 15,

1205
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:36,680
to give you a sense.

1206
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,820
And so, if you want
to remove the disease

1207
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,300
from the population,
what is it that changes?

1208
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,230
--in terms of vaccination, in
order to remove the disease.

1209
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:55,260

1210
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:55,760
Yes?

1211
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,586
AUDIENCE: In R0, then,
the [INAUDIBLE] for u,

1212
00:58:58,586 --> 00:59:02,230
as the population
available [INAUDIBLE].

1213
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,230
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1214
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,189
So by vaccinating
you're removing

1215
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:08,980
susceptible individuals
from the population

1216
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,420
and making them
resistant somehow.

1217
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,670
And the R0 parameter tells
you about what fraction

1218
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,670
of the population you
have to vaccinate in order

1219
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,830
to remove the parasite
from the population.

1220
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:23,230
And so, basically,
you have to vaccinate

1221
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:29,000
a fraction, a percentage, p
that's greater than 1 minus 1

1222
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,630
over R0.

1223
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,850
So as R0 gets very
large, it means

1224
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:37,770
that you have to vaccinate,
essentially, everybody.

1225
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,787
So if you have R0
of, say, five--

1226
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,620
which is typical of
many of these diseases--

1227
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,170
it's saying you
have to vaccinate

1228
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,260
80% of the population.

1229
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,084
You can never get to 100%.

1230
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,500
And that's why
it's very difficult

1231
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,860
to get rid of these
diseases with large R0s.

1232
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:58,730
And incidentally, they note that
smallpox has an R0 of 3 to 5.

1233
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,330

1234
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,960
And this always depends
on the environment.

1235
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,420
But in the case
where they measured,

1236
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,380
smallpox R0 is 3 to 5.

1237
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,027
And this is sort of
small, as compared

1238
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:13,110
to many of these diseases.

1239
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:17,660
And this is telling us
that smallpox is easier

1240
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,360
to get rid of via
vaccinations than many

1241
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,360
of these other diseases.

1242
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,940
And indeed, the
vaccination procedures

1243
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,882
have been more successful
in smallpox than the others.

1244
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:31,740
AUDIENCE: Do you
know what is 3, 4?

1245
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,750
PROFESSOR: I don't.

1246
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,070
But maybe in the
next 20 minutes,

1247
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,580
somebody can Google this.

1248
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,450
We can estimate this
right now, though.

1249
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,840
We've had, what?

1250
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,710
--five Ebola patients
come to the United States.

1251
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,470
And we've gotten two
or three infections.

1252
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,815
So I'll say, 3/5.

1253
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,342
[LAUGHTER]

1254
01:00:53,342 --> 01:00:55,300
It obviously depends on
the environment, right?

1255
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1256
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,665
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1257
01:00:57,665 --> 01:00:59,623
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess
that was my question.

1258
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:01,449
You're not going to
take someone with Ebola

1259
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:05,097
and throw them in New York
City and just measure how

1260
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:06,235
many people they infect.

1261
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:06,690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1262
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,145
AUDIENCE: So--

1263
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:08,060
AUDIENCE: That would
be [INAUDIBLE].

1264
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,005
AUDIENCE: Like--

1265
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:09,921
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1266
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:12,327
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
the thing is, you

1267
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:14,160
don't have to do anything
that's so immoral.

1268
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,630
Because what you're
interested in

1269
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,309
is the R0 for individual
in an actual environment

1270
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:19,850
that they're actually
going to be in.

1271
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,210
So this is a situation where the
doctor comes back from Africa

1272
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,170
after working with
Doctors Without Borders.

1273
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,704
In this day and age, he knows
that he has to watch out

1274
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:30,620
for a fever, da-da-da.

1275
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,910
And then, if he gets
a fever, he calls in.

1276
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,440
And he's brought
to the hospital.

1277
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,240
And that's the world that
we're interested in of what

1278
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,950
the R0 is.

1279
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,050
It's not the world in which
there's fevers everywhere

1280
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,470
and nobody knows.

1281
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,280
So the R0 in the
United States is

1282
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,108
going to be much lower
than the R0 somewhere else.

1283
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:51,056
Yeah?

1284
01:01:51,056 --> 01:01:53,599
AUDIENCE: Is there enough
of R0 for a disease that you

1285
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,848
don't transmit between people?

1286
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,952
You get malaria of the plague--

1287
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:57,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

1288
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:03,024
So I think that you could try
to generate a similar kind of R0

1289
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:03,940
for those to diseases.

1290
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,990
Although, it's going
to be very muddled,

1291
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,540
in the case of where you have
all the vectors and so forth.

1292
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,830
Because it's not
even clear-- yeah,

1293
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,360
I'm hesitant to say too much.

1294
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,736
Because I don't know anything.

1295
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,155
AUDIENCE: According
to Wikipedia,

1296
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:23,315
it's like 1.5 to 2.5.

1297
01:02:23,315 --> 01:02:24,190
PROFESSOR: For Ebola?

1298
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:24,550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1299
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:25,216
PROFESSOR: Here?

1300
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:26,522
Or in--

1301
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:31,076
AUDIENCE: It says the 2014
West Africa aggregate.

1302
01:02:31,076 --> 01:02:33,876
PROFESSOR: Ah, so this
is in West Africa then.

1303
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:34,750
AUDIENCE: Apparently.

1304
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,458
PROFESSOR: Right.

1305
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,460
Yeah And it has obviously
spread exponentially,

1306
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,779
which means it had to
have been larger than 1.

1307
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:43,320
And I think it's important to
remember that, just because you

1308
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,130
have a chart with a bunch of
R0s, this is not set in stone.

1309
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,640
Public policy, hygiene, and
everything changes this.

1310
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,850
And we'd like to drive it down.

1311
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,258
Was there a question
in the back?

1312
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:56,620
AUDIENCE: I just was
going to say about two.

1313
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,995
PROFESSOR: Same
thing, about two.

1314
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:02,170
OK, so that means that we
could actually, in principle,

1315
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,950
vaccinate against Ebola.

1316
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,580
We'd only have to get over 50%
of the population vaccinated

1317
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,230
in West Africa.

1318
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:11,940
And then, we can maybe make it
so it cannot spread and become

1319
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,750
an epidemic.

1320
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,434
Of course, we need to
have a vaccine first.

1321
01:03:17,434 --> 01:03:19,046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1322
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,670
PROFESSOR: So I think
I'm going to skip

1323
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,350
the discussion of SIR models.

1324
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,670
Because you are going to
play with some of them

1325
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,140
in the context of
your problem set.

1326
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,180
And if you just Google
SIR, you can find it.

1327
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,712
And a very similar
kind of intuition

1328
01:03:31,712 --> 01:03:32,920
that you get from this model.

1329
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,895

1330
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,270
Because I do want to spend
the last 15 minutes, at least,

1331
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:39,728
talking about the
evolution of sex.

1332
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:41,850
Because it is an
interesting topic.

1333
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:47,126
And I think the paper is
a nice discussion of it.

1334
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:54,920

1335
01:03:54,920 --> 01:04:00,540
So can somebody say why it is
that this is a puzzle at all?

1336
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:11,408

1337
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:13,813
Yeah?

1338
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,854
AUDIENCE: In almost all
the situations we imagine

1339
01:04:15,854 --> 01:04:19,806
and things that can be
[INAUDIBLE] introduce much

1340
01:04:19,806 --> 01:04:21,501
faster, even violating
the [INAUDIBLE]--

1341
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:22,500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1342
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,634
AUDIENCE: --80%
[INAUDIBLE] right?

1343
01:04:25,634 --> 01:04:29,130
PROFESSOR: So sex is costly,
and in particular, if you have

1344
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:33,130
this obligate bi-parental sex.

1345
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:37,795
In particular, there's
the so-called twofold cost

1346
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:38,295
of males.

1347
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:41,670

1348
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,200
Because you can imagine
comparing these two

1349
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,660
populations, one of which
has both males and females.

1350
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:51,984
And one of them is just,
maybe, reproducing asexually,

1351
01:04:51,984 --> 01:04:53,900
or parthenogenetically,
or hermaphroditically,

1352
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,310
or what not.

1353
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,810
And so, if you have
a male and a female,

1354
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,570
then on average, if
they have two kids,

1355
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,999
you end up with another
male and a female.

1356
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,040
And of course, this could
be many different males

1357
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:06,539
and females.

1358
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:08,990
So you don't have to have
any sibling anything.

1359
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:15,125
But if, every
generation, each female

1360
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,610
is giving birth to
two progeny, then you

1361
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,610
end up with a constant
population size.

1362
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,970
Whereas, if you started
out in a population

1363
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,950
with just two females
and they were reproducing

1364
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:32,290
hermaphroditically, then you
end up with-- whatever-- more.

1365
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:33,660
8.

1366
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,650
So you can see that
you get a factor of 2

1367
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:38,096
in the rate of exponential
growth of the population.

1368
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:38,596
Yeah?

1369
01:05:38,596 --> 01:05:41,054
AUDIENCE: Well, it seems to me
the question is not why sex,

1370
01:05:41,054 --> 01:05:42,932
but it's why males.

1371
01:05:42,932 --> 01:05:44,670
Right, I mean--

1372
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,010
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1373
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:52,150
So I think this is the
most extreme cost of sex.

1374
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,400
But then, also, you can
think about even just

1375
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,730
horizontal gene-transfer
among bacteria.

1376
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:59,740
It's a costly behavior
in some way or another.

1377
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,010
It's not as costly as this.

1378
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:05,670
But if you're going to
think about bacteria

1379
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,440
in their competence state,
when B. subtilis kind of pulls

1380
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,630
in DNA, it stops dividing.

1381
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,930
And then, it enters a state
where it reels things in.

1382
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:17,530
And it can pick up DNA that
may be harmful in some cases.

1383
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:23,042
So there are various costs
for, if you want to call it,

1384
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,250
horizontal gene-transfer sex.

1385
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,970

1386
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,100
So the key thing of
sexual reproduction

1387
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,020
is it somehow is the
sharing of the DNA.

1388
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,730
And I'd say that this can
either be relatively low cost

1389
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,739
or relatively high cost.

1390
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:39,530
But this is the most
extreme version of it.

1391
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:44,560
And I'd say, as a
species that reproduces

1392
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,520
with obligate
bi-parental sex, then

1393
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:52,770
I'd say that, not only
humans, but almost all animals

1394
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,500
have this form of reproduction.

1395
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,420
I would say it's
sort of surprising,

1396
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,130
given that this is a huge cost.

1397
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:01,484

1398
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,900
But it's not that
all species that

1399
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,480
engage in any sort
of gene-transfer

1400
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,190
bear this large of a cost.

1401
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,100
But they bear more modest costs.

1402
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,410
AUDIENCE: Well, although,
other species do-- even

1403
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,310
with this [INAUDIBLE],
it's like having

1404
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,668
multiple children per sex.

1405
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,126
PROFESSOR: You're saying that
they can just have more kids.

1406
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:21,980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean--

1407
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, although the
basic statement is still true.

1408
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,349
Let's say that these
females all have three kids.

1409
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:27,640
They get to grow exponentially.

1410
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,210
But then, these
guys grow faster.

1411
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,793
And ultimately, there's going
to be competition for resources.

1412
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:33,575
And these ones will still win.

1413
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:34,200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1414
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,674
PROFESSOR: So the
question is-- you

1415
01:07:35,674 --> 01:07:37,340
can imagine you have
a population that's

1416
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,480
reproducing sexually-- if one
female has a mutation that

1417
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,744
leads her to start
reproducing parthogenetically,

1418
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:45,410
that mutation you'd
expect should spread

1419
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,900
throughout the
population very rapidly.

1420
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,550
And indeed, there are these
cases of, for example,

1421
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,950
sharks held in captivity
where a female held

1422
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,370
in captivity for years
eventually gives birth

1423
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,925
to daughters.

1424
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:02,780

1425
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,100
So this sort of virgin
birth is possible.

1426
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,275
I'm not aware-- well, I'm
not going to talk about--

1427
01:08:07,275 --> 01:08:08,280
[LAUGHTER]

1428
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,730

1429
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:15,520
But in some animals, it is
at least possible, I'll say.

1430
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,870
So then, you have
to ask, well, what

1431
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:22,220
kind of selective advantage
could sexual reproduction have

1432
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:25,460
that could possibly compensate
for this so-called twofold cost

1433
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,727
of sex or twofold cost of males?

1434
01:08:27,727 --> 01:08:30,910

1435
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:36,120
And what is the argument
that's made in this paper?

1436
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:54,220

1437
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:54,720
Anybody?

1438
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,828

1439
01:08:58,828 --> 01:08:59,780
Yes?

1440
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,588
AUDIENCE: The recombination
favors genetic diversity.

1441
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:04,910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1442
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,880
This recombination is
favoring genetic diversity.

1443
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,260
So there are a number
of different mechanisms.

1444
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,399
I'd say that at the heart of
this idea of the Red Queen

1445
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,330
hypothesis is-- let
me see if I can find

1446
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,060
the actual quote for you guys.

1447
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:21,700
Maybe not.

1448
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,229

1449
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:26,840
So it's from a
Lewis Carroll novel,

1450
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,290
Through the Looking Glass.

1451
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,845
The quote was something--
run-- oh, shoot.

1452
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:37,370

1453
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,740
Never mind, I can't
remember what the quote was.

1454
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,010
But the idea is that
sexual reproduction

1455
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:46,830
may allow a population
to adapt against, say,

1456
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,830
changing environments
more rapidly.

1457
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,580
And this has a
couple of reasons.

1458
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,910
Because you generate
genetic diversity.

1459
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:56,565
You don't have the same
clonal interference effects

1460
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:58,650
that we talked about earlier.

1461
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,780
So if you have asexual
lineages, then,

1462
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,640
if you have two
beneficial mutations,

1463
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,960
they cannot both fix.

1464
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,647
So the more fit version
is going to fix.

1465
01:10:06,647 --> 01:10:08,480
And then, you have to
wait for the next one.

1466
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,360
Whereas, in sexually
reproducing populations,

1467
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,240
those genes can spread
throughout the population,

1468
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,390
sort of as genes,
rather than being tied

1469
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,007
to a particular individual.

1470
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:20,590
So that means that, if you find
yourself in a new environment,

1471
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,140
it may be the case that
sexual reproduction can

1472
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,670
allow for the population
to adapt more rapidly.

1473
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,671
But on one hand, you might say,
well, the environment's always

1474
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:29,170
changing.

1475
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:31,030
So that can always favor
the sexually reproducing

1476
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,550
populations.

1477
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,680
But then, there's
a feeling out there

1478
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,760
that maybe that's not
enough, in the sense

1479
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,800
that the environment
is not changing

1480
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,520
rapidly enough and
dramatically enough

1481
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,880
to force the population to
reproduce sexually as compared

1482
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,270
to asexually.

1483
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:49,040
And so, the proposal from
the Red Queen Hypothesis

1484
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,060
is that the constantly
changing environment

1485
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,870
is a result of
co-evolution between hosts

1486
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,930
and their parasites.

1487
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:01,650
Because parasites are always
trying to target common host

1488
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:02,180
genotypes.

1489
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,490
Because they can
spread on those.

1490
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,140
So the parasites are evolving.

1491
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,860
And then, the host
populations or genotypes

1492
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,570
are kind of being chased
away by those parasites that

1493
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:12,860
are targeting them.

1494
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,120
So the notion is that
parasites, as a result

1495
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,800
of this co-evolution, can be
the source for the constantly

1496
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,440
changing environment that may
be driving the evolution of sex.

1497
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:23,940
Yeah?

1498
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,910
AUDIENCE: And this, proportional
with [INAUDIBLE], bacteria

1499
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:30,870
also get parasites [INAUDIBLE].

1500
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,899
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1501
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:35,800
AUDIENCE: So--

1502
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,440
PROFESSOR: Yes, so is
the question is why--

1503
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,530
AUDIENCE: Why only in multi--

1504
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,260
PROFESSOR: Right.

1505
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,690
So I can give you my
best guess on this.

1506
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:49,090
First of all, not everybody
agrees that the Red Queen

1507
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:52,200
Hypothesis is the
true explanation,

1508
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,730
if a true explanation
even exists.

1509
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:58,120
But within this
framework, you definitely

1510
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:04,030
want to try to explain why it
is that large life forms seem

1511
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,350
to have a lot of obligate
sexual reproduction.

1512
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:08,711
Because this is a very
strong pattern that you see.

1513
01:12:08,711 --> 01:12:10,960
And I guess what I would say
is that there's certainly

1514
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:17,620
a correlation between physical
size and generation time.

1515
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,490
And generation time
tells you something

1516
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,130
about the typical time scales
over which you can evolve.

1517
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,920
So my sense of this
is it just maybe

1518
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,190
that, in general, large
animals, by their nature,

1519
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,552
will evolve rather slowly as
compared to their parasites.

1520
01:12:32,552 --> 01:12:34,760
And so, that means that they
are the populations that

1521
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,200
are most in need of
speeding up their evolution.

1522
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,180
And it's hard to know how
convincing that argument

1523
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:44,680
should be.

1524
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,640
But-- yes?

1525
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,922
AUDIENCE: What's the difference
in reproductive productive time

1526
01:12:52,922 --> 01:12:55,916
between phage and bacteria?

1527
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,912
Like, how fast does phage--

1528
01:12:57,912 --> 01:12:59,120
PROFESSOR: Right.

1529
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,230
So bacteria can--
as we've discussed,

1530
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,870
division times are order hour.

1531
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:11,410
And phage-- when you get a
phage infection, what happens

1532
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,250
is that the phage you can
infect as a single phage.

1533
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:21,130
And then, they will divide
within the bacterial cell

1534
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:24,986
and then burst out as
a population of 100,

1535
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,890
200-- typical of phage.

1536
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:30,800
And I think that that
might take four or five

1537
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,240
hours, is kind of my sense.

1538
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,000

1539
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,180
And then, they go off and
they find new bacteria.

1540
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:42,181
So in that sense, it's a little
bit faster than the bacteria,

1541
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:42,681
I'd say.

1542
01:13:42,681 --> 01:13:49,070

1543
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:52,320
So can somebody say what the
core experiment was that they

1544
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,670
did in this experiment?

1545
01:13:53,670 --> 01:14:15,538

1546
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,029
Yes?

1547
01:14:17,029 --> 01:14:25,975
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and one time,

1548
01:14:25,975 --> 01:14:29,951
it was reproducing
asexually when they always

1549
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:31,442
produce sexually.

1550
01:14:31,442 --> 01:14:33,001
And the other time,
it was dividing.

1551
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1552
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,232
So this worm, C. Elegans--
sort of a millimeter in size--

1553
01:14:40,232 --> 01:14:42,440
and there are going to be
three different conditions.

1554
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:51,270
One is the wild type that can
out-cross, can have males mate.

1555
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:54,510
Then, there's the
obligate out-crossing,

1556
01:14:54,510 --> 01:15:00,310
which means they have
to mate with males.

1557
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:03,950
And then, there's the--
what did they call it?

1558
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,759

1559
01:15:06,759 --> 01:15:07,550
--obligate selfing.

1560
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:13,505

1561
01:15:13,505 --> 01:15:14,005
OK.

1562
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:18,870

1563
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:23,146
And then, what they
do with those worms?

1564
01:15:23,146 --> 01:15:25,122
AUDIENCE: They put
them right back

1565
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:31,121
to [INAUDIBLE] more typical.

1566
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:32,120
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1567
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:37,360
So then, there's a bacterial
pathogen, Serratia marcescens.

1568
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,610
And they're going to have these
three different conditions.

1569
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:45,300
For the SM, the
bacteria, they're

1570
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:51,520
either going to allow
for co-evolution, where

1571
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,670
they take the bacteria
from each of the infections

1572
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,940
and propagate.

1573
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:00,180
Or they're going to do the
no evolution, where you just

1574
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,060
compete against the ancestor.

1575
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,190
And there's also a control.

1576
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,720
So there's co-evolution.

1577
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,544
There's this no evolution
of the bacteria.

1578
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:10,960
And then, there's also control,
where there's no bacteria.

1579
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:17,246

1580
01:16:17,246 --> 01:16:18,745
And what was the
most striking thing

1581
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:20,120
that they saw in
this experiment?

1582
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:28,825

1583
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:32,290
AUDIENCE: I guess I would
say that the obligate-selfing

1584
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:33,990
population died in evolution.

1585
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,020
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1586
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:39,140
So if you allowed the
bacteria to be evolving,

1587
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,659
against this obligately
selfing population,

1588
01:16:44,659 --> 01:16:45,575
this killed the worms.

1589
01:16:45,575 --> 01:16:48,740

1590
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,430
And what was the
other thing that

1591
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:55,060
was, maybe, very striking
about their experiment?

1592
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,530
Yeah.

1593
01:16:56,530 --> 01:17:00,889
AUDIENCE: The worms that did
the out-cross or self increased.

1594
01:17:00,889 --> 01:17:01,430
[INAUDIBLE]--

1595
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this
was kind of amazing.

1596
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:06,130
So they saw, as a
function of time,

1597
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:10,400
if you look at out-crossing--
the rate of mating

1598
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,340
with the males-- this
started out at, like, 0.2.

1599
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:19,130
And then, in the presence of
the co-evolution, it went up.

1600
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,510
And it goes up to, maybe, 80%.

1601
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,760

1602
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,470
And for co-evolution,
it stayed up high.

1603
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:35,250
Whereas, if the
wild-type worms continued

1604
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,780
to be just challenged by
the ancestral bacteria,

1605
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,890
it initially came up.

1606
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:41,324
But then, it came back down.

1607
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:42,490
So this is the co-evolution.

1608
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,340

1609
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:51,950
And this is the ancestral SM.

1610
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,205
So there was a sense that
that wild-type population

1611
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:57,040
had initially evolved
to out-cross more.

1612
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
But then, once it had
solved this problem of how

1613
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,249
to handle the
ancestral Serratia,

1614
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:02,790
the out-crossing
rate went back down.

1615
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,450

1616
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,550
So we are pretty
much out of time.

1617
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,869
But I don't know
if you guys noticed

1618
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,160
the last sentence of the paper.

1619
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,405
It is amazing that they got
this through the publication

1620
01:18:15,405 --> 01:18:15,905
process.

1621
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:18,810

1622
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,100
All right, so they
say, "taken together,

1623
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:24,150
the results demonstrate that
sex can facilitate adaptation

1624
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,700
to novel environments.

1625
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,620
But the long-term
maintenance of sex

1626
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,396
requires that the novelty
does not wear off."

1627
01:18:30,396 --> 01:18:31,870
[LAUGHTER]

1628
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:36,310
It's one of those things that
you read and you think-- OK.

1629
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,570
So I will leave that
sentence with you.

1630
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:43,670
And then, we'll
meet on Tuesday, OK?
