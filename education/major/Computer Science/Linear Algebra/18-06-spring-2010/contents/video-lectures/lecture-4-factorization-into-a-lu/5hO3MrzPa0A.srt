1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are we ready?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, ready for me to start.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ready for the taping to start
in a minute.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He's going to raise his hand
and signal when I'm on.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Just a minute,
though, let them settle.0

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, guys.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, give me the signal,
then, when you want me to

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
start.
Okay, this is linear algebra,
lecture four.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And, the first thing I have to
do is something that was on the

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
list for last time,
but here it is now.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's the inverse of a
product?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If I multiply two matrices
together and I know their

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
inverses, how do I get the
inverse of A times B?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I know what inverses mean
for a single matrix A and for a

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
matrix B.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What matrix do I multiply by to
get the identity if I have A B?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,190
Okay, that'll be simple but so
basic.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,870
Then I'm going to use that to
-- I will have a product of

19
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,000
matrices and the product that
we'll meet will be these

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
elimination matrices and the net
result of today's lectures is

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the big formula for elimination,
so the net result of today's

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
lecture is this great way to
look at Gaussian elimination.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We know that we get from A to U
by elimination.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We know the steps -- but now we
get the right way to look at it,

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A equals L U.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that's the high point for
today.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can I take the easy part,
the first step first?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, suppose A is invertible --
and of course it's going to be a

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
big question,
when is the matrix invertible?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But let's say A is invertible
and B is invertible,

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then what matrix gives me the
inverse of A B?

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So that's the direct question.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's the inverse of A B?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do I multiply those separate
inverses?

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.
I multiply the two matrices A
inverse and B inverse,

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but what order do I multiply?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In reverse order.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And you see why.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So the right thing to put here
is B inverse A inverse.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the inverse I'm after.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We can just check that A B
times that matrix gives the

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
identity.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So why -- once again,
it's this fact that I can move

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
parentheses around.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can just erase them all and
do the multiplications any way I

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
want to.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,490
So what's the right
multiplication to do first?

50
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,100
B times B inverse.

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,000
This product here I is the
identity.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,510
Then A times the identity is
the identity and then finally A

53
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,000
times A inverse gives the
identity.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So forgive the dumb example in
the book.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,010
Why do you, do the inverse
things in reverse order?

56
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:15,000
It's just like -- you take off
your shoes, you take off your

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
socks, then the good way to
invert that process is socks

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
back on first,
then shoes.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sorry, okay.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry that's on the tape.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And, of course,
on the other side we should

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
really just check -- on the
other side I have B inverse,

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A inverse.
That does multiply A B,
and this time it's these guys

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that give the identity,
squeeze down,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
they give the identity,
we're in shape.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.
So there's the inverse.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good.
While we're at it,
let me do a transpose,

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
because the next lecture has
got a lot to -- involves

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
transposes.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So how do I -- if I transpose a
matrix,

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm talking about square,
invertible matrices right now.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If I transpose one,
what's its inverse?

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, the nice formula is --
let's see.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let me start from A,
A inverse equal the identity.
So -- give me a first row.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And let me transpose both
sides.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That will bring a transpose
into the picture.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So if I transpose the identity
matrix, what do I have?

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The identity,
right?

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,470
If I exchange rows and columns,
the identity is a symmetric

80
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,000
matrix.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It doesn't know the difference.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If I transpose these guys,
that product,

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
then again it turns out that I
have to reverse the order.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can transpose them
separately, but when I multiply,

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
those transposes come in the
opposite order.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's A inverse transpose
times A transpose giving the

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,680
identity.

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
So that's -- this equation is
-- just comes directly from that

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
one.
But this equation tells me what
I wanted to know,

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
namely what is the inverse of
this guy A transpose?

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,730
What's the inverse of that --
if I transpose a matrix,

92
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,000
what'ss the inverse of the
result?

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And this equation tells me that
here it is.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is the inverse of A
transpose.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Inverse of A transpose.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Of A transpose.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I'll put a big circle around
that, because that's the answer,

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
that's the best answer we could
hope for.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That if you want to know the
inverse of A transpose and you

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
know the inverse of A,
then you just transpose that.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So in a -- to put it another
way, transposing and inversing

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
you can do in either order for a
single matrix.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.
So these are like basic facts
that we can now use,

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,540
all right -- so now I put it to
use.

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,470
I put it to use by thinking --
we're really completing,

106
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,000
the subject of elimination.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,140
Actually, -- the thing about
elimination is it's the right

108
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,000
way to understand what the
matrix has got.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This A equal L U is the most
basic factorization of a matrix.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I always worry that you will
think this course is all

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
elimination.

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's just row operations.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And please don't.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We'll be beyond that,
but it's the right algebra to

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
do first.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay.
So, now I'm coming near the end
of it, but I want to get it in a

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
decent form.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,600
So my decent form is matrix
form.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,000
I have a matrix A,
let's suppose it's a good

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
matrix, I can do elimination,
no row exchanges --

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So no row exchanges for now.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Pivots all fine,
nothing zero in the pivot

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,250
position.

124
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,000
I get to the very end,
which is U.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I get from A to U.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,350
And I want to know what's the
connection?

127
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,000
How is A related to U?

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,640
And this is going to tell me
that there's a matrix L that

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
connects them.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,660
Okay.

131
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,000
Can I do it for a two by two
first?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.
Two by two, elimination.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, so I'll do it under here.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So let my matrix A be --
We'll keep it simple,

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
say two and an eight,
so we know that the first pivot

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
is a two, and the multiplier's
going to be a four and then let

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
me put a one here and what
number do I not want to put

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
there?

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Four.
I don't want a four there,
because in that case,

141
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,000
the second pivot would not --
we wouldn't have a second

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,890
pivot.

143
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,000
The matrix would be singular,
general screw-up.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So let me put some other number
here like seven.

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.
Now I want to operate on that
with my elementary matrix.

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So what's the elementary
matrix?

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Strictly speaking,
it's E21, because it's the guy

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that's going to produce a zero
in that position.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And it's going to produce U in
one shot, because it's just a

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
two by two matrix.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,460
So two one and I'm going to
take four of those away from

154
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,390
those, produce that zero and
leave a three there.

155
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,000
And that's U.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And what's the matrix that did
it?

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Quick review,
then.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's the elimination
elementary matrix E21 -- it's

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
one zero, thanks.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And --
negative four one,

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
right.
Good.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.
So that -- you see the
difference between this and what

163
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm shooting for.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm shooting for A on one side
and the other matrices on the

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
other side of the equation.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I can do that right away.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now here's going to be my A
equals L U.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And you won't have any trouble
telling me what -- so A is still

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
two one eight seven.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
L is what you're going to tell
me and U is still two one zero

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
three.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.
So what's L in this case?

174
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, first -- so how is L
related to this E guy?

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's the inverse,
because I want to multiply

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
through by the inverse of this,
which will put the identity

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
here, and the inverse will show
up there and I'll call it L.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So what is the inverse of this?

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Remember those elimination
matrices are easy to invert.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The inverse matrix for this one
is 1 0 4 1, it's actually flip

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
sign.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.
Do you want -- if we did the
numbers right,

183
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,000
we must -- this should be
correct.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay.
And of course it is.

185
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That says the first row's
right, four times the first row

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
plus the second row is eight
seven.

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
Good.

188
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's simple,
two by two.

190
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But it already shows the form
that we're headed for.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,450
It shows -- so what's the L
stand for?

192
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,000
Why the letter L?

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If U stood for upper
triangular, then of course L

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
stands for lower triangular.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And actually,
it has ones on the diagonal,

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
where this thing has the pivots
on the diagonal.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, sometimes we may want to
separate out the pivots,

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
so can I just mention that
sometimes we could also write

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
this as -- we could have this
one zero four one -- I'll just

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
show you how I would divide out
this matrix of pivots -- two

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
three.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's a diagonal matrix.

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I just -- whatever is left
is here.

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Now what's left?

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If I divide this first row by
two to pull out the two,

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
then I have a one and a one
half.

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And if I divide the second row
by three to pull out the three,

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
then I have a one.

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So if this is L U,
this is maybe called L D or

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,050
pivot U.

211
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,000
And now it's a little more
balanced, because we have ones

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
on the diagonal here and here.

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,090
And the diagonal matrix in the
middle.

214
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,000
So both of those...

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Matlab would produce either
one.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll basically stay with L U.

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Now I have to think about
bigger than two by two.

219
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But right now,
this was just like easy

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
exercise.

221
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And, to tell the truth,
this one was a minus sign and

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
this one was a plus sign.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I mean, that's the only
difference.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But, with three by three,
there's a more significant

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
difference.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let me show you how that works.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let me move up to a three by
three, let's say some matrix A,

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,030
okay?

229
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's imagine it's three by
three.

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I won't write numbers down for
now.

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So what's the first elimination
step that I do,

232
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the first matrix I multiply it
by, what letter will I use for

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that?
It'll be E two one,
because it's --

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the first step will be to get a
zero in that two one position.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,990
And then the next step will be
to get a zero in the three one

236
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,000
position.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,170
And the final step will be to
get a zero in the three two

238
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,000
position.

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's what elimination is,
and it produced U.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,040
And again, no row exchanges.

241
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,690
I'm taking the nice case,
now, the typical case,

242
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,000
too -- when I don't have to do
any row exchange,

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
all I do is these elimination
steps.

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Now, suppose I want that stuff
over on the right-hand side,

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,610
as I really do.

247
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,000
That's, like,
my point here.

248
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,700
I can multiply these together
to get a matrix E,

249
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,000
but I want it over on the
right.

250
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want its inverse over there.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So what's the right expression
now?

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,380
If I write A and U,
what goes there?

253
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay.

254
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So I've got the inverse of
this, I've got three matrices in

255
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
a row now.

256
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And it's their inverses that
are going to show up,

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because each one is easy to
invert.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Question is,
what about the whole bunch?

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
How easy is it to invert the
whole bunch?

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So, that's what we know how to
do.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We know how to invert,
we should take the separate

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
inverses, but they go in the
opposite order.

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,500
So what goes here?

264
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,000
E three two inverse,
right, because I'll multiply

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
from the left by E three two
inverse, then I'll pop it up

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,700
next to U.

267
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,099
And then will come E three one
inverse.

268
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:24,109
And then this'll be the only
guy left standing and that's

269
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,000
gone when Ido an E two one
inverse.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So there is L.

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's L U.

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
L is product of inverses.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Now you still can ask why is
this guy preferring inverses?

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And let me explain why.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let me explain why is this
product nicer than this one?

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,380
This product turns out to be
better than this one.

277
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,000
Let me take a typical case
here.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let me take a typical case.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So let me -- I have to do three
by three for you to see the

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,890
improvement.

281
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,000
Two by two, it was just one E,
no problem.

282
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But let me go up to this case.

283
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Suppose my matrices E21 --
suppose E21 has a minus two in

284
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
there.

285
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Suppose that -- and now suppose
-- oh, I'll even suppose E31 is

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the identity.

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm going to make the point
with just a couple of these.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Now this guy will have -- do
something -- now let's suppose

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
minus five one.

291
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay.
There's typical.

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,770
That's a typical case in which
we didn't need an E31.

293
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,000
Maybe we already had a zero in
that three one position.

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

295
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let me see -- is that going to
be enough to,

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
show my point?

297
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,180
Let me do that multiplication.

298
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,000
Okay.

299
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So if I do that multiplication
it's like good practice to

300
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
multiply these matrices.

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Tell me what's above the
diagonal when I do this

302
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,220
multiplication?

303
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,000
All zeroes.

304
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
When I do this multiplication,
I'm going to get ones on the

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
diagonal and zeroes above.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because -- what does that say?

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That says that I'm subtracting
rows from lower rows.

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So nothing is moving upwards as
it did last time in

309
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Gauss-Jordan.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Now -- so really,
what I have to do is check this

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
minus two one zero,
now this is -- what's that

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,490
number?

314
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,000
This is the number that I'm
really have in mind.

315
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That number is ten.

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And this one is -- what goes
here?

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Row three against column two,
it looks like the minus five.

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's that ten.

319
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How did that ten get in there?

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't like that ten.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I mean -- of course,
I don't want to erase it,

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
because it's right.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But I don't want it there.

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's because -- the ten got in
there because I subtracted two

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
of row one from row two,
and then I subtracted five of

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,560
that new row two from row three.

327
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,000
So doing it in that order,
how did row one effect row

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
three?

329
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, it did,
because two of it got removed

330
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
from row two and then five of
those got removed from row

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,770
three.

332
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,000
So altogether ten of row one
got thrown into row three.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Now my point is in the reverse
direction -- so now I can do it

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
-- below it I'll do the
inverses.

335
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

336
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And, of course,
opposite order.

337
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Reverse order.

338
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Reverse order.

339
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.
So now this is going to -- this
is the E that goes on the left

340
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
side.

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Left of A.

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Now I'm going to do the
inverses in the opposite order,

343
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
so what's the --
So the opposite order means I

344
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
put this inverse first.

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And what is its inverse?

346
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What's the inverse of E21?

347
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,170
Same thing with a plus sign,
right?

348
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,000
For the individual matrices,
instead of taking away two I

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
add back two of row one to row
two, so no problem.

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And now, in reverse order,
I want to invert that.

351
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Just right?

352
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm doing just this,
this.

353
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So now the inverse is again the
same thing, but add in the five.

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And now I'll do that
multiplication and I'll get a

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
happy result.

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I hope.

357
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Did I do it right so far?

358
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes, okay.

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let me do the multiplication.

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I believe this comes out.

361
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,530
So row one of the answer is one
zero zero.

362
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, I know that all this is
going to be left,

363
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,000
right?
Then I have two one zero.

364
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So I get two one zero there,
right?

365
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And what's the third row?

366
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What's the third row in this
product?

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Just read it out to me,
the third row?

368
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And this is my matrix L.

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And it's the one that goes on
the left of U.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It goes into -- what do I mean
here?

371
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Maybe rather than saying left
of A, left of U,

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
let me right down again what I
mean.

373
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
E A is U, whereas A is L U.

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay.

375
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Let me make the point now in
words.

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The order that the matrices
come for L is the right order.

377
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The two and the five don't sort
of interfere to produce this ten

378
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
in the right order,
the multipliers just sit in the

379
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
matrix L.

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's the point -- that if I
want to know L,

381
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I have no work to do.

382
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I just keep a record of what
those multipliers were,

383
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and that gives me L.

384
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I'll draw the -- let me say
it.

385
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So this is the A=L U.

386
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So if no row exchanges,
the multipliers that those

387
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
numbers that we multiplied rows
by and subtracted,

388
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,000
when we did an elimination step
-- the multipliers go directly

389
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
into L.

390
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,650
Okay.

391
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:22,000
So L is -- this is the way,
to look at elimination.

392
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You go through the elimination
steps, and actually if you do it

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
right, you can throw away A as
you create L U.

394
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
If you think about it,
those steps of elimination,

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,220
as when you've finished with
row two of A,

396
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:58,000
you've created a new row two of
U, which you have to save,

397
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and you've created the
multipliers that you used --

398
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
which you have to save,
and then you can forget A.

399
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So because it's all there in L
and U.

400
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So that's -- this moment is
maybe the new insight in

401
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
elimination that comes from
matrix --

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
doing it in matrix form.

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,420
So it was -- the product of Es
is -- we can't see what that

404
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,320
product of Es is.

405
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,000
The matrix E is not a
particularly attractive one.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,500
What's great is when we put
them on the other side --

407
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,000
their inverses in the opposite
order, there the L comes out

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,040
just right.

409
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay.

410
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,520
Now -- oh gosh,
so today's a sort of,

411
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,000
like, practical day.

412
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,170
Can we think together how
expensive is elimination?

413
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,000
How many operations do we do?

414
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So this is now a kind of new
topic which I didn't list as --

415
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
on the program,
but here it came.

416
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
How many operations on an n by
n matrix A.

417
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I mean, it's a very practical
question.

418
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Can we solve systems of order a
thousand, in a second or a

419
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
minute or a week?

420
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Can we solve systems of order a
million in a second or an hour

421
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
or a week?

422
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean, what's the -- if it's n
by n, we often want to take n

423
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
bigger.

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean, we've put in more
information.

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We make the whole thing is more
accurate for the bigger matrix.

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,820
But it's more expensive,
too, and the question is how

427
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,000
much more expensive?

428
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
If I have matrices of order a
hundred.

429
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Let's say a hundred by a
hundred.

430
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Let me take n to be a hundred.

431
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Say n equal a hundred.

432
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How many steps are we doing?

433
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
How many operations are we
actually doing that we --

434
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And let's suppose there aren't
any zeroes, because of course if

435
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,100
a matrix has got a lot of zeroes
in good places,

436
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,000
we don't have to do those
operations, and,

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
it'll be much faster.
It's going to move -- it's
going to change all rows,

438
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But -- so just think for a
moment about the first step.

439
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So here's our matrix A,
hundred by a hundred.

440
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And the first step will be --
that column, is got zeroes down

441
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,000
here.
So it's down to 99 by 99,
right?

442
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's really like the first
stage of elimination,

443
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
to get from this hundred by
hundred non-zero matrix to this

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
stage where the first pivot is
sitting up here and the first

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
row's okay the first column is
okay.

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So, eventually -- how many
steps did that take?

447
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You see, I'm trying to get an
idea.

448
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Is the answer proportional to
n?

449
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Is the total number of steps in
elimination, the total number,

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
is it proportional to n -- in
which case if I double n from a

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
hundred to two hundred -- does
it take me twice as long?

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Does it square,
so it would take me four times

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
as long?

454
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Does it cube so it would take
me eight times as long?

455
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Or is it n factorial,
so it would take me a hundred

456
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
times as long?

457
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I think, you know,
from a practical point of view,

458
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
we have to have some idea of
the cost, here.

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So these are the questions that
I'm -- let me ask those

460
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
questions again.

461
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Is it proportional -- does it
go like N, like N squared,

462
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
like N cubed -- or some higher
power of N?

463
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Like N factorial where every
step up multiplies by a hundred

464
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and then by a hundred and one
and then by a hundred and two --

465
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
which is it?

466
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay, so that's the only way I
know to answer that is to think

467
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
through what we actually had to
do.

468
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Okay.

469
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So what was the cost here?

470
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, let's see.

471
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What do I mean by an operation?

472
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I guess I mean,
well an addition or -- yeah.

473
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
No big deal.

474
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I guess I mean an addition or a
subtraction or a multiplication

475
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
or a division.

476
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

477
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And actually,
what operation I doing all the

478
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
time?

479
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
When I multiply row one by
multiplier L and I subtract from

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
row six.

481
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,000
What's happening there
individually?

482
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What's going on?

483
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
If I multiply -- I do a
multiplication by L and then a

484
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
subtraction.

485
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So I guess operation -- Can I
count that for the moment as,

486
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
like, one operation?

487
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Or you may want to count them
separately.

488
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The typical operation is
multiply plus a subtract.

489
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So if I count those together,
my answer's going to come out

490
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
half as many as if --
I mean, if I count them

491
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
separately, I'd have a certain
number of multiplies,

492
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
certain number of subtracts.

493
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,440
That's really want to do.

494
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay.

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
How many have I got here?

496
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So, I think -- let's see.

497
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,070
It's about -- well,
how many, roughly?

498
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,000
How many operations to get from
here to here?

499
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, maybe one way to look at
it is all these numbers had to

500
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
get changed.

501
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The first row didn't get
changed, but all the other rows

502
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
got changed at this step.

503
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So this step -- well,
I guess maybe -- shall I say it

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
cost about a hundred squared.

505
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, if I had changed the
first row, then it would have

506
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
been exactly hundred squared,
because --

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
because that's how many numbers
are here.

508
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
A hundred squared numbers is
the total count of the entry,

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and all but this insignificant
first row got changed.

510
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So I would say about a hundred
squared.

511
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay.

512
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Now, what about the next step?

513
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So now the first row is fine.

514
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The second row is fine.

515
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I'm changing these zeroes
are all fine,

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,830
so what's up with the second
step?

517
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,000
And then you're with me.

518
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Roughly, what's the cost?

519
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
If this first step cost a
hundred squared,

520
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
about, operations then this
one, which is really working on

521
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
this guy to produce this,
costs about what?

522
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
How many operations to fix?

523
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
About ninety-nine squared,
or ninety-nine times

524
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
ninety-eight.

525
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But less, right?

526
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Less, because our problem's
getting smaller.

527
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
About ninety-nine squared.

528
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And then I go down and down and
the next one will be

529
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
ninety-eight squared,
the next ninety-seven squared

530
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and finally I'm down around one
squared or --

531
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
where it's just like the little
numbers.

532
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The big numbers are here.

533
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,310
So the number of operations is
about n squared plus that was n,

534
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,000
right?
n was a hundred?

535
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
n squared for the first step,
then n minus one squared,

536
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
then n minus two squared,
finally down to three squared

537
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and two squared and even one
squared.

538
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No way I should have written
that -- squeezed that in.

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Let me try it so the count is N
squared plus N minus one squared

540
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,870
plus -- all the way down to one
squared.

541
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:34,000
That's a pretty decent count.

542
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,290
Admittedly, we didn't catch
every single tiny operation,

543
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:46,000
but we got the right leading
term here.

544
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,520
And what do those add up to?

545
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay, so now we're coming to
the punch of this,

546
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
question, this operation count.

547
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So the operations on the left
side, on the matrix A to finally

548
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
get to U.

549
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And anybody -- so which of
these quantities is the right

550
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
ballpark for that count?

551
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,980
If I add a hundred squared to
ninety nine squared to ninety

552
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,000
eight squared --
ninety seven squared,

553
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
all the way down to two squared
then one squared,

554
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
what have I got,
about?

555
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's just one of these -- let's
identify it first.

556
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Is it N?

557
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Certainly not.

558
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is it n factorial?

559
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,110
No.

560
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:49,000
If it was n factorial,
we would -- with determinants,

561
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
it is n factorial.

562
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'll put in a bad mark against
determinants,

563
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because that -- okay,
so what is it?

564
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,510
It's n -- well,
this is the answer.

565
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,000
It's this order -- n cubed.

566
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's like I have n terms,
right?

567
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I've got n terms in this sum.

568
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And the biggest one is N
squared.

569
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So the worst it could be would
be n cubed, but it's not as bad

570
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
as -- it's N cubed times --
it's about one third of n

571
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,110
cubed.

572
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,000
That's the magic operation
count.

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Somehow that one third takes
account of the fact that the

574
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
numbers are getting smaller.

575
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
If they weren't getting
smaller, we would have n terms

576
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
times n squared,
but it would be exactly n

577
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
cubed.

578
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But our numbers are getting
smaller -- actually,

579
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
do you remember where does one
third come in this -- I'll even

580
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
allow a mention of calculus.

581
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So calculus can be mentioned,
integration can be mentioned

582
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
now in the next minute and not
again for weeks.

583
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's not that I don't like
18.01, but18.06 is better.

584
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay.
So, -- so what's -- what's the
calculus formula that looks

585
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
like?

586
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,310
It looks like -- if we were in
calculus instead of summing

587
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,000
stuff, we would integrate.

588
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So I would integrate x squared
and I would get one third x

589
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
cubed.
So if that was like an integral
from one to N,

590
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
of x squared b x,
if the answer would be one

591
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
third n cubed --
and it's correct for the sum

592
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
also, because that's,
like, the whole point of

593
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
calculus.

594
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The whole point of calculus is
-- oh, I don't want to tell you

595
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
the whole -- I mean,
you know the whole point of

596
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
calculus.

597
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Calculus is like sums except
it's continuous.

598
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Okay.
And algebra is discreet.

599
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Okay.

600
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So the answer is one third n
cubed.

601
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Now I'll just -- let me say one
more thing about operations.

602
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
What about the right-hand side?

603
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
This was what it cost on the
left side.

604
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
This is on A.

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Because this is A that we're
working with.

606
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But what's the cost on the
extra column vector b that we're

607
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
hanging around here?

608
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So b costs a lot less,
obviously, because it's just

609
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
one column.

610
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We carry it through elimination
and then actually we do back

611
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
substitution.

612
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Let me just tell you the answer
there.

613
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's n squared.

614
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So the cost for every right
hand side is n squared.

615
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,690
So let me -- I'll just fit that
in here --

616
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:24,000
for the the cost of b turns out
to be n squared.

617
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So you see if we have,
as we often have,

618
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
a a matrix A and several
right-hand sides,

619
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,420
then we pay the price on A,
the higher price on A to get it

620
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,000
split up into L and U to do
elimination on A,

621
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,250
but then we can process every
right-hand side at low cost.

622
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay.

623
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So the -- We really have
discussed the most fundamental

624
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
algorithm for a system of
equations.

625
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Okay.

626
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So, I'm ready to allow row
exchanges.

627
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,470
I'm ready to allow -- now what
happens to this whole -- today's

628
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,000
lecture if there are row
exchanges?

629
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,530
When would there be row
exchanges?

630
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,000
There are row -- we need to do
row exchanges if a zero shows up

631
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in the pivot position.

632
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So moving then into the final
section of this chapter,

633
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
which is about transposes --
well, we've already seen some

634
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
transposes, and -- the title of
this section is,

635
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
"Transposes and Permutations."

636
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay.
So can I say,
now, where does a permutation

637
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
come in?

638
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let me talk a little about
permutations.

639
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So that'll be up here,
permutations.

640
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So these are the matrices that
I need to do row exchanges.

641
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I may have to do two row
exchanges.

642
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Can you invent a matrix where I
would have to do two row

643
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
exchanges and then would come
out fine?

644
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah let's just,
for the heck of it -- so I'll

645
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
put it here.

646
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Let me do three by threes.

647
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Actually, why don't I just
plain list all the three by

648
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
three permutation matrices.

649
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
There're a nice little group of
them.

650
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What are all the matrices that
exchange no rows at all?

651
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Well, I'll include the
identity.

652
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So that's a permutation matrix
that doesn't do anything.

653
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Now what's the permutation
matrix that exchanges -- what is

654
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
P12?

655
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The permutation matrix that
exchanges rows one and two would

656
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
be -- 0 1 0 -- 1 0 0,
right.

657
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I just exchanged those rows of
the identity and I've got it.

658
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Okay.
Actually, I'll -- yes.

659
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let me clutter this up.

660
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Okay.
Give me a complete list of all
the row exchange matrices.

661
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So what are they?

662
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
They're all the ways I can take
the identity matrix and

663
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
rearrange its rows.

664
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
How many will there be?

665
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
How many three by three
permutation matrices?

666
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Shall we keep going and get the
answer?

667
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So tell me some more.

668
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What one are you going to do
now?

669
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm going to switch rows one
and --

670
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
One and three,
okay.

671
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,310
One and three,
leaving two alone.

672
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:31,000
Okay.

673
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Now what else?

674
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Switch -- what would be the
next easy one -- is switch two

675
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,530
and three, good.

676
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:46,000
So I'll leave one zero zero
alone and I'll switch --

677
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'll move number three up and
number two down.

678
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Okay.
Those are the ones that just
exchange single -- a pair of

679
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,000
rows.
This guy, this guy and this guy
exchanges a pair of rows,

680
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,250
but now there are more
possibilities.

681
00:45:04,250 --> 00:41:52,000
What's left?

682
00:41:52,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So tell -- there is another one
here.

683
00:32:15,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What's that?

684
00:15:26,000 --> 00:13:50,000
right?

685
00:13:50,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where shall we put them?4

686
00:09:01,400 --> 00:12:19,000
STUDENT: Zero one zero?

687
00:12:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
STRANG: Zero one zero.

688
00:15:28,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay, now a second row -- say
zero zero one and the third guy

689
00:24:03,000 --> 00:26:03,000
one zero zero.

690
00:26:03,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So that is like a cycle.

691
00:29:30,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That puts row two moves up to
row one, row three moves up to

692
00:37:57,000 --> 00:45:41,000
row two and row one moves down
to row three.

693
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And there's one more,
which is -- let's see.

694
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
What's left?

695
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm lost.

696
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
STUDENT: Is it zero zero one?

697
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
STRANG: Okay.

698
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
STUDENT: One zero zero.

699
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
STRANG: One zero zero,
okay.

700
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,950
Zero one zero.

701
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay.

702
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Great.

703
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Six.
Six of them.

704
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Six P.
And they're sort of nice,
because what happens if I

705
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
write, multiply two of them
together?

706
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
If I multiply two of these
matrices together,

707
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
what can you tell me about the
answer?

708
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's on the list.

709
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
If I do some row exchanges and
then I do some more row

710
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,940
exchanges, then all together
I've done row exchanges.

711
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,570
So if I multiply -- but,
I don't know.

712
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,000
And if I invert,
then I'm just doing row

713
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
exchanges to get back again.

714
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,900
So the inverses are all there.

715
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,000
It's a little family of
matrices that -- they've got

716
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
their own -- if I multiply,
I'm still inside this group.

717
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
If I invert I'm inside this
group --

718
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
actually, group is the right
name for this subject.

719
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's a group of six matrices,
and what about the inverses?

720
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What's the inverse of this guy,
for example?

721
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
What's the inverse -- if I
exchange rows one and two,

722
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
what's the inverse matrix?

723
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Just tell me fast.

724
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The inverse of that matrix is
-- if I exchange rows one and

725
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
two, then what I should do to
get back to where I started is

726
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the same thing.

727
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So this thing is its own
inverse.

728
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's probably its own
inverse.

729
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
This is probably not --
actually, I think these are

730
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
inverses of each other.

731
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, yeah, actually -- the
inverse is the transpose.

732
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
There's a curious fact about
permutations matrices,

733
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that the inverses are the
transposes.

734
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And final moment -- how many
are there if I --

735
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
how many four by four
permutations?

736
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,680
So let me take four by four --
how many Ps?

737
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, okay.

738
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Make a good guess.

739
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Twenty four,
right.

740
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Twenty four Ps.

741
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Okay.
So, we've got these permutation
matrices, and in the next

742
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
lecture, we'll use them.
