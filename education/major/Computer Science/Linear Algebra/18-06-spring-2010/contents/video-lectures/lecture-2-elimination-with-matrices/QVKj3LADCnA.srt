1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay.
This is it.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:16,000
The second lecture in linear
algebra, and I've put below my

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
main topics for today.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I put right there a system of
equations that's going to be our

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
example to work with.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But what are we going to do
with it?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're going to solve it.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the method of solution will
not be determinants.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,280
Determinants are something that
will come later.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,000
The method we'll use is called
elimination.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And it's the way every software
package solves equations.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,750
And elimination,
well, if it succeeds,

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,930
it gets the answer.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,000
And normally it does succeed.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If the matrix A that's coming
into that system is a good

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
matrix, and I think this one is,
then elimination will work.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We'll get the answer in an
efficient way.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But why don't we,
as long as we're sort of seeing

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
how elimination works -- it's
always good to ask how could it

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
fail?
So at the same time,
we'll see how elimination

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
decides whether the matrix is a
good one or has problems.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then to complete the answer,
there's an obvious step of back

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
substitution.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In fact, the idea of
elimination is -- you would have

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
thought of it,
right?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I mean Gauss thought of it
before we did,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but only because he was born
earlier.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a natural idea...
and died earlier,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
too.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, and you've seen the idea.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But now, the part that I want
to show you is elimination

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
expressed in matrix language,
because the whole course --

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
all the key ideas get expressed
as matrix operations,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
not as words.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And one of the operations,
of course, that we'll meet is

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
how do we multiply matrices and
why?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, so there's a system of
equations.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Three equations and three
unknowns.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And there's the matrix,
the three by three matrix -- so

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
this is the system Ax = b.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is our system to solve,
Ax equal -- and the right-hand

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
side is that vector 2,
12, 2.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, when I describe
elimination -- it gets to be a

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
pain to keep writing the equal
signs and the pluses and so on.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's that matrix that totally
matters.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Everything is in that matrix.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But behind it is those
equations.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
So what does elimination do?

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,860
What's the first step of
elimination?

51
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,000
We accept the first equation,
it's okay.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to multiply that
equation by the right number,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the right multiplier and I'm
going to subtract it from the

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,850
second equation.

55
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,000
With what purpose?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So that will decide what the
multiplier should be.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Our purpose is to knock out the
x part of equation two.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,470
So our purpose is to eliminate
x.

59
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,000
So what do I multiply -- and
again, I'll do it with this

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
matrix, because I can do it
short.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's the multiplier here?

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do I multiply -- equation
one and subtract.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Notice I'm saying that word
subtract.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'd like to stick to that
convention.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll do a subtraction.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
First of all this is the key
number that I'm starting with.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,040
And that's called the pivot.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll put a box around it and
write its name down.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's the first pivot.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The first pivot.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.
So I'm going to use -- that's
sort of like the key number in

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that equation.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And now what's the multiplier?

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,280
So I'm going to -- my first row
won't change,

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,000
that's the pivot row.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I'm going to use it -- and
now, finally,

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
let me ask you what the
multiplier is.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes?

79
00:00:03,000 --> 00:04:50,000


80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
3 times that first equation
will knock out that 3.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So what will it leave?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So the multiplier is 3.
3 times that will make that 0.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,100
That was our purpose.
3 2s away from the 8 will leave

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,000
a 2 and three 1s away from 1
will leave a minus 2.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,230
And this guy didn't change.

87
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,150
Now the next step -- this is
forward elimination and that

89
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,000
step's completed.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, well, you could say wait a
minute, what about the right

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
hand side?
Shall I carry -- the right-hand
side gets carried along.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Actually MatLab finishes up
with the left side before -- and

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
then just goes back to do the
right side.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Maybe I'll be MatLab for a
moment and do that.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm leaving a room for a column
of b, the right-hand side.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I'll fill it in later.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,520
Okay.

99
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,000
Now the next step of
elimination is what?

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, strictly speaking...
this position that I cleaned up

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
was like the 2,
1 position, row 2,

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
column 1.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I got a 0 in the 2,
1 position.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll use 2,1 as the index of
that step.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The next step should be to
finish the column and get a 0 in

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that position.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,060
So the next step is really the
3,1 step, row three,

108
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,000
column one.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But of course,
I already have 0.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.
So the multiplier is 0.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I take 0 of this equation away
from this one and I'm all set.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I won't repeat that,
but there was a step there

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
which, MatLab would have to look
-- it would look at this number

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and, do that step,
unless you told it in advance

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that it was 0.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.
Now what?

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now we can see the second
pivot, which is what?

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The second pivot -- see,
we've eliminated -- x is now

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
gone from this equation,
right?

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're down to two equations in
y and z.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,970
And so now I just do it again.

122
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,000
Like, everything's very cursive
at this -- this is like --

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
such a basic algorithm and
you've seen it,

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but carry me through one last
step.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,110
So this is still the first
pivot.

126
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,000
Now the second pivot is this
guy, who has appeared there.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And what's the multiplier,
the appropriate multiplier now?

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And what's my purpose?

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is it to wipe out the 3,
2 position, right?

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This was the 2,
1 step.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And now I'm going to take the
3, 2 step.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,790
So this all stays the same,
1 2 1, 0 2 -1 and the pivots

133
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,000
are there.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now I'm using this pivot,
so what's the multiplier?

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:00:02,000


136
00:00:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
2 times this equation,

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
this row, gets subtracted from
this row and makes that a 0.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, I guess it's a 5,
is that right?

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because I have a one there and
I'm subtracting twice of twice

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
this, so I think it's a 5 there.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's the third pivot.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So let me put a box around all
three pivots.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Is there a -- oh,
did I just invent a negative

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,830
one?

146
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry that the tape can't,
correct that as easily as I

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
can.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay.
Thank you very much.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You get an A in the course now.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,270
Is that correct?

151
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,000
Is it correct now?

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.
So the three pivots are there
-- I know right away a lot about

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
this matrix.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This elimination step from A --
this matrix I'm going to call U.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
U for upper triangular.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So the whole purpose of
elimination was to get from A to

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
U.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And, literally,
that's the most common

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,370
calculation in scientific
computing.

160
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,000
And people think of how could I
do that faster?

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because it's a major,
major thing.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But we're doing it the
straightforward way.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,050
We found three pivots,
and by the way,

164
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn't say this,
pivots can't be 0.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't accept 0 as a pivot.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And I didn't get 0.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So this matrix is great.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It gave me three pivots,
I didn't have to do anything

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
special, I just followed the
rules and, and the pivots are 1,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
2 and 5.

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
By the way, just because I
always anticipate stuff from a

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
later day, if I wanted to know
the determinant of this matrix

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
--
which I never do want to know,

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,760
but I would just multiply the
pivots.

175
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
The determinant is 10.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So even things like the
determinant are here.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now -- oh, let me talk about
failure for a moment,

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and then --
and then come back to success.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How could this have failed?

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,450
How could -- by fail,
I mean to come up with three

182
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,000
pivots.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I mean, there are a couple of
points.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I would have already been in
trouble if this very first

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
number here was 0.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If it was a 0 there -- suppose
that had been a 0,

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,740
there were no Xs in that
equation -- first equation.

188
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,000
Does that mean I can't solve
the problem?

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Does that mean I quit?

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What do I do?
I switch rows.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I exchange rows.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So in case of a 0,
I will not say 0 pivot.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will never be heard to utter
those words, 0 pivot.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But if there's a 0 in the pivot
position, maybe I can say that,

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I would try to exchange for a
lower equation and get a proper

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
pivot up there.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Now, for example,
this second pivot came out two.

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,040
Could it have come out 0?

201
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,630
What -- actually,
if I change that 8 a little

202
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,000
bit, I would have got a little
trouble.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What should I change that 8 to
so that I run into trouble?

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A 6.
If that had been a 6,
then this would have been 0 and

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I couldn't have used that as the
pivot.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But I could have exchanged
again.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In this case.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In this case,
because when can I get out of

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
trouble?

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can get out of trouble if
there's a non-0 below this

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,360
troublesome 0.

212
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,000
And there is here.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So I would be okay in this
case.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If this was a 6,
I would survive by a row

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
exchange.
Now -- of course,
it might have happened that I

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,960
couldn't do the row,
that -- that there was 0s below

217
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
it, but here there wasn't.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, I could also have got in
trouble if this number 1 was a

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
little different.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
See, that 1 became a 5,
I guess, by the end.

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So can you see what number
there would have got me trouble

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
that I really couldn't get out
of?

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Trouble that I couldn't get out
of would mean if 0 is in the

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
pivot position and I've got no
place to exchange.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So there must be some number
which if I had had here it would

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
have meant failure.

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Negative 4, good.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If it was a negative 4 here --
if it happened to be a negative

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,890
4, I'll temporarily put it up
here.

230
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,000
If this had been a negative 4
z, then I would have gone

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
through the same steps.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This would have been a minus 4,
it still would have been a

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,000
minus 4.
But at the last minute it would
have become 0.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And there wouldn't have been a
third pivot.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The matrix would have not been
invertible.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, of course,
the inverse of a matrix is

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
coming next week,
but, you've heard these words

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
before.
So, that's how we identify
failure.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's temporary failure when
we can do a row exchange --

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,260
and get out of it,
or there's complete failure

241
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,000
when we get a 0 and -- and
there's nothing below that we

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
can use.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay.
Let's stay with -- back to
success now.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In fact, I guess the next topic
is back substitution.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So what's back substitution?

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,570
Well, now I'd better bring the
right-hand side in.

247
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,000
So what would MatLab do and
what should we do?

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let me bring in the right-hand
side as an extra column.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So there comes B.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So it's 2, 12,

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I would call this the augmented
matrix.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
"Augment" means you've tacked
something on.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I've tacked on this extra
column.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because, when I'm working with
equations, I do the same thing

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,760
to both sides.

256
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,000
So, at this step,
I subtracted 2 of the first

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
equation away from the second
equation so that this augmented

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
-- I even brought some colored
chalk, but I don't know if it

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000
shows up.
So this is like the augmented
-- no!

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Damn, circled the wrong thing.

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,750
Here is b.

263
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay, that's the extra column.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay.
So what happened to that extra
column, the right-hand side of

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the equations,
when I did the first step?

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So that was 3 of this away from
this, so it took -- the 2 stayed

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the same, but three 2s got taken
away from 12,

268
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
leaving 6, and that 2 stayed
the same.

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So this is how it's looking
halfway along.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And let me just carry to the
end.

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The 2 and the 6 stay the same,
but -- what do I have here?

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh, gosh.

273
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,000
Help me out,
now.

274
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What -- so now I'm --
This is still like forward

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
elimination.

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I got to this point,
which I think is right,

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,040
and now what did I do at this
step?

278
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,000
I multiplied that pivot by 2 or
that whole equation by 2 and

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
subtracted from that,
so I think I take two 6s,

280
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,070
which is 12,
away from the 2.

281
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you think minus 10 is my
final right-hand side -- the

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,630
right-hand side that goes with
U, and let me call that once and

283
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,000
forever the vector c.

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So c is what happens to b,
and U is what happens to A.

285
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay.

286
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There you've seen elimination
clean.

287
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, what's back substitution?

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So what are my final equations,
then?

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Can I copy these equations?
x+2y+z=2 is still there and

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
2y-2z=6 is there,
and 5z=-10.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Those are the equations that
these numbers are telling me

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
about.

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Those are the equations U x
equals c.

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay, how do I solve them?

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What one do I solve for first?
z.

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I see immediately that the
correct value of z is negative

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And what do I do next?

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I go back upwards.

301
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I now know z here.

302
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So, if z is negative 2,
that's 4 there,

303
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is that right?

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,630
And so 2 y plus a 4 is 6,
maybe y is 1.

305
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,000
Going -- this is back
substitution.

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,620
We're doing it on the fly
because it's so easy.

307
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,000
And then x is --
so x -- 2y is 2 minus 2,

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
maybe x is 2?

309
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So you see what back
substitution is.

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's the simple step solving
the equations in reverse order

311
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
because the system is
triangular.

312
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay.
Good.

313
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So that's elimination and back
substitution,

314
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and I kept the right-hand side
along.

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay, now what do I -- that,
like, is first piece of the

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
lecture.
What's the second piece?

317
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,800
Matrices are going to get in.

318
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,000
So I wrote stuff with x,
y-s and z-s in there,

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
then I really,
got the right shorthand,

320
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
just writing the matrix
entries, and now I want to write

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the operations that I did in
matrices, right?

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I've carried the matrices
along, but I haven't said the

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
operation those elimination
steps, I now want to express as

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,670
matrices.

325
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Here they come.

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So now this is elimination
matrices.

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Okay.

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Let me take that first step,
which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
0 4 1.

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I want to operate on that -- I
want to do elimination on that.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.
Okay, now I'm remembering a
point I want to single out as

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
especially important.

334
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let me move the board up for
that.

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because when we do matrix
operations, we've got to,

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
like, be able to see the big
picture.

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay.
Last time, I spoke about the
big picture of -- when I

338
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
multiply a matrix by a
right-hand side.

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If I have some matrix there and
I multiply it by 3 4 5,

340
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
let's say -- so here's a matrix
--

341
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what did I say -- well,
I guess I only said it on the

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
videotape, but -- do you
remember how I look at that

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
matrix multiplication?

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The result of multiplying a
matrix by some vector is a

345
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
combination of the columns of
the matrix.

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's 3 times the first column.

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's 3 times column one plus 4
times column two plus 5 times

348
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
column three.

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Okay.

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm going to come back to that
multiple times.

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What I wanted to do now was to
emphasize the parallel thing

352
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
with rows.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why?

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because all our operations here
for this two weeks of the course

355
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
are row operations.

356
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So this isn't what I need for
row operations.

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Let me do a row operation.

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Suppose I have my matrix again
and suppose I multiply on the

359
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
left by some -- let's say 1 2 7.

360
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Again, I'm just,
like, saying what the result

361
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,780
is.

362
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:35,000
And then we'll say how matrix
multiplication works and we'll

363
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
see that it's true.

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.
But maybe already I'm making --
I'm sort of bringing up -- the

365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
central idea of linear algebra
is how these matrices work by

366
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
rows as well as by columns.

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay.
How does it work by rows?

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What -- so that's a row vector.

369
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I could say that's a one by
three matrix,

370
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
a row vector multiplying a
three by three matrix.

371
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,570
What's the output?

372
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:20,000
What's the product of a row
times a matrix?

373
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And -- okay,
it's a row.

374
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
A row -- a column -- I'm sorry.

375
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
A matrix times a column is a
column.

376
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So matrix times a -- yeah.

377
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Matrix times a column is a
column.

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And we know what column it is.

379
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Over here, I'm doing a row
times a matrix.

380
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And what's the answer?

381
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's one of that first row,
so it's 1 times -- 1 times row

382
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
one, plus 2 times row two plus 7
times row three.

383
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
When -- as we do matrix
multiplication,

384
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
keep your eye on what it's
doing with whole vectors.

385
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And what it's doing -- what
it's doing in this case is it's

386
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,380
combining the rows.

387
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,000
And we have a combination,
a linear combination of the

388
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
rows.

389
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay, I want to use that.

390
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay, so my question is what's
the matrix that does this first

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
step, that takes -- subtracts 3
of equation one from equation

392
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
two?

393
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's what I want to do.

394
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So this is going to be a matrix
that's going to subtract 3 times

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
row one from row two,
and leaves the other rows the

396
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,000
same.
Just in -- I mean,
the answer is going to be that.

397
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So whatever matrix this is --
and you're going to,

398
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
like, tell me what matrix will
do it, it's the matrix that

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
leaves the first row unchanged,
leaves the last row unchanged,

400
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
but takes 3 of these away from
this so it puts a 0 there,

401
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
a 2 there and a minus 2.

402
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Good.

403
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,630
What matrix will do it?

404
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,000
It's these.

405
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,970
It should be a pretty simple
matrix, because we're doing a

406
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,000
very simple step.

407
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
We're just doing this step that
changes row two.

408
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So actually,
row one is not changing.

409
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So tell me how the matrix
should begin.

410
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
One -- the first row of the
matrix will be 1 0 0,

411
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because that's just the right
thing that takes one of that row

412
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and none of the other rows,
and that's what we want.

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What's the last row of the
matrix?

414
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
0 0 1, because that takes one
of the third row and none of the

415
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
other rows, that's great.

416
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay.

417
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Now, suppose I didn't want to
do anything at all.

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Suppose my row -- well,
I guess maybe I had a case here

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
when I already had a 0 and,
didn't have to do anything.

420
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,940
What matrix does nothing,
like, just leaves you where you

421
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,000
were?

422
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If I put in -- if I put in 0 1
0, that would be -- that would

423
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
be -- that's the matrix --
what's the name of that matrix?

424
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The identity matrix,
right.

425
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So it does absolutely nothing.

426
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It just multiplies everything
and leaves it where it is.

427
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's like a one,
like the number one,

428
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,100
for matrices.

429
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,000
But that's not what we want,
because we want to change this

430
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
row to -- so what's the correct
--

431
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
what should I put in here now
to do it right?

432
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I want to get -- what do I
want?

433
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What I -- I'm after -- I want 3
of row one to get subtracted

434
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,000
off.
So what's the right matrix,
finish that matrix for me.

435
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Negative 3 goes here?

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And what goes here?

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That 1.

438
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And what goes here?

439
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The 0.

440
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's the good matrix.

441
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That's the matrix that takes
minus 3 of row one plus the row

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
two and gives the new row 2.

443
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Should we just,
like, check some particular

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,000
entry?
How do I check a particular
entry of a matrix in matrix

445
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
multiplication?

446
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Like, suppose I wanted to check
the entry here that's in row

447
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
two, column three.

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So where does the entry in row
two, column three come from?

449
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I would look at row two of this
guy and column three of this one

450
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
to get that number.

451
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That number comes from the
second row and the third column

452
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and I just take this dot product
minus 3 -- I'm multiplying --

453
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
minus 3 plus 1 and 0 gives the
minus 2.

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah.

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It works.
So we got various ways to
multiply matrices now.

456
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We're sort of,
like -- informally.

457
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We've got by columns,
we've got -- well,

458
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we will have by columns,
by rows, by each entry at a

459
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
time.
But it's good to see that
matrix multiplication when one

460
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
of the matrices is so simple.

461
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So this guy is our elementary
matrix.

462
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Let's call it E for elementary
or elimination.

463
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,610
And let me put the indexes 2 1,
because it's the matrix that we

464
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,590
needed to fix the 2 1 position.

465
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:25,000
It's the matrix that we needed
to get this 2 1 position to be

466
00:29:25,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:29:25,000


468
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,000
Good enough.

469
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So what do I do next?

470
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I need another matrix,
right?

471
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I need to -- there's another
step here.

472
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I want to express the whole
elimination process in matrix

473
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
language.

474
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So tell me what -- so next
step, step two,

475
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
which was what?

476
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Subtract -- what was -- what
was the actual step that we did?

477
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think I subtracted -- do you
remember?

478
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I had a 2 in the pivot and a 4
below it, so I subtracted two

479
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,520
times -- times row two from row
three.

480
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,190
From row three.

481
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,000
Tell me the matrix that will do
that.

482
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,490
And tell me its name.

483
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay, it's going to be E,
for elementary or elimination

484
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
matrix and what's the index
number that I used to tell me

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
what E -- 3, 2,
right?

486
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Because it's fixing this 3 2
position.

487
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,690
And what's the matrix,
now?

488
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2
is supposed to multiply my guy

489
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that I have and it's supposed to
produce the right result,

490
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
which was -- it leaves -- it's
supposed to leave the first row,

491
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
it's supposed to leave the
second row and it's supposed to

492
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
straighten out that third row to
this.

493
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And what's the matrix that does
that?

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
1 0 0, right?

495
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because we don't change the
first row and the next row we

496
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
don't change either,
and the last row is the one we

497
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
do change.

498
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And what do I do?

499
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's see, I subtract two times
-- so what's this row?

500
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What's this here?
0, right, because the first

501
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
row's not involved.

502
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's just in the 3 2 position,
isn't it?

503
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This the key number is this
minus the multiplier that goes

504
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
-- sitting there in that 3 2
position.

505
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2
and then this is a 1 so that --

506
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the overall effect is to take
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of

507
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,000
that.
Okay.

508
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So, I've now given you the
pieces, the elimination

509
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
matrices, the elementary
matrices that take each step.

510
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So now what?

511
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,910
Now the next point in the
lecture is to put those steps

512
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,000
together into a matrix that does
it all and see how it all

513
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
happens.

514
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So now I'm going to express the
whole -- everything we did today

515
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
so far on A was to start with A,
we multiplied it by E 2 1,

516
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that was the first step --
and then we multiplied that

517
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
result by E 3 2 and that led us
to this thing and what was that

518
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
matrix?

519
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,800
U.

520
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,570
You see why I like matrix
notation, because there in,

521
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:16,000
like, little space -- a few
bits when its compressed on the

522
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
web -- is everything -- is this
whole lecture.

523
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Okay.
Now there -- there are
important facts about matrix

524
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
multiplication.

525
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And we're close to maybe the
most important.

526
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And that is this.

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Suppose I ask you this
question.

528
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Suppose I start with a matrix A
and I want to end with a matrix

529
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
U and I want to say what matrix
does the whole job?

530
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,120
What matrix takes me from A to
U, using the letters I've got?

531
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,000
And the answer is simple.

532
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not asking this as -- but
it's highly important.

533
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How would I create the matrix
that does the whole job at once,

534
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that does all of elimination in
one shot?

535
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It would be -- I would just put
these together,

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
right?

537
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In other words,
this is the thing I'm

538
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
struggling to say.

539
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I can move those parentheses.

540
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
If I keep the matrices in order
-- I can't mess around with the

541
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
order of the matrices,
but I can change the order that

542
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I do the multiplications.

543
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I can multiply these two first
-- in other words,

544
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,639
you see what those parentheses
are doing?

545
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,000
It's saying -- multiply the Es
first and that gives you the

546
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
matrix that does everything at
once.

547
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay.

548
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So this fact,
that this is automatically the

549
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
same as this -- for every matrix
multiplication,

550
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
which I'm conscious of still
not telling you in every detail,

551
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,420
but, like, you're seeing how it
works -- and this is highly

552
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,000
important --
and maybe tell me the long word

553
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that describes this law for
matrices, that you can move the

554
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
parentheses?

555
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's called the associative
law.

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I think you can now forget
that.

557
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But don't forget the law.

558
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean, like,
forget the word associative.

559
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't know.

560
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But don't forget the law.

561
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because actually,
we'll see so many steps in

562
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
linear algebra,
so many proofs,

563
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
even, of main fact come from
just moving the parentheses.

564
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And it's not that easy to prove
that this is correct,

565
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you have to go into the gory
details of matrix

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
multiplication,
do it both ways and see that

567
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
you come out the same.

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Maybe I'll leave the author to
do that.

569
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Okay.

570
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So there we go.

571
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So there's a single matrix,
I could call it E -- while

572
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
we're talking about these
matrices, tell me one other --

573
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
there's another type of
elementary matrix,

574
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and we already said why we
might need it.

575
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We didn't need it in this case.

576
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But it's the matrix that
exchanges two rows.

577
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's called a permutation
matrix.

578
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,550
Can you just,
like, tell me what that would

579
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,000
be?

580
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So I'm just -- like,
this is a slight digression and

581
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
we'll --
yes, so let me get some -- let

582
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
me figure out where I'm going to
put a permutation matrix.

583
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You'll see I'm always squeezing
stuff in.

584
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,440
So permutation.

585
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,000
Or, in fact this one you'll,
like, exchange rows -- shall I

586
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
exchange rows one and two,
just to make life easy?

587
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So if I had my matrix -- no,
let -- let me just do two by

588
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
two.
|a b; c d|.

589
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,040
Suppose I want to find the
matrix that exchanges those

590
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,610
rows.

591
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,000
What is it?

592
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So the matrix that exchanges
those rows -- the row I want is

593
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
c d and it's there.

594
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So I better take one of it.

595
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And the row I want here is up
top, so I'll take one of that.

596
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,430
So actually,
I'm just -- the easy way --

597
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,000
this is my matrix that I'll call
P, for permutation.

598
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's the matrix -- actually,
the easy way to find it is just

599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
do the thing to the identity
matrix.

600
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Exchange the rows of the
identity matrix and then that's

601
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
the matrix that will do row
exchanges for you.

602
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,990
Suppose I wanted to exchange
columns instead.

603
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,000
Columns have hardly got into
today's lecture,

604
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,610
but they certainly are going to
be around.

605
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:49,000
How could I -- if I started
with this matrix |a b;

606
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
c d| then I wouldn't -- I'm not
even going to write this down,

607
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm just going to ask you,
because in elimination,

608
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
we're doing rows.

609
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But suppose we wanted to
exchange the columns of a

610
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
matrix.

611
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
How would I do that?

612
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
What matrix multiplication
would do that job?

613
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,230
Actually, why not?

614
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll write it down.

615
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So this is -- I'll write it
under here and then hide it

616
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,710
again.

617
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,000
Okay.

618
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Suppose I had my matrix |a b;
c d| and I want to get to a c

619
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
over here and b d here.

620
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
What matrix does that job?

621
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Can I multiply -- can I cook up
some matrix that produces that

622
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
answer?

623
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You can see from where I put my
hand I was really asking can I

624
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,000
put a matrix here on the left
that will exchange columns?

625
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And the answer is no.

626
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm just bringing out again
this point that when I multiply

627
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
on the left, I'm doing row
operations.

628
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So if I want to do a column
operation, where do I put that

629
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
permutation matrix?

630
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
On the right.

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If I put it here,
where I just barely left room

632
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
for it -- so I'll exchange the
two columns of the identity.

633
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Then it comes out right,
because now I'm multiplying a

634
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
column at a time.

635
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This is the first column and
says take one --

636
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
take none of that column,
one of this one and then you

637
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,000
got it.
Over here, take one of this
one, none of this one and you've

638
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
got a c.

639
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So, in short,
to do column operations,

640
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the matrix multiplies on the
right.

641
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
To do row operations,
it multiplies on the left.

642
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay, okay, and it's row
operations that we're really

643
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
doing.
Okay.

644
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,990
And of course,
I mentioned in passing,

645
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,000
but I better say it very
clearly that you can't exchange

646
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the orders of matrices.

647
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And that's just the point I was
making again here.

648
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,750
A times B is not the same as B
times A.

649
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:46,000
You have to keep these matrices
in their Gauss given order here,

650
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
right?

651
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But you can move the
parentheses, so that,

652
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
in other words,
the commutative law,

653
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
which would allow you to take
it in the other order is false.

654
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So we have to keep it in that
order.

655
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay.
So what next?

656
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I could do this multiplication.

657
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I could do E 32.

658
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So let me come back to see what
that was.

659
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Here was E 2 1.

660
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And here is E 3 2.

661
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And if I multiply those two
matrices together -- E 3 2 and

662
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
then E 2 1, I'll get a single
matrix that does elimination.

663
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't want to do it that --
if I do that multiplication --

664
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
there -- there's a better way
to do this.

665
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And so in this last few minutes
of today's lecture,

666
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
can I anticipate that better
way?

667
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The better way is to think not
how do I get from A to U,

668
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
but how do I get from U back to
A?

669
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So reversing steps is going to
come in.

670
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Inverse -- I'll use the word
inverse here.

671
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,960
Okay.

672
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,000
So let me make the first step
at what's the inverse matrix?

673
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,550
All the matrices you've seen on
this board have inverses.

674
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,000
I didn't write any bad matrices
down.

675
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
We spoke about possible
failure, and for a moment,

676
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
we put in a matrix that would
fail.

677
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But right now,
all these matrices are good,

678
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
they're all invertible.

679
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And let's take the inverse --
well, let me say first what does

680
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
the inverse mean and find it?

681
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.
So we're getting a little leg
up on inverses.

682
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Okay, so this is the final
moments of today.

683
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Sorry, he's still there.

684
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay.

685
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Inverses.

686
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Okay, and I'm just going to
take one example and then we're

687
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
done.

688
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The example I'll take will be
that E.

689
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So my matrix is 1 0 0 minus 3 1
0 0 0 1.

690
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And I want to find the matrix
that undoes that step.

691
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So what was that step?

692
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
The step was subtract 3 times
row one from row two.

693
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So what matrix will get me
back?

694
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,730
What matrix will bring back --
you know, if I started with a 2

695
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:16,000
12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6 2
because of this guy,

696
00:45:16,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I want to get back to the 2 12

697
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I want to find the matrix which
-- which undoes elimination,

698
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the matrix which multiplies
this to give the identity.

699
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And you can tell me what I
should do in words first,

700
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and then we'll write down the
matrix that does it.

701
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
If this step subtracted 3 times
row 1 from row 2,

702
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
what's the inverse step?

703
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I add 3 times row one to row
two, right?

704
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I add it back.

705
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The -- what I subtracted away,
I add back.

706
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,940
So the inverse matrix in this
case is --

707
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,000
I now want to add 3 times row
one to row two,

708
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,170
so I won't change row one,
I won't change row three and

709
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,000
I'll add 3 times row one to row
two.

710
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That's a case where the inverse
is clear.

711
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's clear in words what to do,
because what this did was

712
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
simple to express.

713
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It just changed row two by
subtracting 3 of row one.

714
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So to invert it,
I go that way.

715
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And if you -- if we do that
calculation, 3 times this row

716
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
plus 1 times this row,
comes out the right row of the

717
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
identity.

718
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay, so inverses are an -- so
if this matrix was E and this

719
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,980
matrix is I for identity,
then what's the notation for

720
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,000
this guy?

721
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
E to the minus one.

722
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
E inverse.

723
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay.
Let's stop there for today.

724
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That's a little jump on what's
coming on Monday.

725
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So, see you Monday.
