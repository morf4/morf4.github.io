1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OK, here's the last lecture in
the chapter on orthogonality.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we met orthogonal vectors,
two vectors,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
we met orthogonal subspaces,
like the row space and null

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
space.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now today we meet an orthogonal
basis, and an orthogonal matrix.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So we really --
this chapter cleans up

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
orthogonality.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And really I want -- I should
use the word orthonormal.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Orthogonal is -- so my vectors
are q1,q2 up to qn -- I use the

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
letter "q", here,
to remind me,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm talking about orthogonal
things, not just any vectors,

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but orthogonal ones.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So what does that mean?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That means that every q is
orthogonal to every other q.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a natural idea,
to have a basis that's headed

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
off at ninety-degree angles,
the inner products are all

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
zero.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Of course if q is -- certainly
qi is not orthogonal to itself.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But there we'll make the best
choice again,

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
make it a unit vector.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then qi transpose qi is one,
for a unit vector.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The length squared is one.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And that's what I would use the
word normal.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So for this part,
normalized,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
unit length for this part.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
OK.
So first part of the lecture is
how does having an orthonormal

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
basis make things nice?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It certainly does.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It makes all the calculations
better, a whole lot of numerical

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
linear algebra is built around
working with orthonormal

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
vectors,
because they never get out of

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
hand, they never overflow or
underflow.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I'll put them into a matrix
Q, and then the second part of

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the lecture will be suppose my
basis, my columns of A are not

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
orthonormal.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How do I make them so?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,410
And the two names associated
with that simple idea are Graham

38
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,360
and Schmidt.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,000
So the first part is we've got
a basis like this.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's put those into the
columns of a matrix.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So a matrix Q that has -- I'll
put these orthonormal vectors,

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
q1 will be the first column,
qn will be the n-th column.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I want to say,
I want to write this property,

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
qi transpose qj being zero,
I want to put that in a matrix

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
form.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And just the right thing is to
look at Q transpose Q.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So this chapter has been
looking at A transpose A.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it's natural to look at Q
transpose Q.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And the beauty is it comes out
perfectly.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because Q transpose has these
vectors in its rows,

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the first row is q1 transpose,
the nth row is qn transpose.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that's Q transpose.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And now I want to multiply by
Q.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That has q1 along to qn in the
columns.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's Q.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And what do I get?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You really -- this is the first
simplest most basic fact,

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that how do orthonormal
vectors, orthonormal columns in

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a matrix, what happens if I
compute Q transpose Q?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you see it?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If I take the first row times
the first column,

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
what do I get?

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,409
A one.

64
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,000
If I take the first row times
the second column,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
what do I get?

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zero.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's the orthogonality.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The first row times the last
column is zero.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And so I'm getting ones on the
diagonal and I'm getting zeroes

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
everywhere else.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm getting the identity
matrix.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,540
You see how that's --
it's just like the right

73
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,000
calculation to do.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you have orthonormal
columns, and the matrix doesn't

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,080
have to be square here.

76
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,000
We might have just two columns.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And they might have four,
lots of components.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So but they're orthonormal,
and when we do Q transpose

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
times Q,
that Q transpose times Q or A

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
transpose A just asks for all
those dot products.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Rows times columns.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And in this orthonormal case,
we get the best possible

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
answer, the identity.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
OK, so this is -- so I mean now
we have a new bunch of important

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
matrices.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What have we seen previously?

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We've seen in the distant past
we had triangular matrices,

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
diagonal matrices,
permutation matrices,

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that was early chapters,
then we had row echelon forms,

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then in this chapter we've
already seen projection

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
matrices,
and now we're seeing this new

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,990
class of matrices with
orthonormal columns.

93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,000
That's a very long expression.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I sorry that I can't just call
them orthogonal matrices.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But that word orthogonal
matrices -- or maybe I should be

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,060
able to call it orthonormal
matrices, why don't we call it

97
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,000
orthonormal --
I mean that would be an

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
absolutely perfect name.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For Q, call it an orthonormal
matrix because its columns are

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
orthonormal.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,060
OK, but the convention is that
we only use that name orthogonal

102
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,000
matrix, we only use this -- this
word orthogonal,

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we don't even say orthonormal
for some unknown reason,

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
matrix when it's square.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So in the case when this is a
square matrix,

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that's the case we call it an
orthogonal matrix.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And what's special about the
case when it's square?

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
When it's a square matrix,
we've got its inverse,

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
so --
so in the case if Q is square,

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
then Q transpose Q equals I
tells us -- let me write that

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
underneath -- tells us that Q
transpose is Q inverse.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,450
There we have the easy to
remember property for a square

113
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,000
matrix with orthonormal columns.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That -- I need to write some
examples down.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's see.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Some examples like if I take
any -- so examples,

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
let's do some examples.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Any permutation matrix,
let me take just some random

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
permutation matrix.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Permutation Q equals let's say
oh, make it three by three,

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
say zero, zero,
one, one, zero,

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
zero, zero, one,
zero.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OK.
That certainly has unit vectors
in its columns.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,670
Those vectors are certainly
perpendicular to each other.

125
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,000
And if I -- and so that's it.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That makes it a Q.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And -- if I took its transpose,
if I multiplied by Q transpose,

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
shall I do that --
and let me stick in Q transpose

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
here.
Just to do that multiplication
once more, transpose it'll put

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the -- make that into a column,
make that into a column,

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
make that into a column.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And the transpose is also --
another Q.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Another orthonormal matrix.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And when I multiply that
product I get I.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
OK, so there's an example.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And actually there's a second
example.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But those are real easy
examples, right,

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,390
I mean to get orthogonal
columns by just putting ones in

139
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,000
different places is like too
easy.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So let me keep going with
examples.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So here's another simple
example.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Cos theta sine theta,
there's a unit vector,

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
oh, let me even take it,
well, yeah.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Cos theta sine theta and now
the other way I want sine theta

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
cos theta.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I want the inner product to
be zero.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And if I put a minus there,
it'll do it.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So that's --
unit vector,

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that's a unit vector.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And if I take the dot product,
I get minus plus zero.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OK.
For example Q equals say one,
one, one, minus one,

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is that an orthogonal matrix?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I've got orthogonal columns
there, but it's not quite an

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,010
orthogonal matrix.

155
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,000
How shall I fix it to be an
orthogonal matrix?

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, what's the length of
those column vectors,

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the dot product with themselves
is -- right now it's two,

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
right, the -- the length
squared.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The length squared would be one
plus one would be two,

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the length would be square root
of two,

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so I better divide by square
root of two.

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OK.
So there's a -- there now I
have got an orthogonal matrix,

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in fact, it's this one -- when
theta is pi over four.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The cosines and well almost,
I guess the minus sine is down

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
there, so maybe,
I don't know,

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,760
maybe minus pi over four or
something.

167
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,000
OK.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let me do one final example,
just to show that you can get

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
bigger ones.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Q equals let me take that
matrix up in the corner and I'll

171
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
sort of repeat that pattern,
repeat it again,

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and then minus it down here.

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's one of the world's
favorite orthogonal matrices.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I hope I got it right,
is -- can you see whether -- if

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I take the inner product of one
column with another one,

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
let's see, if I take the inner
product of that column with that

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have two minuses and two
pluses, that's good.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When I take the inner product
of that with that I have a plus

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and a minus, a minus and a plus.

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Good.
I think it all works out.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,030
And what do I have to divide by
now?

182
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,000
To make those into unit
vectors.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Right now the vector one,
one, one, one has length two.

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Square root of four.

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I have to divide by two to
make it unit vector,

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so there's another.

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's my entire array of
simple examples.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This construction is named
after a guy called Adhemar and

189
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we know how to do it for two,
four, sixteen,

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
sixty-four and so on,
but we -- nobody knows exactly

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
which size matrices have --
which size -- which sizes allow

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
orthogonal matrices of ones and
minus ones.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So Adhemar matrix is an
orthogonal matrix that's got

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
ones and minus ones,
and a lot of ones -- some we

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
know, some other sizes,
there couldn't be a five by

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
five I think.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But there are some sizes
that nobody yet knows whether

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
there could be or can't be a
matrix like that.

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,130
OK.

200
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,000
You see those orthogonal
matrices.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Now let me ask what -- why is
it good to have orthogonal

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
matrices?

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What calculation is made easy?

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If I have an orthogonal matrix.

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And -- let me remember that
the matrix could be

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
rectangular.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Shall I put down -- I better
put a rectangular example down.

208
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So the -- these were all square
examples.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,620
Can I put down just -- a
rectangular one just to be sure

210
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,000
that we realize that this is
possible.

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
let's help me out.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,550
Let's see,
if I put like a one,

213
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,000
two, two and a minus two,
minus one, two.

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's -- a matrix -- oh its
columns aren't normalized yet.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I always have to remember to do
that.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I always do that last because
it's easy to do.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What's the length of those
columns?

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So if I wanted them --
if I wanted them to be length

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
one, I should divide by their
length, which is -- so I'd look

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
at one squared plus two squared
plus two squared,

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that's one and four and four is
nine, so I take the square root

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and I need to divide by three.

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,000
OK.
So there is -- well,
without that,

224
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,000
I've got one orthonormal
vector.

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I mean just one unit vector.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now put that guy in.

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Now I have a basis for the
column space for a

228
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
two-dimensional space,
an orthonormal basis,

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
right?

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,270
These two columns are
orthonormal, they would be an

231
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:58,000
orthonormal basis for this
two-dimensional space that they

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
span.

233
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Orthonormal vectors by the way
have got to be independent.

234
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's easy to show that
orthonormal vectors since

235
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
they're headed off all at ninety
degrees there's no combination

236
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that gives zero.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Now if I wanted to create now a
third one, I could either just

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
put in some third vector that
was independent

239
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and go to this Graham-Schmidt
calculation that I'm going to

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,900
explain, or I could be inspired
and say look,

241
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,000
that -- with that pattern,
why not put a one in there,

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and a two in there,
and a two in there,

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and try to fix up the signs so
that they worked.

244
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hmm.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know if I've done this
too brilliantly.

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's see, what signs,
that's minus,

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
maybe I'd make a minus sign
there, how would that be?

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, maybe that works.

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think that those three
columns are orthonormal and they

250
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
-- the beauty of this -- this is
the last example I'll probably

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
find where there's no square
root, the -- the punishing thing

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in Graham-Schmidt,
maybe we better know that in

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
advance, is that because I want
these vectors to be unit

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
vectors, I'm always running into
square roots.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm always dividing by lengths.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And those lengths are square
roots.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So you'll see as soon as I do a
Graham-Schmidt example,

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
square roots are going to show
up.

259
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But here are some examples
where we did it without any

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
square root.

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,000
OK.
OK.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So -- so great.

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Now next question is what's the
good of having a Q?

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What formulas become easier?

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,590
Suppose I want to project,
so suppose Q -- suppose Q has

266
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,000
orthonormal columns.

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm using the letter Q to mean
this, I'll write it this one

268
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
more time, but I always mean
when I write a Q,

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I always mean that it has
orthonormal columns.

270
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So suppose I want to project
onto its column space.

271
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So what's the projection
matrix?

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What's the projection matrix is
I project onto a column space?

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
OK, that gives me a chance to
review the projection section,

274
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
including that big formula,
which used to be -- those four

275
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
As in a row, but now it's got
Qs, because I'm projecting onto

276
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the column space of Q,
so do you remember what it was?

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's Q Q transpose Q inverse Q
transpose.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's my four Qs in a row.

279
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But what's good here?

280
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What --
what makes this formula nice if

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm projecting onto a column
space when I have orthonormal

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
basis for that space?

283
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What makes it nice is this is
the identity.

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't have to do any
inversion.

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I just get Q Q transpose.

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So Q Q transpose is a
projection matrix.

287
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, I can't help --
I can't resist just checking

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
the properties,
what are the properties of a

289
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
projection matrix?

290
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are two properties to
know for any projection matrix.

291
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I'm saying that this is the
right projection matrix when

292
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
we've got this orthonormal basis
in the columns.

293
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,000
OK.
So there's the projection
matrix.

294
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Suppose the matrix is square.

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
First just tell me first this
extreme case.

296
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If my matrix is square and it's
got these orthonormal columns,

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
then what's the column space?

298
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If I have a square matrix and I
have independent columns,

299
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and even orthonormal columns,
then the column space is the

300
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
whole space, right?

301
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And what's the projection
matrix onto the whole space?

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The identity matrix.

303
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If I'm projecting in the whole
space, every vector B is right

304
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
where it's supposed to be and I
don't have to move it by

305
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
projection.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So this would be -- I'll put in
parentheses this is I if Q is

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
square.

308
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well that we said that already.

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If Q is square,
that's the case where Q

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
transpose is Q inverse,
we can put it on the right,

311
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
we can put it on the left,
we always get the identity

312
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
matrix, if it's square.

313
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But if it's not a square matrix
then it's not -- we don't get

314
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the identity matrix.

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We have Q Q transpose,
and just again what are those

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,410
two properties of a projection
matrix?

317
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,630
First of all,
it's symmetric.

318
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,040
OK, no problem,
that's certainly a symmetric

319
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,000
matrix.

320
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So what's that second property
of a projection?

321
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That if you project and project
again you don't move the second

322
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,000
time.
So the other property of a
projection matrix should be that

323
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Q Q transpose twice should be
the same

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
as Q Q transpose once.

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's projection matrices.

326
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And that property better fall
out right away because from the

327
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
fact we know about orthonormal
matrices, Q transpose Q is I.

328
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
OK, you see it.

329
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,520
In the middle here is sitting Q
Q t- Q transpose Q,

330
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,000
sorry, that's what I meant to
say,

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Q transpose Q is I.

332
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So that's sitting right in the
middle, that cancels out,

333
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,130
to give the identity,
we're left with one Q Q

334
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,000
transpose, and we're all set.

335
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OK.

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So this is the projection
matrix -- all the equation --

337
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
all the messy equations of this
chapter become trivial when our

338
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
matrix -- when we have this
orthonormal basis.

339
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I mean what do I mean by all
the equations?

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, the most important
equation was the normal

341
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
equation, do you remember old A
transpose A x hat equals A

342
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
transpose b?

343
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But now -- now A is Q.

344
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Now I'm thinking I
have Q transpose Q X hat equals

345
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Q transpose b.

346
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And what's good about that?

347
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What's good is that matrix on
the left side is the identity.

348
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The matrix on the left is the
identity, Q transpose Q,

349
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
normally it isn't,
normally it's that matrix of

350
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
inner products and you've to
compute all those dopey inner

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
products and -- and -- and solve
the system.

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Here the inner products are all
one or zero.

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is the identity matrix.

354
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's gone.

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And there's the answer.

356
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There's no inversion involved.

357
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Each component of x is a Q
times b.

358
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What that equation
is saying is that the i-th

359
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
component is the i-th basis
vector times b.

360
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's -- probably the most
important formula in some major

361
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
parts of mathematics,
that if we have orthonormal

362
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
basis, then the component
in the -- in the i-th,

363
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
along the i-th -- the
projection on the i-th basis

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
vector is just qi transpose b.

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That number x that we look for
is just a dot product.

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
OK.

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
OK, so I'm ready now for the
sort of like second half of the

368
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
lecture.

369
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Where we don't start with an
orthogonal matrix,

370
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
orthonormal vectors.

371
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We just start with independent
vectors and we want to make them

372
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
orthonormal.

373
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I'm going to -- can I do
that now?

374
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Now here comes Graham-Schmidt.

375
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So -- Graham-Schmidt.

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,110
So this
is a calculation,

377
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:00,000
I won't say -- I can't quite
say it's like elimination,

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
because it's different,
our goal isn't triangular

379
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
anymore.

380
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
With elimination our goal was
make the matrix triangular.

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Now our goal is make the matrix
orthogonal.

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
Make those columns orthonormal.

383
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,920
So let me start with two
columns.

384
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,000
So I start with vectors a and
b.

385
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And they're just like -- here,
let me draw them.

386
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Here's a.

387
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Here's b.

388
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
For example.

389
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A isn't specially horizontal,
wasn't meant to be,

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
just a is one
vector, b is another.

391
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,700
I want to produce those two
vectors, they might be in

392
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,000
twelve-dimensional space,
or they might be in

393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
two-dimensional space.

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They're independent,
anyway.

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So I better be sure I say that.

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I start with independent
vectors.

397
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And I want to produce out of
that q

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,400
1 and q2, I want to produce
orthonormal vectors.

399
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,000
And Graham and Schmidt tell me
how.

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
OK.
Well, actually you could tell
me how, we don't need --

401
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
frankly, I don't know -- there's
only one idea here,

402
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
if Graham had the idea,
I don't know what Schmidt did.

403
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But OK.

404
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So you'll see it.

405
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We don't need either of them,
actually.

406
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
OK, so what I going to do.

407
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll take that -- this first
guy.

408
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
OK.

409
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,650
Well, he's fine.

410
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:02,000
That direction is fine except
-- yeah, I'll say OK,

411
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll settle for that direction.

412
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So I'm going to --
I'm going to get,

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
so what I going to -- my goal
is I'm going to get orthogonal

414
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
vectors and I'll call those
capital A and B.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So that's the key step is to
get from any two vectors to two

416
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
orthogonal vectors.

417
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And then at the end,
no problem, I'll get

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
orthonormal vectors,
how will --

419
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
what will those will be my qs,
q1 and q2, and what will they

420
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
be?
Once I've got A and B
orthogonal, well,

421
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
look, it's no big deal -- maybe
that's what Schmidt did,

422
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he, brilliant Schmidt,
thought OK, divide by the

423
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
length, all right.

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's Schmidt's contribution.

425
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
OK.
But Graham had a little more
thinking to do,

426
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
right?

427
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We haven't done Graham's part.

428
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
This part except OK,
I'm happy with A,

429
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,650
A can be A.

430
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,000
That first direction is fine.

431
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Why should -- no complaint
about that.

432
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The trouble is the second
direction is not fine.

433
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because it's not orthogonal to
the first.

434
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm looking for a vector
that's -- starts with B,

435
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
but makes it orthogonal to A.

436
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,320
What's the vector?

437
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,000
How do I do that?

438
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
How do I produce from this
vector a piece that's orthogonal

439
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to this one?

440
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And the -- remember these
vectors might be in two

441
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
dimensions or they might be in
twelve

442
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
dimensions.

443
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm just looking for the idea.

444
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So what's the idea?

445
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Where did we have orthogonal --
a vector showing up that was

446
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
orthogonal to this guy?

447
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, that was the first basic
calculation of the whole

448
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
chapter.

449
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We -- we did a projection and
the projection gave us this

450
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
part,
which was the part in the A

451
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
direction.

452
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Now, the part we want is the
other part, the e part.

453
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
This part.

454
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This is going to be our -- that
guy is that guy.

455
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is our vector B.

456
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That gives us that
ninety-degree angle.

457
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So B is you could say -- B is
really what we previously called

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
e.
The error vector.

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And what is it?

460
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I mean what do I -- what is B
here?

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A is A, no problem.

462
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
B is -- OK, what's this error
piece?

463
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,720
Do you remember?

464
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,000
It's I start with the original
B and I take away what?

465
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Its projection,
this P.

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This -- the vector B,
this error vector,

467
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
is the original vector removing
the projection.

468
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So instead of wanting the
projection,

469
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
now that's what I want to throw
away.

470
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I want to get the part that's
perpendicular.

471
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And there will be a
perpendicular part,

472
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,820
it won't be zero.

473
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,000
Because these vectors were
independent, so B -- if B was

474
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
along the direction of A,
then if the original B and A

475
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
were in the same direction,
then I'm -- I've only got one

476
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,080
direction.

477
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,000
But here they're in two
independent directions and all

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm doing is getting that guy.

479
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So what's its formula?

480
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What's the formula for that if
-- I want to subtract

481
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
the projection,
so do you remember the

482
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
projection?

483
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's some multiple of A and
what's that multiple?

484
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's -- it's that thing we
called x in the very very first

485
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
lecture on this chapter.

486
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There's an A transpose A in the
bottom and there's an A

487
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
transpose B, isn't that it?

488
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I think that's Graham's
formula.

489
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Or Graham-Schmidt.

490
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
No, that's Graham.

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Schmidt has got to divide the
whole thing by the length,

492
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
so he -- his formula makes a
mess which I'm not willing to

493
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
write down.

494
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So let's just see that what I
saying here?

495
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm saying that this vector is
perpendicular to A.

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That these are orthogonal.

497
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
A is perpendicular to B.

498
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Can you check that?

499
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
How do you see that yes,
of course, we -- our picture is

500
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
telling us, yes,
we did it right.

501
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
How would I check that this
matrix is perpendicular to A?

502
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I would multiply by A transpose
and I better get zero,

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
right?

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I should check that.

505
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
A transpose B should come out
zero.

506
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,710
So this is A transpose times --
now what did we say B was?

507
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,000
We start with the original B,
and we take away this

508
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
projection, and that should come
out zero.

509
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, here we get an A
transpose B minus -- and here is

510
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
another A transpose B,
and the -- and it's an A

511
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
transpose A over A transpose A,
a one, those cancel,

512
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and we do get zero.

513
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Right.

514
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Now I guess I can do numbers in
there.

515
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But I have to take a third
vector to be sure we've got this

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,440
system down.

517
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:34,000
So now I have to say if I have
independent vectors A,

518
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
B and C, I'm looking for
orthogonal vectors A,

519
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
B and capital C,
and then of course the third

520
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
guy will just be C over its
length, the unit vector.

521
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So this is now the problem.

522
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I got B here.

523
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I got A very easily.

524
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And now -- if you see the idea,
we could figure out a formula

525
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
for C.

526
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So now that -- so this is like
a typical homework quiz problem.

527
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,810
I give you two vectors,
you do this,

528
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,000
I give you three vectors,
and you have to make them

529
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
orthonormal.

530
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So you do this again,
the first vector's fine,

531
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
the second vector is
perpendicular

532
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
to the first,
and now I need a third vector

533
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
that's perpendicular to the
first one and the second one.

534
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Right?

535
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Tthis is the end of a -- the
lecture is to find this guy.

536
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Find this vector -- this vector
C, that's perpendicular we n- at

537
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
this point we know A and B.

538
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But C, the little c that we're
given, is off in some -- it's

539
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,820
got to come out of the
blackboard to be independent,

540
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,000
so -- so can I sort of draw off
-- off comes a c somewhere.

541
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know,
where I going to put the darn

542
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,000
thing?
Maybe I'll put it off,
oh, I don't know,

543
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
like that somehow,
C, little c.

544
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I already know that
perpendicular direction,

545
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,170
that one and that one.

546
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,000
So now what's the idea?

547
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Give me the Graham-Schmidt
formula for C.

548
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What is this C here?

549
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Equals what?

550
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What I going to do?

551
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'll start with the given one.

552
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
As before.

553
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Right?
I start with the vector I'm
given.

554
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And what do I do with it?

555
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I want to remove out of it,
I want to subtract off,

556
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
so I'll put a minus sign in,
I want to subtract off its

557
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
components in the A,
capital A and capital B

558
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
directions.

559
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I just want to get those out of
there.

560
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, I know how to do that.

561
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I did it with B.

562
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So I'll just -- so let me take
away -- what if I do this?

563
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What have I done?

564
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I've got little c and what have
I subtracted from it?

565
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Its component,
its projection if

566
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
you like, in the A direction.

567
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And now I've got to subtract
off its component B transpose C

568
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
over B transpose B,
that multiple of B,

569
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
is its component in the B
direction.

570
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And that gives me the vector
capital C that if anything is --

571
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,560
if there's any justice,
this C should be perpendicular

572
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,000
to A and it should be
perpendicular to B.

573
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And the only thing it's --
hasn't got is unit vector,

574
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,680
so we divide by its length to
get that too.

575
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,000
OK.

576
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let me do an example.

577
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Can I -- I'll make my life
easy, I'll just take two

578
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
vectors.

579
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So let me do a numerical
example.

580
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If I'll give you two vectors,
you give me back the

581
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Graham-Schmidt orthonormal
basis, and we'll see how to

582
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
express that in matrix form.

583
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
OK.
So let me give you the two
vectors.

584
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So I'll take the vector A
equals let's say

585
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
one, one, one,
why not?

586
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And B equals let's say one,
zero, two, OK?

587
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I didn't want to cheat and make
them orthogonal in the first

588
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
place because then
Graham-Schmidt wouldn't be

589
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
needed.

590
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
OK.

591
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So those are not orthogonal.

592
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So what is capital A?

593
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well that's the same as big A.

594
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That was fine.

595
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
What's B?

596
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So B is this b -- is the
original B, and then I subtract

597
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
off some multiple of the A.

598
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,990
And what's the multiple?

599
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,000
What goes in here?

600
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
B -- here's the A -- this is
the -- this is the little b,

601
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
this is the big A,
also the little a,

602
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and I want to multiply it by
that right -- that right ratio,

603
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
which has A transpose A,
here's my ratio.

604
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm just doing this.

605
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So it's A transpose B,
what is A transpose B,

606
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,970
it looks like three.

607
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:23,000
And what is A -- oh,
my -- what's A transpose A?

608
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,800
Three.

609
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sorry.

610
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I didn't know that was going to
happen.

611
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
OK.
But it happened.

612
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Why should we knock it?

613
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
OK.
So do you see it all right?

614
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's A transpose B,
there's A transpose A,

615
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that's the fraction,
so I take this away,

616
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and I get one take away one is
a zero, zero minus this one is a

617
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
minus one, and two minus the one
is a one.

618
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
OK.

619
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And what's this vector that we
finally found?

620
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
This is B.

621
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And how do I know it's right?

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,030
How do I know I've got a vector
I want?

623
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,000
I check that B is perpendicular
to -- that A and B are

624
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
perpendicular.

625
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That A is perpendicular to B.

626
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Just look at that.

627
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That one -- the dot product of
that with that is zero.

628
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,000
OK.
So now what is my q1 and q2?

629
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Why don't I put them in a
matrix?

630
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Of course.

631
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Since I'm always putting these
-- so the Q, I'll put the q1 and

632
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,140
the
q2 in a matrix.

633
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,000
And what are they?

634
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Now when I'm writing q-s I'm
supposed to make things

635
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
normalized.

636
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm supposed to make things
unit vectors.

637
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I'm going to take that A but
I'm going to divide it by square

638
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
root of three.

639
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And I'm going to take this B
but I'm

640
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
going to divide it by square
root of two to make it a unit

641
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
vector, and there is my matrix.

642
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,930
That's my matrix with
orthonormal columns coming from

643
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:24,000
Graham-Schmidt and it sort of it
-- it came from the original

644
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
one, one, one,
one, zero, two,

645
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
right?

646
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That was my original guys.

647
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,710
These were the two I started
with.

648
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,000
These are the two that I'm
happy to end with.

649
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because those are orthonormal.

650
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So that's what Graham-Schmidt
did.

651
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It -- well, tell me about the
column spaces of these matrices.

652
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
How is the column space of Q
related to the column space of

653
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,000
A?
So I'm always asking you things
like this, and that makes you

654
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
think,
OK, the column space is all

655
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
combinations of the columns,
it's that plane,

656
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,000
right?
I've got two vectors in
three-dimensional space,

657
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,000
their column space is a plane,
the column space of this matrix

658
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
is a plane, what's the relation
between the planes?

659
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,970
Between the two column spaces?

660
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,000
They're one and the same,
right?

661
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's the same column space.

662
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
All I'm taking is here this B
thing that I computed,

663
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,260
this B thing that I computed is
a combination of B and A,

664
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,000
and A was little A,
so I'm always working here with

665
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,770
this in the same space.

666
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm just like getting
ninety-degree angles in there.

667
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,530
Where my original column space
had a perfectly good basis,

668
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,000
but it wasn't as good as this
basis, because it wasn't

669
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
orthonormal.

670
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Now this one is orthonormal,
and I have a basis then that --

671
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,070
so now projections,
all the calculations I would

672
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:21,000
ever want to do are -- are a
cinch with this orthonormal

673
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
basis.

674
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
One final point.

675
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,770
One final point
in this chapter.

676
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,000
And it's -- just like
elimination.

677
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We learned how to do
elimination, we know all the

678
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,960
steps, we can do it.

679
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,000
But then I came back to it and
said look at it as a matrix in

680
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
matrix language and elimination
gave me -- what was elimination

681
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
in
matrix language?

682
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'll just put it up there.

683
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
A was LU.

684
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That was matrix,
that was elimination.

685
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now, I want to do the same for
Graham-Schmidt.

686
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,130
Everybody who works in linear
algebra isn't going to write out

687
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,000
the columns are orthogonal,
or orthonormal.

688
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And isn't going to
write out these formulas.

689
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,880
They're going to write out the
connection between the matrix A

690
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,000
and the matrix Q.

691
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And the two matrices have the
same column space,

692
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,580
but there's some -- some matrix
is taking the -- and I'm going

693
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,860
to call it R,
so A equals QR is the magic

694
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,000
formula here.

695
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's the expression of
Graham-Schmidt.

696
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And I'll -- let me just capture
that.

697
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So that's the -- my final step
then is A equal QR.

698
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,090
Maybe I can squeeze it in here.

699
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:08,000
So A has columns,
let's say a1 and a2.

700
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Let me suppose n is two,
just two vectors.

701
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
OK.

702
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So that's some combination of
q1 and q2.

703
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And times some matrix R.

704
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,140
They have the same column
space.

705
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:29,000
This is just -- this matrix
just includes in it whatever

706
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,330
these numbers like three over
three and one over square root

707
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,000
of three and
one over square root of two,

708
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
probably that's what it's got.

709
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
One over square root of three,
one over square root of two,

710
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
something there,
but actually it's got a zero

711
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
there.

712
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So the main point about this A
equal QR is this R turns out to

713
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
be upper
triangular.

714
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It turns out that this zero is
upper triangular.

715
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We could see why.

716
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,050
Let me see, I can put in
general formulas for what these

717
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:16,000
are.

718
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
This I think in here should be
the inner product of a1 with q1.

719
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And this one should be the --
the inner product of a1 with

720
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
q2.

721
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And that's what I believe is
zero.

722
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This will be something here,
and this will be something here

723
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
with inner -- a1 transpose q2,
sorry a2 transpose q1 and a2

724
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
transpose q2.

725
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But why is that guy zero?

726
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Why is a1 q2 zero?

727
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,390
That's the key to this being --
this R here being upper

728
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,000
triangular.

729
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You know why a1q2 is zero,
because a1 -- that was my --

730
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
this was really a and b here.

731
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This was really a and b.

732
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So this is a transpose q2.

733
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And the whole point of
Graham-Schmidt was that we

734
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
constructed these later q-s to
be perpendicular to the earlier

735
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
vectors, to the earlier -- all
the earlier vectors.

736
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,210
So that's why we get a
triangular matrix.

737
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,000
The -- result is extremely
satisfactory.

738
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That if I have a matrix
with independent columns,

739
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
the Graham-Schmidt produces a
matrix with orthonormal columns,

740
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and the connection between
those is a triangular matrix.

741
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That last point,
that the connection is a

742
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
triangular matrix,
please look in the book,

743
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you have to see that one more
time.

744
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
OK.

745
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Thanks, that's great.
