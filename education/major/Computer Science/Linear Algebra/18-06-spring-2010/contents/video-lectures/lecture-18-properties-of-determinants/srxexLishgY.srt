1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
OK, this lecture is like the
beginning of the second half of
this is to prove.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
this course because up to now we
paid a lot of attention to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
rectangular matrices.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, concentrating on square
matrices, so we're at two big

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
topics.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The determinant of a square
matrix, so this is the first

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
lecture in that
new chapter on determinants,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,690
and the reason,
the big reason we need the

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,000
determinants is for the Eigen
values.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,900
So this is really determinants
and Eigen values,

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,680
the next big,
big chunk of 18.06.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,000
OK, so the determinant is a
number associated with every

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
square matrix,
so every square matrix has this

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
number associated with called
the, its determinant.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll often write it as D E T A
or often also I'll write it as,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A with vertical bars,
so that's going to mean the

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
determinant of the matrix.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's going to mean this one,
like, magic number.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, one number can't tell you
what the whole matrix was.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But this one number,
just packs in as much

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
information as possible into a
single number,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and of course the one fact that
you've seen before and we have

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to see it again is the matrix is
invertible when the determinant

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is not zero.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The matrix is singular when the
determinant is zero.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So the determinant will be a
test for invertibility,

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but the determinant's got a lot
more to it than that,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so let me start.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK, now the question is how to
start.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do I give you a big formula for
the determinant,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
all in one
gulp?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,700
I don't think so!

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,000
That big formula has got too
much packed in it.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I would rather start with three
properties of the determinant,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
three properties that it has.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And let me tell you property
one.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The determinant of the identity
is one.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
OK.
I...

39
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:45,000
I wish the other two
properties were as easy to tell

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you as that.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But actually the second
property is pretty

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
straightforward too,
and then once we get the third

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,620
we will actually have the
determinant.

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,000
Those three properties define
the determinant and we can --

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
then we can figure out,
well, what is the determinant?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's a formula for it?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now, the second property is
what happens if you exchange two

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
rows of a matrix.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What happens to the
determinant?

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, property two is exchange
rows, reverse the sign of the

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
determinant.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A lot of plus and minus signs.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I even wrote here,
"plus and minus

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
signs," because this is,
like, that's what you have to

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
pay attention to in the formulas
and properties of determinants.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So that -- you see what I mean
by a property here?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I haven't yet told you what the
determinant is,

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but whatever it is,
if I exchange two rows to get a

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
different matrix that reverses
the sign of the determinant.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And so now, actually,
what matrices do we now know

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the determinant of?

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
From one and two,
I now know the determinant.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, I certainly know the
determinant of the identity

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
matrix and now I know the
determinant of

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
every other matrix that comes
from row exchanges from the

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
identities still.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So what matrices have I gotten
at this point?

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The permutations,
right.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
At this point I know every
permutation matrix,

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
so now I'm saying the
determinant of a permutation

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
matrix is one or minus one.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
One or minus one,
depending whether the number of

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
exchanges was even or the number
of exchanges was odd.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So this is the determinant of a
permutation.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, P is back to standing for
permutation.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
OK.
if I could carry on this board,

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I could, like,
do the two-by-two's.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, property one tells me that
this two-by-two matrix.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, I better write absolute --
I mean, I'd better write

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
vertical bars,
not brackets,

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
for that determinant.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Property one said,
in the two-by-two case,

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that this matrix has
determinant one.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Property two tells me that this
matrix has determinant -- what?

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Negative one.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is, like,
two-by-twos.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,320
Now, I finally want to get --
well, ultimately I want to get

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,000
to, the formula that we all
know.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let me put that way over here,
that the determinant of a

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,750
general
two-by-two is ad-bc.

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,000
OK.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm going to leave that up,
like, as the two by two case

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that we already know,
so that every property,

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can, like,
check that it's correct for

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
two-by-twos.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But the whole point of these
properties is that they're going

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to give me a formula for n-by-n.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's the whole point.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They're going to give me this
number that's a test for

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
invertibility and other great
properties for any size matrix.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
OK, now you see I'm like,
slowing down because property

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
three is the key property.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Property three is the key
property and can I somehow

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
describe it --
maybe I'll separate it into 3A

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and 3B.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Property 3A says that if I
multiply one of the rows,

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
say the first row,
by a number T -- I'm going to

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,230
erase that.

109
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:46,000
That's, like,
what I'm headed for but I'm not

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
there yet.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's the one we know and you'll
see that it's checked out by

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
each property.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
OK, so this is for any matrix.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
For any matrix,
if I multiply one row by T and

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
leave the other row or other n-1
rows alone, what happens to the

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
determinant?

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The factor T comes out.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's T times this determinant.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's not hard.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I shouldn't have made a big
deal out of property 3A,

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and 3B is that,
if is, is if I keep -- I'm

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
always keeping this second row
the same, or that last n-1 rows

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
are all staying the same.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm just working -- I'm just
looking inside the first

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,000
row and if I have an a+a' there
and a b+b' there -- sorry,

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I didn't.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ahh.
Why don't -- I'll use an
eraser, do it right.

128
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,000
b+b' there.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You see what I'm doing?

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This property and this property
are about linear combinations,

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
of the first row only,
leaving the

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
other rows unchanged.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They'll copy along.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then, then I get the sum --
this breaks up into the sum of

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
this determinant and this one.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm putting up formulas.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Maybe I can try to say it in
words.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The determinant is a linear
function.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It behaves like a linear
function of first row if all the

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
other rows stay the same.

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I not saying that -- let me
emphasize.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I not saying that the
determinant of A plus B is

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
determinant of A plus
determinant of B.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I not saying that.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,530
I'd better -- can I -- how do I
get it onto tape that I'm not

146
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,000
saying that?

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You see, this would allow all
the rows -- you know,

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A to have a bunch of rows,
B to have a bunch of rows.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's not the linearity I'm
after.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,450
I'm only after linearity in
each row.

151
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,000
Linear for each row.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, you may say I only talked
about the first row,

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
but I claim it's also linear in
the

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
second row, if I had this --
but not, I can't,

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,240
I can't have a combination in
both first and second.

156
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,000
If I had a combination in the
second row, then I could use

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
rule two to put it up in the
first row, use my property and

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
then use rule two again to put
it back,

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so each row is OK,
not only the first row,

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,240
but each row separately.

161
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
OK, those are the three
properties, and from those

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
properties, so that's properties
one, two, three.

163
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
From those, I want to get all
-- I'm going to learn a lot more

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
about the determinant.

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let me take an example.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,440
What would I like to learn?

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,000
I would like to learn that --
so here's our property four.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let me use the same numbering
as here.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Property four is if two rows
are equal, the determinant is

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
zero.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
OK, so property four.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,950
Two equal rows lead to
determinant equals zero.

173
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,000
Right.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, of course I can --
in the two-by-two case I can

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
check, sure, the determinant of
ab ab comes out zero.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But I want to see why it's true
for n-by-n.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Suppose row one equals row
three for a seven-by-seven

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
matrix.
So two rows are the same in a
big matrix.

179
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,000
And all I have to work with is
these properties.

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The exchange property,
which flips the sign,

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and the linearity property
which works in each row

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
separately.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
OK, can you see the reason?

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How do I get this one out of
properties one,

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
two, three?

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,190
Because -- that's all I have to
work with.

187
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,000
Everything has to come from
properties one,

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
two, three.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
OK, so suppose I have a matrix,
and two rows are even.

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How do I see that its
determinant has to be zero from

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
these properties?

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I do an exchange.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Property two is just set up for
this.

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Use property two.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,900
Use exchange -- exchange rows.

196
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,000
Exchange those rows,
and I get the same matrix.

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,220
Of course, because those rows
were equal.

198
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,000
So the determinant didn't
change.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But on the other hand,
property two says that the sign

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
did change.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,350
So the -- so I,
I have a determinant whose sign

202
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:02,000
doesn't change and does change,
and the only possibility then

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
is that the determinant is zero.

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You see the reasoning there?

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Straightforward.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Property two just told us,
hey, if we've got two equal

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:00:00,000
rows we.
we've got a zero determinant.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And of course in our minds,
that matches the fact that if I

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
have two equal rows the matrix
isn't invertible.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If I have two equal rows,
I know that the rank is less

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
than n.

212
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OK, ready for property five.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now, property five you'll
recognize as P.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It says that the elimination
step that I'm always doing,

215
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
subtract a multiple,
subtract some multiple l times

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
row one from another row,
row k, let's say.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You remember why I did that.

218
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
In elimination I'm always
choosing

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
this multiplier so as to
produce zero in that position.

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or row I from row k,
maybe I should just make very

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
clear that there's nothing
special about row one here.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
OK, so that,
you can see why I want that

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,230
one, because that will allow me
to start with this full matrix

224
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,000
whose
determinant I don't know,

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and I can do elimination and
clean it out.

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can get zeroes below the
diagonal by these elimination

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
steps and the point is that the
determinant, the determinant

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
doesn't change.

229
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So all those steps of
elimination are OK not changing

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
the determinant.

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In our language in the early
chapter the determinant of A is

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
going to be the same as the
determinant of U,

233
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the upper triangular one.

234
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It just has the pivots on the
diagonal.

235
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's why we'll want this
property.

236
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
OK, do you see where that
property's coming from?

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let me do the two-by-two case.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me do the two-by-two case
here.

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,100
So, I'll keep property five
going along.

240
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,000
So what I doing?

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm going to keep -- I'm going
to have ab cd,

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but I'm going to subtract l
times the first row from the

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
second row.

244
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And that's the determinant and
of

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
course I can multiply that out
and figure out,

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
sure enough,
ad-bc is there and this minus

247
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
ALB plus ALB cancels out,
but I just cheated,

248
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,000
right?
I've got to use the properties.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So what property?

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, of course,
this is a com -- I'm keeping

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the first row the same and the
second

252
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
row has a c and a d,
and then there's the

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
determinant of the A and the B,
and the minus LA,

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and the minus LB.

255
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So what property was that?
3B.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I kept one row the same and I
had a combination in the second,

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
in the other row,
and I just separated it out.

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OK, so that's property 3.

259
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's by number 3,
3B if you like.

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
OK, now use 3A.

261
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How do you use 3A,
which says I can factor out an

262
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
l, I can factor out a minus l
here.

263
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can factor a minus l out from
this row, no problem.

264
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,520
That was 3A.

265
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:26,000
So now I've used property three
and now I'm ready for the kill.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Property four says that this
determinant is zero,

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
has two equal rows.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You see how that would always
work?

269
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I subtract a multiple of one
row from another one.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It gives me a combination in
row k of the old row and l times

271
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
this copy of the higher row,
and then if -- since I have two

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
equal rows, that's zero,
so the determinant after

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
elimination is the same as
before.

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Good.

275
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OK.
Now, let's see -- if I rescue
my glasses, I can see what's

276
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,000
property six.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, six is easy,
plenty of space.

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Row of zeroes leads to
determinant of A equals zero.

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A complete row of zeroes.

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I'm again,
this is like,

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
something I'll use in the
singular case.

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, you can look ahead to
why I need these properties.

283
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So I'm going to use property
five, the elimination,

284
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
use this stuff to say that this
determinant is the same as that

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
determinant and I'll
produce a zero there.

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But what if I also produce a
zero there?

287
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What if elimination gives a row
of zeroes?

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That, that used to be my test
for, mmm, singular,

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
not invertible,
rank two -- rank less than N,

290
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and now I'm seeing it's also
gives determinant zero.

291
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How do I get that one from the
previous properties?

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
'Cause I -- this is not a new
law, this has got to come from

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the old ones.

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So what shall I do?

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, use -- that's brilliant.

296
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you use 3A with T equals
zero.

297
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Right.

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So I have this zero zero cd,
and I'm trying to show that

299
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that
determinant is zero.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
OK, so the zero is the same is
-- five, can I take T equals

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
five, just to,
like, pin it down?

302
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll multiply this row by five.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Five, well then,
five of this should -- if I,

304
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
if there's a factor five in
that, you see what -- so this is

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,520
property 3A, with taking T as
five.

306
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,000
If I multiply a row by five,
out comes a five.

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So why I doing this?

308
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, because that's still zero
zero, right?

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,580
So that's this determinant
equals five times this

310
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,000
determinant, and the determinant
has to be zero.

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think I didn't do that the
very best way.

312
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You were, yeah,
you had the idea better.

313
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Multiply, yeah,
take T equals zero.

314
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Was that your idea?

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Take T equals zero in rule 3B.

316
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,490
If T is zero in rule 3B,
and I bring the camera back to

317
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,000
rule 3B -- sorry.

318
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If T is zero,
then I have a zero zero there

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and the determinant is zero.

320
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
OK, one way or another,
a row of zeroes means zero

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
determinant.

322
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
OK, now I have to get serious.

323
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The next properties are the
ones that we're building up to.

324
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
OK, so I can do elimination.

325
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can reduce to a triangular
matrix and now what's the

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
determinant of that triangular
matrix?

327
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Suppose, suppose I -- all
right, rule seven.

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,750
So suppose my matrix is now
triangular.

329
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,000
So it's got -- so I even give
these the names of the pivots,

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
d1, d2, to dn,
and stuff is up here,

331
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know what that is,
but what I do know is this is

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,140
all zeroes.

333
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,000
That's all zeroes,
and I would like to know the

334
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
determinant, because elimination
will get me to this.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,840
So once I'm here,
what's the determinant then?

336
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,260
Let me use an eraser to get
those,

337
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,000
get that vertical bar again,
so that I'm taking the

338
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
determinant of U so that,
so, what is the determinant of

339
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
an upper triangular matrix?

340
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do you know the answer?

341
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,970
It's just the product of the
d's.

342
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:45,000
The -- these things that I
don't even put in letters for,

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because they don't matter,
the determinant is d1 times d2

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
times
dn.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If I have a triangular matrix,
then the diagonal is all I have

346
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
to work with.

347
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And that's, that's telling us
then.

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We now have the way that
MATLAB, any reasonable software,

349
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
would compute a determinant.

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I have a matrix of size a
hundred, the way I would

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
actually compute its
determinant would be

352
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
elimination, make it triangular,
multiply the pivots together,

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the product of the pivots,
the product of pivots.

354
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Now, there's always in
determinants a plus or minus

355
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
sign to remember.

356
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Where -- where does that come
into this rule?

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Could it be,
could the determinant be minus

358
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the product of the pivots?

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The determinant is d1,
d2, to dn.

360
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,740
No doubt about that.

361
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,730
But to get to this triangular
form, we may have had to do a

362
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,000
row exchange,
so, so this -- it's the product

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
of the pivots if there were no
row exchanges.

364
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If, if SLU code,
the simple LU code,

365
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the square LU went right
through.

366
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
If we had to do some row
exchanges, then we've got to

367
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
watch plus or minus.

368
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
OK, but though -- this law is
simply that.

369
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
OK, how do I prove that?

370
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's see, let me suppose that
d's are not

371
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
zeroes.

372
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The pivots are not zeroes.

373
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And tell me,
how do I show that none of this

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,700
upper stuff makes any
difference?

375
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,000
How do I get zeroes there?

376
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
By elimination,
right?

377
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,900
I just multiply this row by the
right number,

378
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,000
subtract from that row,
kills that.

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I multiply this row by the
right

380
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
number, kills that,
by the right number,

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
kills that.

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Now, you kill every one of
these off-diagonal terms,

383
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,600
no problem and I'm just left
with the diagonal.

384
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Well, strictly speaking,
I still have to figure out why

385
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
is, for a diagonal matrix now,
why is that the right

386
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
determinant?

387
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I mean, we sure hope it is,
but why?

388
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I have to go back to properties
one, two, three.

389
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why is -- now that the matrix
is suddenly diagonal,

390
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
how do I know that the
determinant is just a product of
That's my proof,
really, that once I've got

391
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
those diagonal entries?

392
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, what I going to use?

393
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm going to use property 3A,
is

394
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,010
that right?

395
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,000
I'll factor this,
I'll factor this,

396
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll factor that d1 out and
have one and have the first row

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
will be that.

398
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And then I'll factor out the
d2, shall I shall I put the d2

399
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
here, and the second row will
look like that,

400
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and so on.

401
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So I've factored out all the
d's and

402
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
what I left with?

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The identity.

404
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And what rule do I finally get
to use?

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Rule one.

406
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,590
Finally, this is the point
where rule one finally chips in

407
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,000
and says that this determinant
is one, so it's the product of

408
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the d's.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So this was rules five,
to do elimination,

410
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,150
3A to factor out
the D's, and,

411
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,000
and our best friend,
rule one.

412
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And possibly rule two,
the exchanges may have been

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
needed also.

414
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
OK.

415
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Now I guess I have to consider
also the case if some d is zero,

416
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
because I was assuming I could
use the d's to clean out and

417
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
make a diagonal,
but what if --

418
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
what if one of those diagonal
entries is zero?

419
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, then with elimination we
know that we can get a row of

420
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
zeroes, and for a row of zeroes
I'm using rule six,

421
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,730
the determinant is zero,
and that's right.

422
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,950
So I can check the singular
case.

423
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:37,000
In fact, I can now get to the
key point that determinant of A

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
is zero,
exactly when,

425
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
exactly when A is singular.

426
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And otherwise is not singular,
so that the determinant is a

427
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
fair test for invertibility or
non-invertibility.

428
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So, I must be close to that
because I can take any matrix

429
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and get there.

430
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do I -- did I have anything to
say?

431
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The, the proofs,
it starts by saying by

432
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
elimination go from A to U.

433
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, yeah.

434
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Actually looks to me like I
don't -- haven't said anything

435
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
brand-new here,
that, that really,

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,320
I've got this,
because let's just remember the

437
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,000
reason.

438
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,400
By elimination,
I can go from the original A to

439
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,000
U.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, OK, now suppose the
matrix is

441
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
singular.

442
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
If the matrix is singular,
what happens?

443
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Then by elimination I get a row
of zeroes and therefore the

444
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
determinant is zero.

445
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And if the matrix is not
singular, I don't get zero,

446
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
so maybe -- do you want me to
put this, like,

447
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,740
in two parts?

448
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,000
The determinant of A is not
zero

449
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
when A is invertible.

450
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Because I've already -- in
chapter two we figured out when

451
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
is the matrix invertible.

452
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,140
It's invertible when
elimination produces a full set

453
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,000
of pivots and now,
and we now, we know the

454
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
determinant is the product of
those non-zero numbers.

455
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So those are the two cases.

456
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
If it's singular,
I go to a row of zeroes.

457
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
If it's invertible,
I go to U and then to the

458
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
diagonal D, and then which --
and then to d1,

459
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
d2, up to dn.

460
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
As the formula -- so we have a
formula now.

461
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We have a formula for the
determinant and it's actually a

462
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
very much more practical formula
than the

463
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
ad-bc formula.

464
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Is it correct,
maybe you should just -- let's

465
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
just check that.

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Two-by-two.

467
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What are the pivots of a
two-by-two matrix?

468
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What does elimination do with a
two-by-two matrix?

469
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It -- there's the first pivot,
fine.

470
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What's the second pivot?

471
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We subtract,
so I'm putting it in this upper

472
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
triangular form.

473
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What do I -- my multiplier is c
over a, right?

474
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I multiply that row by c over a
and I subtract to get that zero,

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,630
and here I have d minus c over
a times b.

476
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,000
That's the elimination on a
two-by-two.

477
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So I've finally discovered that
the determinant of this matrix

478
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
-- I've got it from the
properties, not by knowing the

479
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
answer from last year,
that the determinant of this

480
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
two-by-two is the product of A
times that, and of course when I

481
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
multiply A by that,
the product of that and that

482
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is ad minus,
the a is canceled,

483
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,000
bc.
So that's great,
provided a isn't zero.

484
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If a was zero,
that step wasn't allowed,

485
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
zero wasn't a pivot.

486
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So that's what I -- I've
covered all the bases.

487
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,580
I have to -- if a is zero,
then I have to do the exchange,

488
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,000
and if the exchange doesn't
work, it's because a is

489
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
singular.

490
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
OK, those are -- those are the
direct properties of the

491
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,590
determinant.

492
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,000
And now, finally,
I've got two more,

493
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,970
nine and ten.

494
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,000
And that's -- I think you
can...

495
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Like, the ones
we've got here are totally

496
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
connected with our elimination
process and whether pivots are

497
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,460
available and whether we get a
row of zeroes.

498
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,000
I think all that you can
swallow in one shot.

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Let me tell you properties nine
and ten.

500
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They're quick to write down.

501
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They're very,
very useful.

502
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So I'll just write them down
and use them.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,360
Property nine says that the
determinant of a product -- if I
That's the, like,
concrete proof that,

504
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,000
multiply two matrices.

505
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So if I multiply two matrices,
A and B, that the determinant

506
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,199
of the product is determinant of
A times determinant of B,

507
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,000
and for me that one is like,
that's a very valuable

508
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
property, and it's sort of like
partly coming

509
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
out of the blue,
because we haven't been

510
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
multiplying matrices and here
suddenly this determinant has

511
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
this multiplying property.

512
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Remember, it didn't have the
linear property,

513
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
it didn't have the adding
property.

514
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,670
The determinant of A plus B is
not the sum of the determinants,

515
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,570
but the determinant of A times
B is the product,

516
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,000
is the product of the
determinants.

517
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
OK, so for example,
what's the determinant of A

518
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
inverse?

519
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Using that property nine.

520
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Let me, let me put that under
here because the camera is

521
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
happier if it can focus on both
at once.

522
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So let me put it underneath.

523
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The determinant of A inverse,
because property ten will come

524
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in that space.

525
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What does this tell me about A
inverse, its determinant?

526
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
OK, well, what do I know about
A inverse?

527
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I know that A inverse times A
is odd.

528
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So what I going to do?

529
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm going to take determinants
of

530
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
both sides.

531
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,780
The determinant of I is one,
and what's the determinant of A

532
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,000
inverse A?

533
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That's a product of two
matrices, A and B.

534
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So it's the product of the
determinant, so what I learning?

535
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,850
I'm learning that the
determinant of A inverse times

536
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,000
the determinant of A is the
determinant of

537
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I, that's this one.

538
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Again, I happily use property
one.

539
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
OK, so that tells me that the
determinant of A inverse is one

540
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
over.

541
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Here's my -- here's my
conclusion -- is one over the

542
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
determinant of A.

543
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I guess that that --
I, I always try to think,

544
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
well, do we know some cases of
that?

545
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Of course, we know it's right
already if A is diagonal.

546
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
If A is a diagonal matrix,
then its determinant is just a

547
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
product of those numbers.

548
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So if A is, for example,
two-three, then we know that

549
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
A-inverse is one-half
one-third, and sure enough,

550
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that has determinant six,
and that has determinant

551
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
one-sixth.

552
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,840
And our rule checks.

553
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,000
So somehow this proof,
this property has to -- somehow

554
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the proof of that property -- if
we can boil it down to diagonal

555
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
matrices then we can read it
off,

556
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
whether it's A and A-inverse,
or two different diagonal

557
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
matrices A and B.

558
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
For diagonal -- so what I
saying?

559
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm saying for a diagonal
matrices, check.

560
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But we'd have to do elimination
steps, we'd have to patiently do

561
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the, the, argument if we want to
use these previous properties to

562
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
get it
for other matrices.

563
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And it also tells me -- what,
just let's, see what else it's

564
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
telling me.

565
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What's the determinant of,
of A-squared?

566
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
If I take a matrix and square
it?

567
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Then the determinant just got
squared.

568
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Right?
The determinant of A-squared is
the

569
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
determinant of A times the
determinant of A.

570
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So if I square the matrix,
I square the determinant.

571
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If I double the matrix,
what do I do to the

572
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
determinant?

573
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Think about that one.

574
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
If I double the matrix,
what -- so the determinant of

575
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
A, since I'm writing down,
like, facts

576
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that follow,
the determinant of A-squared is

577
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the determinant of A,
all squared.

578
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The determinant of 2A is what?

579
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That's A plus A.

580
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But wait, er,
I don't want the answer to

581
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,830
determinant of A here.

582
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,000
That's wrong.

583
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's not two determinant of A,
What is it?

584
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,630
what's the number that I have
to multiply determinant of A by

585
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,000
if I double the whole matrix,
if I double every entry in the

586
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
matrix?

587
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What happens to the
determinant?
If that were possible,
that would be a bad thing,

588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Supposed it's an n-by-n matrix.

589
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Two to the n,
right.

590
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Two to the nth.

591
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Now, why is it two to the nth,
and not just two?

592
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So why is it two to the nth?

593
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Because I'm factoring out two
from every row.

594
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
There's a factor -- this has a
factor two in every row,

595
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
so I can factor two out of the
first row.

596
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I factor a different two out of
the second row,

597
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,990
a different two out of the nth
row, so I've got all those twos

598
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,000
coming out.

599
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So it's like volume,
really, and that's one of the

600
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
great applications of
determinants.

601
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
If I -- if I have a box and I
double all the sides,

602
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I multiply the volume by two to
the nth.

603
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
If it's a box in three
dimensions, I multiply the

604
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
volume by 8.

605
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So this is rule 3A here.

606
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This is rule nine.

607
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And notice the way this rule
sort of checks out with the

608
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
singular/non-singular stuff,
that if A is invertible,

609
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
what does that mean about its
determinant?

610
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's not zero,
and therefore this makes sense.

611
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The case when determinant of A
is zero, that's the case where

612
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
my formula doesn't work anymore.

613
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
If determinant of A is zero,
this is ridiculous,

614
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and that's ridiculous.

615
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
A-inverse doesn't exist,
and one over zero doesn't make

616
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,130
sense.

617
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,000
So don't miss this property.

618
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's sort of,
like, amazing that it can...

619
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And the tenth property is
equally simple to state,

620
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
that the determinant of A
transposed equals the

621
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
determinant of A.

622
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And of course,
let's just check it on the ab

623
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
cd guy.

624
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We could check that sure
enough, that's ab cd,

625
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
it works.

626
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's ad - bc,
it's ad - bc,

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
sure enough.

628
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So that transposing did not
change the determinant.

629
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But what it does change is --
well, what it does is it lists,

630
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
so all -- I've been working
with rows.

631
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If a row is all zeroes,
the determinant is zero.

632
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But now, with rule ten,
I know what to do is a column

633
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
is all zero.

634
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
If a column is all zero,
what's the determinant?

635
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Zero, again.

636
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So, like all those properties
about rows, exchanging two rows

637
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
reverses the sign.

638
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Now, exchanging two columns
reverses the sign,

639
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
because I can always,
if I want to see why,

640
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I can transpose,
those columns become rows,

641
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I do the exchange,
I transpose back.

642
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And I've done a column
operation.

643
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So, in, in conclusion,
there was nothing special about

644
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
row one, 'cause I could exchange
rows, and now there's nothing

645
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,090
special about rows that isn't
equally true for

646
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,000
columns because this is the
same.

647
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,000
OK.
And again, maybe I won't -- oh,
let's see.

648
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Do we...?

649
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Maybe it's worth seeing a quick
proof of this number ten,

650
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
quick, quick,
er, proof of number ten.

651
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Er, let me take the -- this is
number ten.

652
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
A transposed
equals A.

653
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,990
Determinate of A transposed
equals determinate of A.

654
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,000
That's what I should have said.

655
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
OK.

656
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So, let's just,
er.

657
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
A typical matrix A,
if I use elimination,

658
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
this factors into LU.

659
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And the transpose is U
transpose, l transpose.

660
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,210
Er...
let me.

661
00:44:25,210 --> 00:00:00,000


662
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So this is proof,
this is proof number ten,

663
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
using -- well,
I don't know which ones I'll

664
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
use, so I'll put 'em all in,
one to nine.

665
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,000
OK.
I'm going to prove number ten
by using one to nine.

666
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I won't cover every case,
but I'll cover almost every

667
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,000
case.
So in almost every case,
A can

668
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
factor into LU,
and A transposed can factor

669
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
into that.

670
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Now, what do I do next?

671
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I want to prove that these
are the same.

672
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I see a product here.

673
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So I use rule nine.

674
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So, now what I want to prove
is, so now I know that this is

675
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
LU, this is U transposed and l
transposed.

676
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Now, just for a practice,
what are all those

677
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
determinants?

678
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So this is, this is,
this is prove this,

679
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
prove this, prove this,
and now I'm ready to do it.

680
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
What's the determinant of l?

681
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You remember what l is,
it's this lower triangular

682
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
matrix with ones on the
diagonals.

683
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So what is the determinant of
that guy?

684
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I- It's one.

685
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Any time I have this triangular
matrix, I can get rid of all the

686
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,980
non-zeroes, down to the diagonal
case.

687
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,000
The determinate of l is one.

688
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
How about the determinant of l
transposed?

689
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,500
That's triangular also,
right?

690
00:46:06,500 --> 00:38:45,000
Still got those ones on the
diagonal, it's just the

691
00:38:45,000 --> 00:31:07,000
non-zeroes flipped to the other
side of the diagonal,

692
00:31:07,000 --> 00:26:43,000
but they didn't matter anyway.

693
00:20:33,000 --> 00:14:49,000
triangular matrices,
l and l transposed,

694
00:14:49,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or U and U transposed,
when they're triangular,4

695
00:06:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm down to the product of the
diagonal and if I transpose,

696
00:15:30,000 --> 00:17:04,000
who cares?

697
00:17:04,000 --> 00:24:43,000
OK, that's not -- I didn't put
in every comma and,

698
00:24:43,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and cross every T in that
proof, but that's really the

699
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:57,000
proof.

700
00:39:44,000 --> 00:46:55,000
that gets -- get down to
triangular

701
00:46:55,000 --> 00:39:25,000
matrices and then get down to
diagonal matrices.

702
00:39:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
OK, one more coming,
which I I have to make,

703
00:32:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
because all math professors
watching this will be waiting

704
00:23:36,000 --> 00:22:29,000
for it.

705
00:22:29,000 --> 00:15:18,000
OK, so they had to wait until
the last minute.

706
00:15:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What I -- way,
way back in property two,4

707
00:07:20,000 --> 00:14:29,140
I said that if you do a row
exchange, the determinant

708
00:14:29,140 --> 00:16:16,000
changes sign.

709
00:16:16,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So if I do seven row exchanges,
the determinant changes sign,

710
00:24:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but it -- would it be possible
t- to produce the same matrix

711
00:32:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
with seven row exchanges and
with ten row exchanges?

712
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,000
right?
If If I could -- why would it
be bad?

713
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
My whole lecture would die,
right?

714
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Because rule two said that if
you do seven row exchanges,

715
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
then the sign of the
determinant reverses.

716
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
But if you do ten row
exchanges, the sign of the

717
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
determinant stays the same,
because minus one

718
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
ten times is plus one.

719
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
OK, so there's a hidden fact
here, that every -- like,

720
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
every permutation,
the permutations are either odd

721
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
or even.

722
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I could get the permutation
with seven row exchanges,

723
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
then I could probably get it
with twenty-one,

724
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
or twenty-three,
or a hundred and one,

725
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
if it's an odd one.

726
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Or an even number of
permutations,

727
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
so, but that's the key fact
that just takes another little

728
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
algebraic trick to see,
and that means that the

729
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
determinant is well-defined by
properties one,

730
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
two, three and it's got
properties

731
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
four to ten.

732
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
OK, that's today and I'll try
to get the homework for next

733
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Wednesday onto the web this
afternoon.

734
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Thanks.
