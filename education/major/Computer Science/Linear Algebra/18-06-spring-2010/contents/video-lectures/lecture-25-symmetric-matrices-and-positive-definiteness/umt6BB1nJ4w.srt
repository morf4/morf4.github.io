1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
-- one and -- the lecture on
symmetric matrixes.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So that's the most important
class of matrixes,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
symmetric matrixes.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A equals A transpose.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the first points,
the main points of the lecture

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll tell you right away.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,400
What's special about the
eigenvalues?

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,000
What's special about the
eigenvectors?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is -- the way we now look
at a matrix.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We want to know about its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors and

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
if we have a special type of
matrix, that should tell us

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,400
something about eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,000
Like Markov matrixes,
they have an eigenvalue equal

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
one.
Now symmetric matrixes,
can I just tell you right off

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
what the main facts -- the two
main facts are?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix, real -- this is a real

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
symmetric matrix,
we -- talking mostly about real

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
matrixes.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The eigenvalues are also real.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So our examples of rotation
matrixes, where -- where we got

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
E- eigenvalues that were
complex, that won't happen now.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For symmetric matrixes,
the eigenvalues are real and

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
the eigenvectors are also very
special.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,289
The eigenvectors are
perpendicular,

25
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:45,380
orthogonal, so which do you
prefer?

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll say perpendicular.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Perp- well, they're both long
words.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, right.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So -- I have a -- you should
say "why?" and I'll at least

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
answer why for case one,
maybe case two,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,320
the checking the Eigen -- that
the eigenvectors are

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,150
perpendicular,
I'll leave to,

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,000
the -- to the book.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But let's just realize what --
well, first I have to say,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it -- it could happen,
like for the identity matrix --

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
there's a symmetric matrix.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Its eigenvalues are certainly
all real, they're all one for

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the identity matrix.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,820
What about the eigenvectors?

40
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, for the identity,
every vector is an eigenvector.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So how can I say they're
perpendicular?

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What I really mean is the --
they -- this word are should

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
really be written can be chosen
perpendicular.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That is, if we have -- it's the
usual case.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If the eigenvalues are all
different, then each eigenvalue

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
has one line of eigenvectors and
those lines are perpendicular

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
here.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But if an eigenvalue's
repeated, then there's a whole

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
plane of eigenvectors and all
I'm saying is that in that

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
plain, we can choose
perpendicular ones.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So that's why it's a can be
chosen part, is -- this is in

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the case of a repeated
eigenvalue where there's some

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
real, substantial freedom.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But the typical case is
different eigenvalues,

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
all real, one dimensional
eigenvector space,

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Eigen spaces,
and all perpendicular.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, just -- let's just see the
conclusion.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If we accept those as correct,
what happens -- and I also mean

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
that there's a full set of them.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I -- so that's part of this
picture here,

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that there -- there's a
complete set of eigenvectors,

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
perpendicular ones.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, having a complete set of
eigenvectors means -- so normal

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,600
-- so the usual -- maybe I put
the -- usually -- usual --

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,000
usual case is that the matrix A
we can write in terms of its

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
eigenvalue matrix and its
eigenvector matrix this way,

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,630
right?

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,000
We can do that in the usual
case, but now what's special

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
when the matrix is symmetric?

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So this is the usual case,
and now let me go to the

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,300
symmetric case.

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,000
So in the symmetric case,
A, this -- this should become

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
somehow a little special.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, the lambdas on the
diagonal are still on the

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
diagonal.
They're -- they're real,
but that's where they are.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What about the eigenvector
matrix?

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,550
So what can I do now special
about

78
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,000
the eigenvector matrix when --
when the A itself is symmetric,

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that says something good about
the eigenvector matrix,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so what is this -- what does
this lead to?

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This -- these perpendicular
eigenvectors,

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can not only -- I can not
only guarantee they're

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
perpendicular,
I could also make them unit

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
vectors, no problem,
just s- scale their length to

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
one.
So what do I have?

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have orthonormal
eigenvectors.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And what does that tell me
about the eigenvector matrix?

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What -- what letter should I
now use in place of S --

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
remember
S has the eigenvectors in its

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
columns, but now those columns
are orthonormal,

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
so the right letter to use is
Q.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So that's where -- so we've got
the letter all set up,

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
so this should be Q lambda Q
inverse.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Q standing in our minds always
for this matrix -- in this case

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it's square,
it's -- so these are the
Okay.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
columns of Q,
of course.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And one more thing.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's Q inverse?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
For a matrix that has these
orthonormal columns,

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
we know that the inverse is the
same as the transpose.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So here is the beautiful --
there is the -- the great

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
description,
the factorization of a

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
symmetric matrix.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And this is,
like, one of the famous

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
theorems of linear algebra,
that if I have a symmetric

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
matrix, it can be factored in
this form.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
An orthogonal matrix times
diagonal times the transpose of

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that orthogonal matrix.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And, of course,
everybody immediately says yes,

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and if this is possible,
then that's clearly symmetric,

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
right?

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That -- take -- we've looked at
products of three guys like that

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,560
and taken their transpose and we
got

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,000
it back again.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So do you -- do you see the
beauty of this -- of this

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
factorization,
then?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It -- it completely displays
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the symmetry of the -- of the
whole thing, because -- that

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
product, Q times lambda times Q
transpose,

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
if I transpose it,
it -- this comes in this

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
position and we get that matrix
back again.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,040
So that's -- in mathematics,
that's called the spectral

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,000
theorem.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Spectrum is the set of
eigenvalues of a matrix.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Spec- it somehow comes from the
idea

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
of the spectrum of light as a
combination of pure things --

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
where our matrix is broken down
into pure eigenvalues and

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
eigenvectors -- in mechanics
it's often called the principle

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
axis theorem.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's very useful.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It means that if you have --
we'll see it geometrically.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,370
It means that if I have some
material -- if I look at the

133
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,840
right axis, it becomes diagonal,
it becomes -- the -- the

134
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,000
directions don't couple
together.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.
So that's -- that -- that's
what to remember from -- from

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
this lecture.

137
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,000
Now, I would like to say why
are the eigenvalues real?

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I do that?

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So -- so -- because that --
something useful comes out.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I'll just come back -- come
to that question why real

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
eigenvalues?

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I have to start from the
only thing we know,

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,890
Ax equal lambda x.

145
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,490
But as far as I know at this
moment, lambda could be complex.

147
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to prove it's not --
and x could be complex.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,050
In fact, for the moment,
even A could be -- we could

149
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,000
even think, well,
what

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
happens if A is complex?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,970
Well, one thing we can always
do -- this is -- this is like

152
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,000
always -- always okay -- I can
-- if I have an equation,

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can take the complex
conjugate of everything.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's -- no -- no -- so A
conjugate x conjugate equal

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
lambda
conjugate x conjugate,

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
it just means that everywhere
over here that there was a -- an

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
i, then here I changed it to
a-i.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's -- that -- you know that
that step -- that conjugate

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
business, that a+ib,
if I conjugate it it's a-ib.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's the meaning of conjugate
-- and products behave right,

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,410
I can conjugate every factor.

162
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:46,060
So I haven't done anything yet
except to say what would be true

163
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,000
if, x -- in any case,
even if x and lambda were

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,980
complex.

165
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,000
Of course, our -- we're
speaking about real matrixes A,

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
so I can take that out.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Actually, this already tells me
something about real matrixes.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I haven't used any assumption
of A -- A transpose yet.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Symmetry is waiting in the
wings to be used.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This tells me that if a real
matrix has an eigenvalue lambda

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and an eigenvector x,
it also has -- another of its

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
eigenvalues is lambda bar with
eigenvector x bar.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Real matrixes,
the eigenvalues come in lambda,

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
lambda bar -- the complex
eigenvalues come in lambda and

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
lambda bar pairs.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But, of course,
I'm aiming to show that they're

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,810
not
complex at all,

178
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,000
here, by getting symmetry in.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So how I going to use symmetry?

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going to transpose this
equation to x bar transpose A

181
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
transpose equals x bar transpose
lambda bar.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's just a number,
so I don't mind wear I put that

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
number.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is --
this is -- this is a -- then

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
again okay.
Ax equals lambda x bar
transpose x, right?

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But now I'm ready to use
symmetry.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm ready -- so this was all
just mechanics.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Now -- now comes the moment to
say, okay, if the matrix is

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
symmetric, then this A transpose
is the same as A.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You see, at that moment I used
the

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
assumption.

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,860
Now let me finish the
discussion.

193
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,000
Here -- here's the way I
finish.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I look at this original
equation and I take the inner

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
product.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I multiply both sides by -- oh,
maybe I'll do it with this one.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I take -- I multiply both sides
by x bar transpose.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
x bar transpose Ax bar equals
lambda bar x bar transpose x

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
bar.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, fine.

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right, now what's the other
one?

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, for the other one I'll
probably use this guy.

203
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A- I happy about this?

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No.
For some reason I'm not.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm -- I want to --
if I take the inner product of

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:10:13,000
this from the right with x bar,
I get x bar transpose Ax bar

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:08:48,000
equals x bar transpose lambda
bar x bar.

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I- I've done something dumb,
because I've got the -- I
should've taken the dot product
of this guy here with -- that's

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
haven't learned anything.

210
00:05:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've got -- those two equations
are identical,1

211
00:03:58,000 --> 00:06:14,000
so forgive me for doing such a
thing, but, I'll look at the

212
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:26,000
book.

213
00:06:38,490 --> 00:08:48,000
So I took the dot product --
ye, somehow, it didn't -- I

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:12:08,000
what I was going to do.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So that -- that was -- that's
fine.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That comes directly from that,
multiplying both sides by x bar

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
transpose, but now I'd like to
get -- why do I have x bars over

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
there?

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, yes.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Forget this.

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay.
On this one -- right.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
On this one,
I took it like that,

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,460
I multiply on the right by x.

225
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,000
That's the idea.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay.
Now why I happier with this
situation now?

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A proof is coming here.

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because I compare this guy with
this one.

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And they have the same left
hand side.

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So they have the same
right hand side.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So comparing those two,
can -- I'll raise the board to

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
do this comparison -- this
thing, lambda x bar transpose x

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
is equal to lambda bar x bar
transpose x.

234
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And the conclusion I'm going to
reach -- I -- I

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
on the right track here?

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The conclusion I'm going to
reach is lambda equal lambda

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
bar.

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I would have to track down the
other possibility that this --

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,750
this thing is zero,
but let me -- oh -- oh,

241
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,000
yes, that's important.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's not zero.

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So once I know that this isn't
zero, I just cancel it and I

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
learn that lambda equals lambda
bar.

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,590
And so what can you -- do you
-- have you got the reasoning

246
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,000
altogether?

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What does this tell us?

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Lambda's an eigenvalue of this
symmetric matrix.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We've just proved that it
equaled lambda bar,

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
so we have just proved that
lambda is real,

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,000
right?
If, if a number is equal to its
own complex conjugate,

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
then there's no imaginary part
at all.

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The number is real.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So lambda is real.

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Good.
Good.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Now, what -- but it depended on
this little

257
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,000
expression, on knowing that
that wasn't zero,

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
so that I could cancel it out
-- so can we just take a second

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,599
on that one?

260
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,000
Because it's an important
quantity.

261
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
x bar transpose x.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay, now remember,
as far as we know,

263
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
x is complex.

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So this is --
here -- x is complex,

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
x has these components,
x1, x2 down to xn.

266
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And x bar transpose,
well, it's transposed and it's

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
conjugated, so that's x1
conjugated x2 conjugated up to

268
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
xn conjugated.

269
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm -- I'm -- I'm really
reminding you of crucial

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
facts about complex numbers
that are going to come into the

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
next lecture as well as this
one.

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So w- what can you tell me
about that product -- I -- I

273
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
guess what I'm trying to say is,
if I had a complex vector,

274
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
this would be the quantity I
would -- I would like.

275
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is the quantity I like.

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I would take the vector times
its transpose -- now what --

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
what happens usually if I take a
vector -- a -- a -- x transpose

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,000
x?
I mean, that's a quantity we
see all the time,

279
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
x transpose x.

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's the length of x squared,
right?

281
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's this positive length
squared,

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it's Pythagoras,
it's x1 squared plus x2 squared

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and so on.

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Now our vector's complex,
and you see the effect?

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm conjugating one of these
guys.

286
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So now when I do this
multiplication,

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have x1 bar times x1 and x2
bar times x2 and so on.

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So this is an -- this is sum
a+ib.

289
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And this is sum a-ib.

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I mean, what's the point here?

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What's the point -- when I
multiply a number by its

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
conjugate, a complex number by
its conjugate,

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
what do I get?

294
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I get a n- the -- the imaginary
part is gone.

295
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When I multiply a+ib by its
conjugate, what's -- what's the

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
result of that -- of each of
those separate little

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
multiplications?

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's an a squared and -- and
what -- how many -- what's -- b

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
squared comes in with a plus or
a minus?

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
A plus.
i times minus i is a plus b

301
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
squared.

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And what about the imaginary
part?

303
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Gone, right?

304
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
An iab and a minus iab.

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So this -- this is the right
thing to do.

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you want a decent answer,
then multiply numbers by their

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
conjugates.

308
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Multiply vectors by the
conjugates of x transpose.

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So this quantity is positive,
this quantity is positive --

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the whole thing is positive
except for the zero vector and

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
that allows me to know that this
is a positive number,

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
which I safely cancel out and I
reach the conclusion.

313
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So actually,
in this discussion here,

314
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I've done two things.

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If I reached the conclusion
that lambda's real,

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
which I wanted to do.

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But at the same time,
we sort of saw what to do if

318
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
things were complex.

319
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If a vector is complex,
then it's x bar transpose x,

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,730
this is its length squared.

321
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,000
And as I said,
the next lecture Monday,

322
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
we'll -- we'll repeat that this
is the right thing and then do

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the right thing for matrixes and
all other -- all other,

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
complex possibilities.

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Okay.
But the main point,
then, is that the eigenvalues

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
of a symmetric matrix,
it just -- do you -- do --

327
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
where did we use symmetry,
by the way?

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We used it here,
right?

329
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Let -- can I just -- let --
suppose A was a complex.

330
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,700
Suppose A had been a complex
number.

331
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,000
Could -- could I have made all
this work?

332
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If A was a complex number --
complex matrix,

333
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
then here I should have written
A bar.

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I erased the bar because I
assumed A was real.

335
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But now let's suppose for a
moment it's not.

336
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then when I took this step,
what should I have?

337
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What did I do
on that step?

338
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I transposed.

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So I should have A bar
transpose.

340
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In the symmetric case,
that was A, and that's what

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
made everything work,
right?

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This -- this led immediately to
that.

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This one led immediately to
this when the matrix was real,

344
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
so that didn't matter,
and it was

345
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
symmetric, so that didn't
matter.

346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then I got A.

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But -- so now I just get to ask
you.

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Suppose the matrix had been
complex.

349
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,530
What's the right equivalent of
sym- symmetry?

350
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:50,000
So the good matrix -- so here,
let me say -- good matrixes --

351
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
by good I mean real
lambdas and perpendicular x-s.

352
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And tell me now,
which matrixes are good?

353
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If they're -- If they're real
matrixes, the good ones are

354
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
symmetric, because then
everything went through.

355
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The -- so the good -- I'm
saying now

356
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
what's good.

357
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This is -- this is -- these are
the good matrixes.

358
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
They have real eigenvalues,
perpendicular eigenvectors --

359
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
good means A equal A transpose
if real.

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Then -- then that was what --
our proof worked.

361
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But if A is complex,
all -- our proof will still

362
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
work
provided A bar transpose is A.

363
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you see what I'm saying?

364
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm saying if we have complex
matrixes and we want to say are

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
they -- are they as good as
symmetric matrixes,

366
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
then we should not only
transpose the thing,

367
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
but conjugate it.

368
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Those are good matrixes.

369
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And of course,
the most important s- the most

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
important case is when they're
real, this part doesn't matter

371
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and I just have A equal A
transpose symmetric.

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Do you -- I -- I'll just repeat
that.

373
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The good matrixes,
if complex, are these.

374
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If real, that doesn't make any
difference so I'm just saying

375
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
symmetric.

376
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And of course,
99% of examples and

377
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,500
applications to the matrixes are
real and we don't have that and

378
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,000
then symmetric is the key
property.

379
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

380
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So that -- that's,
these main facts and now

381
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
let me just -- let me just --
so that's this x bar transpose

382
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
x, okay.

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So I'll just,
write it once more in this

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
form.

385
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So perpendicular orthonormal
eigenvectors,

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
real eigenvalues,
transposes of orthonormal

387
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
eigenvectors.

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's the symmetric case,
A equal A transpose.

389
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

390
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Good.
Actually, I'll even take one
more step here.

391
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Suppose -- I -- I can break
this down to show you really

392
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
what that says about a symmetric
matrix.

393
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I can break that down.

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let me here -- here go these
eigenvectors.

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I -- here go these eigenvalues,
lambda one, lambda two and so

396
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,000
on.
Here go these eigenvectors
transposed.

397
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,540
And what happens if I actually
do out that multiplication?

398
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,000
Do you see what will happen?

399
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There's lambda one times q1
transpose.

400
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So the first row here is just
lambda one q1 transpose.

401
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
If I multiply column times row
-- you remember I could do that?

402
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
When I multiply matrixes,
I can multiply columns times

403
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
rows?

404
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So when I do that,
I get lambda one and then the

405
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
column
and then the row and then

406
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
lambda two and then the column
and the row.

407
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,950
Every symmetric matrix breaks
up into these pieces.

408
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,000
So these pieces have real
lambdas and they have these

409
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Eigen -- these orthonormal
eigenvectors.

410
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And, maybe you even could tell
me what kind of a matrix have I

411
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,400
got there?

412
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Suppose I take a unit vector
times its transpose?

413
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So column times row,
I'm getting a matrix.

414
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's a matrix with a special
name.

415
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What's it's -- what kind of a
matrix is it?

416
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We've seen those matrixes,
now, in chapter four.

417
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's -- is A A transpose with a
unit vector,

418
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
so I don't have to divide by A
transpose A.

419
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That matrix is a projection
matrix.

420
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That's a projection matrix.

421
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's symmetric and if I square
it there'll be another --

422
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,990
there'll be a q1 transpose q1,
which is one.

423
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,200
So I'll get that matrix back
again.

424
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:03,000
Every -- so every symmetric
matrix -- every symmetric matrix

425
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
is a combination of -- of
mutually perpendicular -- so

426
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
perpendicular projection
matrixes.

427
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Projection matrixes.

428
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay.
That's another way that people
like to think of the spectral

429
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
theorem, that every symmetric
matrix can be

430
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
broken up that way.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That -- I guess at this moment
-- first I haven't done an

432
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
example.

433
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I could create a symmetric
matrix, check that it's -- find

434
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
its eigenvalues,
they would come out real,

435
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
find its eigenvectors,
they would come out

436
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,920
perpendicular and you would see
it

437
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,000
in numbers, but maybe I'll
leave it here for the moment in

438
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
letters.

439
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, I -- maybe I will do it
with numbers,

440
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
for this reason.

441
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Because there's one more
remarkable fact.

442
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Can I just put this further
great fact about symmetric

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,900
matrixes on the board?

444
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,130
When I have symmetric matrixes,
I know their eigenvalues are

445
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,000
real.

446
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So then I can get interested in
the question are they positive

447
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
or negative?

448
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And you remember why that's
important.

449
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
For differential equations,
that decides between

450
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,400
instability and stability.

451
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,000
So I'm -- after I know they're
real, then the next question is

452
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
are they positive,
are they negative?

453
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And I hate to have to compute
those eigenvalues to answer that

454
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
question, right?

455
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Because computing the
eigenvalues of a symmetric

456
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
matrix of order let's say 50 --
compute its 50 eigenvalues -- is

457
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
a job.

458
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I mean, by pencil and paper
it's a lifetime's job.

459
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,460
I mean, which -- and in fact,
a few years ago -- well,

460
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,000
say, 20 years ago,
or 30, nobody really knew how

461
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
to do it.

462
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean, so, like,
science was stuck on this

463
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
problem.

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If you have a matrix of order
50 or

465
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
100, how do you find its
eigenvalues?

466
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Numerically,
now, I'm just saying,

467
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because pencil and paper is --
we're going to run out of time

468
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or paper or something before we
get it.

469
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Well -- and you might think,
okay, get

470
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,490
Matlab to compute the
determinant of lambda minus A,

471
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,000
A minus lambda I,
this polynomial of 50th degree,

472
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and then find the roots.

473
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Matlab will do it,
but it will complain,

474
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
because it's a very bad way to
find the eigenvalues.

475
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm sorry to be saying
this, because it's the way I

476
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
taught you to do it,
right?

477
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I taught you to find the
eigenvalues by doing that

478
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
determinant and taking the roots
of that polynomial.

479
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But now I'm saying,
okay, I really meant that for

480
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
two by twos and three by threes
but I didn't mean you to do it

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
on a 50 by
50 and you're not too unhappy,

482
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
probably, because you didn't
want to do it.

483
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But -- good,
because it would be a very

484
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
unstable way -- the 50 answers
that would come out would be

485
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,560
highly unreliable.

486
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,000
So, new ways are -- are much
better to find those 50

487
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
eigenvalues.

488
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's a -- that's a part of
numerical linear algebra.

489
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But here's the remarkable fact
-- that Matlab would quite

490
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
happily find the 50 pivots,
right?

491
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Now the pivots are not the same
as the eigenvalues.

492
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,500
But here's the great thing.

493
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,000
If I had a real matrix,
I could find those 50 pivots

494
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and I could see maybe 28 of them
are positive and 22 are negative

495
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,000
pivots.
And I can compute those safely
and quickly.

496
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And the great fact is that 28
of the eigenvalues would be

497
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
positive and 22 would be
negative --

498
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that the sines of the pivots --
so this is, like -- I hope you

499
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
think this -- this is kind of a
nice thing, that the sines of

500
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the pivots -- for symmetric,
I'm always talking about

501
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
symmetric matrixes -- so I'm
really,

502
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,000
like, trying to convince you
that symmetric matrixes are

503
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
better than the rest.

504
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So the sines of the pivots are
same as the sines of the

505
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
eigenvalues.

506
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The same number.

507
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The number of pivots greater
than zero, the number of

508
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
positive pivots is equal to the
number of positive eigenvalues.

509
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So that, actually,
is a very useful -- that gives

510
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you a g- a good start on a
decent way to compute

511
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
eigenvalues, because you can
narrow them down,

512
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you can find out how many are
positive, how many are negative.

513
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Then you could shift the matrix
by seven times the identity.

514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That would shift all the
eigenvalues by seven.

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Then you could take the pivots
of that matrix and you would

516
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
know how many eigenvalues of the
original were above seven and

517
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,000
below seven.
So this -- this neat little
theorem, that,

518
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
symmetric
matrixes have this connection

519
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
between the -- nobody's mixing
up and thinking the pivots are

520
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the eigenvalues -- I mean,
the only thing I can think of

521
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
is the product of the pivots
equals the product of the

522
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
eigenvalues, why is that?

523
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So if I asked you for the
reason on that,

524
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
why is the product
of the pivots for a symmetric

525
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
matrix the same as the product
of the eigenvalues?

526
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Because they both equal the
determinant.

527
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Right.

528
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The product of the pivots gives
the determinant if no row

529
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
exchanges, the product of the
eigenvalues always gives the

530
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
determinant.

531
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So -- so the products --
but that doesn't tell you

532
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
anything about the 50 individual
ones, which this does.

533
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Okay.
So that's -- those are
essential facts about symmetric

534
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
matrixes.

535
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Okay.

536
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Now I -- I said in the -- in
the lecture description that I

537
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
would take the last minutes
to start on positive definite

538
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
matrixes, because we're right
there, we're ready to say what's

539
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
a positive definite matrix?

540
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's symmetric,
first of all.

541
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
On -- always I will mean
symmetric.

542
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So this is the --
this is the next section of the

543
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
book.

544
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's about this -- if symmetric
matrixes are good,

545
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
which was, like,
the point of my lecture so far,

546
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
then positive,
definite matrixes are -- a

547
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
subclass that are excellent,
okay.

548
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Just the greatest.
so what are they?

549
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They're matrixes -- they're
symmetric matrixes,

550
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
so all their eigenvalues are
real.

551
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You can guess what they are.

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
These are symmetric matrixes
with all -- the eigenvalues are

553
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
-- okay, tell me what to write.

554
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What -- well,
it -- it's hinted,

555
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
of course, by the name for
these things.

556
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
All the eigenvalues are
positive.

557
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Okay.
Tell me about the pivots.

558
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We can check the eigenvalues or
we can check the pivots.

559
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
All the pivots are what?

560
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And then I'll -- then I'll
finally give an example.

561
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I feel awful that I have got to
this

562
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
point in the lecture and I
haven't given you a single

563
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,000
example.
So let me give you one.

564
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Five three two two.

565
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That's symmetric,
fine.

566
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's eigenvalues are real,
for sure.

567
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But more than that,
I know the sines of those

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
eigenvalues.

569
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And also I know the sines of
those

570
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
pivots, so what's the deal with
the pivots?

571
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The Ei- if the eigenvalues are
all positive and if this little

572
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
fact is true that the pivots and
eigenvalues have the same sines,

573
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
then this must be true -- all
the pivots are positive.

574
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And that's the good way to
test.

575
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This is the good test,
because I can -- what are the

576
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
pivots for that matrix?

577
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The pivots for that matrix are
five.

578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So pivots are five and what's
the second pivot?

579
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Have we, like,
noticed the formula for the

580
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,850
second pivot in a matrix?

581
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:24,550
It doesn't necessarily -- you
know, it may come out a fraction

582
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,000
for sure, but what is that
fraction?

583
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Can you tell me?

584
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Well, here, the product of the
pivots is the determinant.

585
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What's the determinant of this
matrix?

586
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Eleven?

587
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So the second pivot must be
eleven over five,

588
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
so that the product is eleven.

589
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
They're both positive.

590
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Then I know that the
eigenvalues of that matrix are

591
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
both positive.

592
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What are the eigenvalues?

593
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Well, I've got to take the
roots of -- you know,

594
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
do I put in a minus lambda?

595
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,800
You mentally do this -- lambda
squared minus how many lambdas?

596
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Eight?

597
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Right.
Five and three,
the trace comes in there,

598
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
plus what number comes here?

599
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The determinant,
the eleven, so I set that to

600
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
zero.
So the eigenvalues are -- let's
see, half of that is four,

601
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
look at that positive number,
plus or minus the square root

602
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
of
sixteen minus eleven,

603
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,460
I think five.

604
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,000
The eigenvalues -- well,
two by two they're not so

605
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
terrible, but they're not so
perfect.

606
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Pivots are really simple.

607
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And this is a -- this is the
family of matrixes that you

608
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
really want in differential
equations, because you know the

609
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
sines of the eigenvalues,
so you know the stability or

610
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
not.

611
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay.
There's one other related fact
I can pop in here in -- in the

612
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
time available for positive
definite matrixes.

613
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,300
The related fact is to ask you
about determinants.

614
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,000
So what's the determinant?

615
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What can you tell me if I --
remember, positive definite

616
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
means all eigenvalues are
positive, all pivots are

617
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
positive, so what can you tell
me about the determinant?

618
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's positive,
too.

619
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But somehow that -- that's not
quite enough.

620
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Here -- here's a matrix minus
one

621
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
minus three,
what's the determinant of that

622
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
guy?

623
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's positive,
right?

624
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Is this a positive,
definite matrix?

625
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Are the pivots -- what are the
pivots?

626
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well, negative.

627
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What are the eigenvalues?

628
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Well, they're also the same.

629
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So somehow I don't just want
the determinant of the whole

630
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
matrix.
Here is eleven,
that's great.

631
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Here the determinant of the
whole matrix is three,

632
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that's positive.

633
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I also -- I've got to check,
like, little sub-determinants,

634
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
say maybe coming down from the
left.

635
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,900
So the one by one and the two
by two

636
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,000
have to be positive.

637
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So there -- that's where I get
the all.

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
All -- can I call them
sub-determinants -- are -- see,

639
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,230
I have to -- I need to make the
thing plural.

640
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:54,130
I need to test n things,
not just the big determinant.

641
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,000
All sub-determinants are
positive.

642
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Then I'm okay.

643
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Then I'm okay.

644
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
This passes the test.

645
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Five is positive and eleven is
positive.

646
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
This fails the test because
that minus one there is

647
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
negative.

648
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And then the big determinant is
positive three.

649
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,670
So t- this --
these -- this fact -- you see

650
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,000
that actually the course,
like, coming together.

651
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And that's really my point now.

652
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
In the next -- in this lecture
and particularly next Wednesday

653
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and Friday, the course comes
together.

654
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
These pivots that we met in the
first week, these determinants

655
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that we met in the middle of
the course, these eigenvalues

656
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that we met most recently -- all
matrixes are square here,

657
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
so coming together for square
matrixes means these three

658
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
pieces come together and they
come together in that beautiful

659
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
fact, that if -- that all the --
that if I have one of these,

660
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I have the others.

661
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That if I -- but for symmetric
matrixes.

662
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So that -- this will be the
positive definite section and

663
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
then the real climax of the
course is to make everything

664
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
come together for n by n
matrixes,

665
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
not necessarily symmetric --
bring everything together there

666
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and that will be the final
thing.

667
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Okay.

668
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So have a great weekend and
don't forget symmetric matrixes.

669
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Thanks.
