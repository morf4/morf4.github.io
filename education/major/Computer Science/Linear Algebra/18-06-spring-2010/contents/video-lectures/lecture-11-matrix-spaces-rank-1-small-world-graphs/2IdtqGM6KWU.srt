1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.
This is linear algebra lecture
eleven.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And at the end of lecture ten,
I was talking about some vector

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
spaces, but they're -- the
things in those vector spaces

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
were not what we usually call
vectors.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,450
Nevertheless,
you could add them and you

6
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,000
could multiply by numbers,
so we can call them vectors.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,770
I think the example I was
working with they were matrices.

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,000
So the -- so we had like a
matrix space,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the space of all three by three
matrices.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I'd like to just pick up on
that, because --

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we've been so specific about n
dimensional space here,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and you really want to see that
the same ideas work as long as

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you can add and multiply by
scalars.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So these new,
new vector spaces,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
the example I took was the
space M of all three by three

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
matrices.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
OK.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can add them,
I can multiply by scalars.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can multiply two of them
together, but I don't do that.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's not part of the vector
space picture.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The vector space part is just
adding the matrices and

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,180
multiplying by numbers.

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,000
And that's fine,
we stay within this space of

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
three by three matrices.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,740
And I had some subspaces that
were interesting,

26
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,000
like the symmetric,
the subspace of symmetric

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
matrices, symmetric three by
threes.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Or the subspace of upper
triangular three by threes.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Now I, I use the word subspace
because it follows the rule.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
If I add two symmetric
matrices, I'm still symmetric.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If I multiply two symmetric
matrices, is the product

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
automatically symmetric?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I'm not multiplying
matrices.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,860
I'm just adding.

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,000
So I'm fine.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a subspace.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Similarly, if I add two upper
triangular matrices,

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm still upper triangular.

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,000
And, that's a subspace.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now I just want to take these
as example and ask,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
well, what's a basis for that
subspace?

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's the dimension of that
subspace?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And what's bd- dimension of the
whole space?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, there's a natural basis for
all three by three matrices,

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and why don't we just write it
down.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, so M, a basis for M.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Again, all three by threes.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OK.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,400
And then I'll just count how
many members are in that basis

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
and I'll know the dimension.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And OK, it's going to take me a
little time.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,610
In fact, what is the dimension?

54
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,000
Any idea of what I'm coming up
with next?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How many numbers does it take
to specify that three by three

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
matrix?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Nine.
Nine is the,
is the dimension I'm going to

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
find.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the most obvious basis
would be the matrix that's that

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
matrix and then this matrix with
a one there and that's two of

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
them, shall I put in the third
one, and then onwards,

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the last one maybe would
end with the one.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OK.
That's like the standard basis.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,190
In fact, our space is
practically the same as nine

65
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,000
dimensional space.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just the nine numbers are
written in a square instead of

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in a column.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But somehow it's different and,
and ought to be thought of as

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
-- natural for itself.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because now what about the
symmetric three by threes?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So that's a subspace.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just let's just think,
what's the dimension of that

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
subspace and what's a basis for
that subspace.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OK.
And I guess this question
occurs to me.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If I look at this subspace of
symmetric three by threes,

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,480
well, how many of these
original basis members belong to

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,000
the subspace?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think only three of them do.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This one is symmetric.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,350
This last one is symmetric.

81
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,000
And the one in the middle with
a, with a one in that position

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
--
in the two two position,

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,659
would be symmetric.

84
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,000
But so I've got three of these
original nine are symmetric,

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
but, so this is an example
where -- but that's,

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that's not all,
right?

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's the dimension?

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's put the dimensions down.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Dimension of the,
of M, was nine.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,090
What's the dimension of --
shall we call this S -- is what?

91
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,000
What's the dimension of this?

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sort of taking simple
examples where we can,

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
we can, spot the answer to
these questions.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So how many -- if I have a
symmetric --

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
think of all symmetric matrices
as a subspace,

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
how many parameters do I choose
in three by three symmetric

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
matrices?

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Six, right.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If I choose the diagonal that's
three, and the three entries

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
above the diagonal,
then I know what the three

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
entries below.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So the dimension is six.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I guess what's the dimension of
this here?

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's call this space U for
upper triangular.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So what's the dimension of that
space of all upper triangular

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
three by threes?

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Again six.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Again six.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And, but we haven't got a -- we
haven't seen -- well,

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
actually, maybe we have got a
basis here for,

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the upper triangulars.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I guess six of these guys,
one, two, three,

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
four, and a,
and a couple more,

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,570
would be upper triangular.

115
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,000
So there's a accidental case
where the big basis contains in

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
it a basis for the subspace.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,720
But with the symmetric guy,
it didn't have.

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
The symmetric guy the,
basis -- so you see -- a basis

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,870
is the basis for the big space,
we generally need to think it

120
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,000
all over again to get a basis
for the subspace.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then how do I get other
subspaces?

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, we spoke before about,
the subspace the symmetric

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,290
matrices and the upper
triangular.

124
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:28,200
This is symmetric and upper
triangular.

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,000
OK.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's the, what's the
dimension of that space?

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, what's in that space?

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So what's -- if a matrix is
symmetric and also upper

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
triangular, that makes it
diagonal.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,820
So this is the same as the
diagonal matrices,

131
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,000
diagonal three by threes.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And the dimension of this,
of S intersect U,

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
right -- you're OK with that
symbol?

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's, that's the vectors that
are in both S and U,

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
and that's D.

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,930
So S intersect U is the
diagonals.

137
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,000
And the dimension of the
diagonal matrices is three.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And we've got a basis,
no problem.

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
OK, as I write that,
I think, OK,

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
what about putting -- so this
is like, this intersection --

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is taking all the vectors that
are in both, that are symmetric

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and also upper triangular.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now we looked at the union.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Suppose I take the matrices
that are symmetric or upper

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
triangular.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What -- why was that no good?

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So why is it no -- why I not
interested in the union,

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,080
putting together those two
subspaces?

149
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,000
So this, these are matrices
that are in S or in U,

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
or possibly both,
so they, the diagonals

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
included.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But what's bad about this?

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not a subspace.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's like having,
taking, you know,

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a couple of lines in the plane
and stopping there.

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A line -- this is -- so there's
a three dimensional subspace of

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
a nine dimensional space,
there's -- ooh,

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
sorry, six.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There's a six dimensional
subspace of a nine dimensional

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,510
space.

161
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,790
There's another one.

162
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,000
But they, they're headed in
different directions,

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so we, we can't just put them
together.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We have to fill in.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So that's what we do.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,570
To get this bigger space that
I'll write with a plus sign,

167
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,000
this is combinations of things
in S and things in U.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
OK.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So that's the final space I'm
going to introduce.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have a couple of subspaces.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can take their intersection.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And now I'm interested in not
their union but their sum.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So this would be the,
this is the intersection,

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and this will be their sum.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So what do I need for a
subspace here?

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I take anything in S plus
anything in U.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't just take things that
are in S and pop in also,

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
separately, things that are in
U.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is the sum of any element
of S, that is,

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
any symmetric matrix,
plus any in U,

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
any element of U.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
OK.
Now as long as we've got an
example here,

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
tell me what we get.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If I take every symmetric
matrix, take all symmetric

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,420
matrices, and add them to all
upper triangular matrices,

186
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,000
then I've got a whole lot of
matrices and it is a subspace.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And what's -- it's a vector
space,

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and what vector space would I
then have?

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Any idea what,
what matrices can I get out of

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
a symmetric plus an upper
triangular?

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can get anything.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I get all matrices.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,220
I get all three by threes.

194
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,000
It's worth thinking about that.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's just like stretch your
mind a little,

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
just a little,
to, to think of these subspaces

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and what their intersection is
and what their sum is.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And now can I give you a little
-- oh, well, let's figure out

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the dimension.

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So what's the dimension of S
plus U?

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
In this example is nine,
because we got all three by

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
threes.

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So the original spaces had,
the original symmetric space

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
had dimension six and the
original upper triangular space

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
had dimension six.

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And actually I'm seeing here a
nice formula.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That the dimension of S plus
the dimension of U -- if I have

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
two subspaces,
the dimension of one plus the

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
dimension of the other --
equals the dimension of their

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
intersection plus the dimension
of their sum.

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Six plus six is three plus
nine.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's kind of satisfying,
that these natural operations

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
-- and we've -- this is it,
actually, this is the set of

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
natural things to do with,
with subspaces.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That, the dimensions come out
in a good way.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,000
OK.
Maybe I'll take just one more
example of a vector space that

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
doesn't have vectors in it.

218
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's come from differential
equations.

219
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So this is a one more new
vector space that we'll give

220
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,490
just a few minutes to.

221
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,000
Suppose I have a differential
equation like d^2y/dx^2+ y=0.

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
OK.

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I look at the solutions to that
equation.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So what are the solutions to
that equation?

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
y=cos(x) is a solution.
y=sin(x) is a solution.

226
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
y equals -- well,
e to the (ix) is a solution,

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
if you want,
if you allow me to put that in.

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But why should I put that in?

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's already there.

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You see, I'm really looking at
a null space here.

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm looking at the null space
of a differential equation.

232
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's the solution space.

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And describe the solution
space, all solutions to this

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
differential equation.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So the equation is y''+y=0.

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Cosine's, cosine's a solution,
sine is a solution.

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Now tell me all the solutions.

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They're -- so I don't need
e^(ix).

239
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Forget that.

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What are all the complete
solutions?

241
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is what?

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,410
A combination of these.

243
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,000
The complete solution is y
equals some multiple of the

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
cosine plus some multiple of the
sine.

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's a vector space.

246
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's a vector space.

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's the dimension of that
space?

248
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
What's a basis for that space?

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
OK, let me ask you a basis
first.

250
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If I take the set of solutions
to that second order

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
differential equation --
there it is,

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
those are the solutions.

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What's a basis for that space?

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now remember,
what's the, what question I

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000
asking?
Because if you know the
question I'm asking,

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
you'll see the answer.

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
A basis means all the guys in
the space are combinations of

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
these basis vectors.

259
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Well, this is a basis.
sin x, cos x there is a basis.

260
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,560
Those two -- they're like the
special solutions,

261
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,000
right?

262
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We had special solutions to
Ax=b.

263
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Now we've got special solutions
to differential equations.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sorry, we had special solutions
to Ax=0, I misspoke.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The special solutions were for
the null space just as here

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we're talking about the null
space.

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Do you see that here is a --
those two -- and what's the

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,980
dimension of the solution space?

269
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,000
How many vectors in this basis?

270
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Two, the sine and cosine.

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Are those the only basis for
this space?

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
By no means.
e^(ix) and e^(-ix) would be

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
another basis.

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Lots of bases.

275
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But do you see that really what
a course in differential --

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
in linear differential
equations is about is finding a

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
basis for the solution space.

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The dimension of the solution
space will always be -- will be

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
two, because we have a second
order equation.

280
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So that's, like there's 18.03
in --

281
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,200
five minutes of 18.06 is enough
to, to take care of 18.03.

282
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,000
OK.

283
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,510
So there's a -- that's one more
example.

284
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,000
And of course the point of the
example is these things don't

285
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
look like vectors.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They look like functions.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But we can call them vectors,
because we can add them and we

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
can multiply by constants,
so we can take linear

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
combinations.

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's all we have to be
allowed to do.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,920
So that's really why this idea
of linear algebra and basis and

292
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,000
dimension and so on plays a
wider role than --

293
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
our constant discussions of m
by n matrices.

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
OK.

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's what I wanted to say
about that topic.

296
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Now of course the key,
number associated with

297
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
matrices, to go back to that
number, is the rank.

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And the rank,
what do we know about the rank?

299
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, we know it's not bigger
than m and it's not bigger than

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,380
n.

301
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,000
So but I'd like to have a
little discussion on the rank.

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Maybe I'll put that here.

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So I'm picking up this topic of
rank one matrices.

304
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,920
And the reason I'm interested
in rank one matrices is that

305
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,000
they ought to be simple.

306
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If the rank is only one,
the matrix can't get away from

307
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,000
us.
So for example,
let me take -- let me create a

308
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
rank one matrix.

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,000
OK.
Suppose it's three -- suppose
it's two by three.

310
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,000
And let me give you the first
row.

311
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What can the second row be?

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Tell me a possible second row
here, for, for this matrix to

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
have rank one.

314
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,140
A possible second row is?

315
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,000
Two eight ten.

316
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The second row is a multiple of
the first row.

317
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's not independent.

318
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So tell me a basis for the --
oh yeah, sorry to keep bringing

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
up these same questions.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
After the quiz I'll stop,
but for now,

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
tell me a basis for the row
space.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
A basis for the row space of
that matrix is the first row,

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
right?
The first row,
one four five.

324
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,000
A basis for the column space of
this matrix is?

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's the dimension of the
column space?

326
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The dimension of the column
space is also one,

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,000
right?
Because it's also the rank.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The dimension -- you remember
the dimension of the column

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
space equals the rank equals the
dimension of the column space of

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the transpose,
which is the row space of A.

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
OK, and in this case it's one,
r is one.

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And sure enough,
all the columns are -- all the

333
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
other columns are multiples of
that column.

334
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,410
Now there's -- there ought to
be a nice way to see that,

335
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,000
and here it is.

336
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can write that matrix as its
pivot column,

337
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,950
one two, times its -- times one
four five.

338
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,000
A column times a row,
one column times one row gives

339
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
me a matrix, right?

340
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If I multiply a column by a
row, that, g- that's a two by

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
one matrix times a one by three
matrix, and the result of the

342
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
multiplication is two by three.

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And it comes out right.

344
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So what I want to -- my point
is the rank one matrices that

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
every rank one matrix has the
form some column times some row.

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So U is a column vector,
V is a column vector --

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but I make it into a row by
putting in V transpose.

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So that's the -- complete
picture of rank one matrices.

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We'll be interested in rank one
matrices.

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Later we'll find,
oh, their determinant,

351
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,310
that'll be easy,
their eigenvalues,

352
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,000
that'll be interesting.

353
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Rank one matrices are like the
building blocks for all

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
matrices.

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And actually maybe you can
guess.

356
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
If I took any matrix,
a five by seventeen matrix of

357
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,500
rank four, then it seems pretty
likely --

358
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,000
and it's true,
that I could break that five by

359
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
seventeen matrix down as a
combination of rank one

360
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
matrices.

361
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,310
And probably how many of those
would I need?

362
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,000
If I have a five by seventeen
matrix of rank four,

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll need four of them,
right.

364
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Four rank one matrices.

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So the rank one matrices are
the, are the building blocks.

366
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And out -- I can produce every,
I can produce every five by --

367
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,400
every rank four matrix out of
four rank one matrices.

368
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,000
OK.

369
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That brings me to a question,
of course.

370
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Would the rank four matrices
form a subspace?

371
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let me take all five by
seventeen matrices and think

372
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
about rank four -- the subset of
rank four matrices.

373
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Let me -- I'll write this down.

374
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,230
You seem I'm reviewing for the
quiz, because I'm asking the

375
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,000
kind of questions that are short
enough but --

376
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
that bring out do you know what
these words mean.

377
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So I take -- my matrix space M
now is all five by seventeen

378
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
matrices.

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,240
And now the question I ask is
the subset of,

380
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,000
of rank four matrices,
is that a subspace?

381
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If I add a matrix of --
so if I multiply a matrix of

382
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
rank four by -- of rank four or
less, let's say,

383
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,480
because I have to let the zero
matrix in if it's going to be a

384
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,260
subspace.

385
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,000
But, but that doesn't just
because the zero matrix got in

386
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,230
there doesn't mean I have a
subspace.

387
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,000
So if I -- so the,
the question really comes down

388
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to --
if I add two rank four

389
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
matrices, is the sum rank four?

390
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What do you think?

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If -- no, not usually.

392
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Not usually.

393
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If I add two rank four
matrices, the sum is probably --

394
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
what could I say about the sum?

395
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, actually,
well, the rank could be five.

396
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's a general fact,
actually, that the rank of A

397
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
plus B can't be more than rank
of A plus the rank of B.

398
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,820
So this would say if I added
two of those,

399
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,000
the rank couldn't be larger
than eight, but I know actually

400
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the rank couldn't be as large as
eight anyway.

401
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
What -- how big could the rank
be, for, for the rank of a

402
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
matrix in M?

403
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,000
Could be as large as five,
right, right.

404
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So they're all sort of natural
ideas.

405
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it's rank four matrices or
rank one matrices -- let me,

406
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
let me change that to rank one.

407
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,170
Let me take the subset of rank
one matrices.

408
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,000
Is that a vector space?

409
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If I add a rank one matrix to a
rank one matrix?

410
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No.

411
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's most likely going to have
rank two.

412
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So this is -- So I'll just make
that point.

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Not a subspace.

414
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
OK.
OK.
Those are topics that I wanted
to, just fill out the,

415
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the previous lectures.

416
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The I'll ask one more subspace
question, a, a more,

417
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
a more, likely example.

418
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Suppose I'm in -- let me put,
put this example on a new

419
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
board.

420
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Suppose I'm in R,
in R^4.

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So my typical vector in R^4 has
four components,

422
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
v1, v2, v3, and v4.

423
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Suppose I take the subspace of
vectors whose components add to

424
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
zero.

425
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So I let S be all v,
all vectors v in four

426
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
dimensional space with
v1+v2+v3+v4=0.

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I just want to consider that
bunch of vectors.

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Is it a subspace,
first of all?

429
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,230
It is a subspace.

430
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,000
It is a subspace.

431
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What's -- how do we see that?

432
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It is a subspace.

433
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I -- formally I should check.

434
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If I have one vector that with
whose components add to zero and

435
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I multiply that vector by six --
the components still add to

436
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
zero, just six times as -- six
times zero.

437
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
If I have a couple of v and a w
and I add them,

438
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
the, the components still add
to zero.

439
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
OK, it's a subspace.

440
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What's the dimension of that
space and what's a basis for

441
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that space?

442
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So you see how I can just
describe a space and we --

443
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
we can ask for the dimension --
ask for the basis first and the

444
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
dimension.

445
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Of course, the dimension's the
one that's easy to tell me in a

446
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
single word.

447
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
What's the dimension of our
subspace S here?

448
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And a basis tell me -- some
vectors in it.

449
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, I'm going to make ask you
again to guess the dimension.

450
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,110
Again I think I heard it.

451
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,000
Three.

452
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The dimension is three.

453
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,180
Now how does this connect to
our Ax=0?

454
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,000
Is this the null space of
something?

455
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Is that the null space of a
matrix?

456
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And then we can look at the
matrix and, and we know

457
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
everything about those
subspaces.

458
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is the null space of what
matrix?

459
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What's the matrix where the
null space is then Ab=0.

460
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,940
So I want this equation to be
Ab=0.

461
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,000
b is now the vector.

462
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And what's the matrix that,
that we're seeing there?

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's the matrix of four ones.

464
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Do you see that that's -- that
if I look at Ab=0 for this

465
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
matrix A, I multiply by b and I
get this requirement,

466
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that the components add to
zero.

467
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I'm really when I speak
about S --

468
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm speaking about the null
space of that matrix.

469
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
OK.

470
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Let's just say we've got a
matrix now, we want its null

471
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
space.

472
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, we -- tell me its rank
first.

473
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The rank of that matrix is one,
thanks.

474
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,500
So r is one.

475
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:09,000
What's the general formula for
the dimension of the null space?

476
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The dimension of the null space
of a matrix is -- in general,

477
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
an m by n matrix of rank r?

478
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
How many independent guys in
the null space?

479
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
n-r, right?
n-r.

480
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
In this case,
n is four, four columns.

481
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The rank is one,
so the null space is three

482
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
dimensions.

483
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So of course y- you could see
it in this case,

484
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but you can also see it here in
our systematic way of dealing

485
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
with the four fundamental
subspaces of a matrix.

486
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So what actually what,
what are all four subspaces

487
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
then?
The row space is clear.

488
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,000
The row space is in R^4.

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, can we take the four
fundamental subspaces of this

490
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
matrix?

491
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Let's just kill this example.

492
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The row space is one
dimensional.

493
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's all multiples of that,
of that row.

494
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The null space is three
dimensional.

495
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Oh, you better give me a basis
for the null space.

496
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,050
So what's a basis for the null
space?

497
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,000
The special solutions.

498
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
To find the special solutions,
I look for the free variables.

499
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The free variables here are --
there's the pivot.

500
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The free variables are two,
three, and four.

501
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So the basis,
basis for S,

502
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
for S will be -- I'm expecting
three vectors,

503
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
three special solutions.

504
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I give the value one to that
free variable,

505
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and what's the pivot variable
if the --

506
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
this is going to be a vector in
S?

507
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Minus one.

508
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Now they're always added to --
the entries add to zero.

509
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
The second special solution has
a one in the second free

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
variable, and again a minus one
makes it right.

511
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The third one has a one in the
third free variable,

512
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and again a minus one makes it
right.

513
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's my answer.

514
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,110
That's the answer I would be
looking for.

515
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,750
The -- a basis for this
subspace S, you would just list

516
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,000
three vectors,
and those would be the natural

517
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
three to list.

518
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Not the only possible three,
but those are the special

519
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,750
three.

520
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:04,000
OK, tell me about the column
space, What's the column space

521
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
of this matrix A?

522
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So the column space is a
subspace of R^1,

523
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
because m is only one.

524
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The columns only have one
component.

525
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So the column space of S,
the column space of A is

526
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
somewhere in the space R^1,
because we only have --

527
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
these columns are short.

528
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And what is the column space
actually?

529
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I just, it's just talking with
these words is what I'm doing.

530
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The column space for that
matrix is R^1.

531
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The column space for that
matrix is all multiples of that

532
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
column.

533
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And all multiples give you all
of R^1.

534
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And what's the,
the remaining fourth space,

535
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
the null space of A transpose
is what?

536
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So we transpose A.

537
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We look for combinations of the
columns now that give zero for A

538
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
transpose.

539
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And there aren't any.

540
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,680
The only thing,
the only combination of these

541
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,000
rows to give the zero row is the
zero combination.

542
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,000
OK.
So let's just check dimensions.

543
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The null space has dimension
three.

544
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,160
The row space has dimension
one.

545
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,000
Three plus one is four.

546
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The column space has dimension
one, and what's the dimension of

547
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,270
this, like, smallest possible
space?

548
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,000
What's the dimension of the
zero space?

549
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's a subspace.

550
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Zero.

551
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What else could it be?

552
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I mean, let's -- we have to
take a reasonable answer --

553
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and the only reasonable answer
is zero.

554
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So one plus zero gives -- this
was n, the number of columns,

555
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and this is m,
the number of rows.

556
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And let's just,
let me just say again then the,

557
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the, the subspace that has only
that one point,

558
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that point is zero dimensional,
of course.

559
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And the basis is empty,
because if the dimension is

560
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
zero, there shouldn't be anybody
in the basis.

561
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So the basis of that smallest
subspace is the empty set.

562
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And the number of members in
the empty set is zero,

563
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so that's the dimension.

564
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
OK.
Good.

565
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Now I have just five minutes to
tell you about -- well,

566
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
actually, about some,
some, some, this is now,

567
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
this last topic of small world
graphs, and leads into,

568
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
a lecture about graphs and
linear algebra.

569
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But let me tell you -- in these
last minutes the graph that I

570
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
interested in.

571
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's the graph where -- so what
is a graph?

572
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Better tell you that first.

573
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
OK.

574
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What's a graph?

575
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
OK.

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This isn't calculus.

577
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,170
We're not, I'm not thinking of,
like, some sine curve.

578
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:05,000
The word graph is used in a
completely different way.

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's a set of,
a bunch of nodes and edges,

580
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
edges connecting the nodes.

581
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I have nodes like five nodes
and edges -- I'll put in some

582
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
edges, I could put,
include them all.

583
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There's -- well,
let me put in a couple more.

584
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
There's a graph with five nodes
and one two three four five six

585
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
edges.

586
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And some five by six matrix is
going to tell us everything

587
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
about that graph.

588
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Let me leave that matrix to
next time and tell you about the

589
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
question I'm interested in.

590
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Suppose, suppose the graph
isn't just, just doesn't have

591
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
just five nodes,
but suppose every,

592
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
suppose every person in this
room is a node.

593
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And suppose there's an edge
between two nodes if those two

594
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
people are friends.

595
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So have I described a graph?

596
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's a pretty big graph,
hundred, hundred nodes.

597
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,050
And I don't know how many edges
are in there.

598
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,000
There's an edge if you're
friends.

599
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So that's the graph for this
class.

600
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
A, a similar graph you could
take for the whole country,

601
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
so two hundred and sixty
million nodes.

602
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,030
And edges between friends.

603
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:52,000
And the question for that graph
is how many steps does it take

604
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
to get from anybody to anybody?

605
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
What two people are furthest
apart in this friendship graph,

606
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
say for the US?

607
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
By furthest apart,
I mean the distance from --

608
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
well, I'll tell you my distance
to Clinton.

609
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's two.

610
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I happened to go to college
with somebody who knows Clinton.

611
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't know him.

612
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So my distance to Clinton is
not one, because I don't,

613
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
happily or not,
don't know him.

614
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But I know somebody who does.

615
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
He's a Senator and so I presume
he knows him.

616
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OK.

617
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't know what your -- well,
what's your distance to

618
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Clinton?

619
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, not more than three,
right.

620
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Actually, true.

621
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You know me.

622
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I take credit for reducing your
Clinton distance to three --

623
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
what's your distance to Monica.

624
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,990
Not, anybody below -- below
four is in trouble here.

625
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,000
Or maybe three,
but, right.

626
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So -- and what's Hillary's
distance to Monica?

627
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't think we'd better put
that on tape here.

628
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's one or two,
I guess.

629
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Is that right?

630
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,790
I don't -- well,
we won't, think more about

631
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:32,000
that.

632
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So actually,
the, the real question is what

633
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,860
are large distances?

634
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,000
How, how far apart could people
be separated?

635
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,300
And roughly this number six
degrees of separation has kind

636
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,880
of appeared as the movie title,
as the book title,

637
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,000
and it's with this meaning.

638
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That roughly speaking --
six might be a fairly -- not

639
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
too many people.

640
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
If you sit next to somebody on
an airplane, you get talking to

641
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,930
them.

642
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,000
You begin to discuss mutual
friends to sort of find out,

643
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
OK, what connections do you
have, and very often you'll find

644
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
you're connected in,
like, two or three or four

645
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
steps.

646
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And you remark,
it's a small world,

647
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and that's how this expression
small world came up.

648
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,500
But six, I don't know if you
could find -- if it took six,

649
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't know if you would
successfully discover those six

650
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
in a, in an airplane
conversation.

651
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But here's the math question,
and I'll leave it for next,

652
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
for lecture twelve,
and do a lot of linear algebra

653
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
in lecture twelve.

654
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,350
But the interesting point is
that with a few shortcuts,

655
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:00,000
the distances come down
dramatically.

656
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That, I mean,
all your distances to Clinton

657
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
immediately drop to three by
taking linear algebra.

658
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That's, like,
an extra bonus for taking

659
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
linear algebra.

660
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And to understand
mathematically what it is about

661
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
these graphs --
or like the graphs of the World

662
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Wide Web.

663
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's a fantastic graph.

664
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So many people would like to
understand and model the web.

665
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What the -- where the edges are
links and the nodes are,

666
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
sites, websites.

667
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'll leave you with that graph,
and I'll see you --

668
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
have a good weekend,
and see you on Monday.
