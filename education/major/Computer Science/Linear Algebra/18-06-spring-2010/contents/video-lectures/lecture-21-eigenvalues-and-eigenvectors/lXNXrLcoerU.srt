1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,890
OK.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,000
So this is the first lecture on
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and that's a big subject that
will take up most of the rest of

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the course.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's, again,
matrices are square and we're

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
looking now for some special
numbers,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the eigenvalues,
and some special vectors,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the eigenvectors.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And so this lecture is mostly
about what are these numbers,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then the other lectures are
about how do we use them,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
why do we want them.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OK, so what's an eigenvector?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Maybe I'll start with
eigenvector.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's an eigenvector?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So I have a matrix A.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
OK.
What does a matrix do?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It acts on vectors.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It multiplies vectors x.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the way that matrix acts is
in goes a vector x and out comes

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
a vector Ax.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,000
It's like a function.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
With a function in calculus,
in goes a number x,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
out comes f(x).

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Here in linear algebra we're up
in more dimensions.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In goes a vector x,
out comes a vector Ax.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And the vectors I'm specially
interested in are the ones the

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,270
come out in the same direction
that they went in.

28
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,210
That won't be typical.

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,000
Most vectors,
Ax is in -- points in

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
some different direction.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But there are certain vectors
where Ax comes out parallel to

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
x.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And those are the eigenvectors.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So Ax parallel to x.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Those are the eigenvectors.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And what do I mean by parallel?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, much easier to just state
it in an equation.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ax is some multiple -- and
everybody calls that multiple

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
lambda -- of x.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's our big equation.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We look for special vectors --
and remember most vectors won't

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,010
be eigenvectors -- that -- for
which Ax is in the same

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,079
direction as x,
and by same direction I allow

44
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,000
it to
be the very opposite direction,

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I allow lambda to be negative
or zero.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I guess we've met the
eigenvectors that have

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,020
eigenvalue zero.

48
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,000
Those are in the same
direction, but they're -- in a

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
kind of very special way.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So this --
the eigenvector x.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Lambda, whatever this
multiplying factor is,

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
whether it's six or minus six
or zero or even some imaginary

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
number, that's the eigenvalue.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So there's the eigenvalue,
there's the eigenvector.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's just take a second on
eigenvalue zero.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
From the point of view of
eigenvalues, that's no special

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
deal.
That's, we have an eigenvector.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If the eigenvalue happened to
be zero, that would mean that Ax

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
was zero x, in other words zero.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what would x,
where would we look for -- what

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
are the x-s?

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What are the eigenvectors with
eigenvalue zero?

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're the guys in the null
space, Ax equals zero.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So if our matrix is singular,
let me write this down.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If, if A is singular,
then that -- what does singular

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
mean?

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It means that it takes some
vector x into zero.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Some non-zero vector,
that's why -- will be the

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
eigenvector into zero.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Then lambda equals zero is an
eigenvalue.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But we're interested in all
eigenvalues now,

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
lambda equals zero is not,
like, so special anymore.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
OK.
So the question is,
how do we find these x-s and

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
lambdas?

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And notice -- we don't have
an equation Ax equal B anymore.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't use elimination.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've got two unknowns,
and in fact they're multiplied

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
together.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Lambda and x are both unknowns
here.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, we need to,
we need a good idea of how to

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,180
find them.

82
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,000
But before I,
before I

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
do that, and that's where
determinant will come in,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
can I just give you some
matrices?

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like here you go.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Take the matrix,
a projection matrix.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OK.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So suppose we have a plane and
our matrix P is -- what I've

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,440
called A, now I'm going to call
it P for the

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,000
moment, because it's -- I'm
thinking OK, let's look at a

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
projection matrix.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are the eigenvalues of a
projection matrix?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So that's my question.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are the x-s,
the eigenvectors,

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and the lambdas,
the eigenvalues,

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
for -- and now let me say a
projection matrix.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
My,
my point is that we -- before

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
we get into determinants and,
and formulas and all that

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
stuff, let's take some matrices
where we know what they do.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,159
We know that if we take a
vector b, what this matrix does

101
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,000
is it projects it down to Pb.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So is b an eigenvector in,
in that picture?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that vector b an
eigenvector?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Not so, so b is not an
eigenvector c- because Pb,

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
its projection,
is in a different direction.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So now tell me what vectors are
eigenvectors of P?

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What vectors do get projected
in the same direction that they

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
start?
So, so answer,
tell me some x-s.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
In this picture,
where could I start with a

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
vector b or x,
do its projection,

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and end up in the same
direction?

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, that would happen if the
vector was right in that plane

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
already.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If the vector x was -- so let
the vector x -- so any vector,

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
any x in the plane will be an
eigenvector.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And what will happen when I
multiply by P,

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
when I project a vector x -- I
called it b here,

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because this is our familiar
picture, but now I'm going to

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
say that b was no good for,
for the, for our purposes.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm interested in a vector x
that's actually in the plane,

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and I project it,
and what do I get back?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
x, of course.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,390
Doesn't move.

125
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,000
So any x in the plane is
unchanged by P,

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and what's that telling me?

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's telling me that x is an
eigenvector,

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and it's also telling me what's
the eigenvalue,

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,940
which is -- just compare it
with that.

130
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,000
The eigenvalue,
the multiplier,

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,850
is just one.

132
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,000
Good.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So we have actually a whole
plane of eigenvectors.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now I ask, are there any other
eigenvectors?

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I expect the answer to be
yes, because I would like to get

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
three, if I'm in three
dimensions, I would like to hope

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
for three independent
eigenvectors,

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
two of them in the plane and
one not in the plane.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
OK.
So this guy b that I drew there
was

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,350
not any good.

141
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,710
What's the right eigenvector
that's not in the plane?

142
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,000
The, the good one is the one
that's perpendicular to the

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
plane.
There's an, another good x,
because what's the projection?

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So these are eigenvectors.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Another guy here would be
another eigenvector.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But now here is another one.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Any x that's perpendicular to
the plane, what's Px for that,

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
for that, vector?

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What's the projection of this
guy

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
perpendicular to the plane?

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It is zero, of course.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So -- there's the null space.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Px and n- for those guys are
zero, or zero x if we like,

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and the eigenvalue is zero.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So my answer to the question
is, what are the eigenvalues for

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
a
projection matrix?

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There they are.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
One and zero.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
OK.
We know projection matrices.

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We can write them down as that
A, A transpose,

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A inverse, A transpose thing,
but without doing that

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
from the picture we could see
what are the eigenvectors.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,260
OK.

164
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,000
Are there other matrices?

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let me take a second example.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How about a permutation matrix?

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What about the matrix,
I'll call it A now.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Zero one, one zero.
A equals zero one one zero,
that had eigenvalue one and

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Can you tell me a vector x --
see, we'll have a system soon

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
enough, so I,
I would like to just do these

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
e- these couple of examples,
just to see the picture before

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we, before we let it all,
go into a system where

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that, matrix isn't anything
special.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because it is special.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And what, so what vector could
I multiply by and end up in the

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
same direction?

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can you spot an eigenvector for
this guy?

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,500
That's a matrix that permutes
x1 and x2,

179
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,000
right?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It switches the two components
of x.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How could the vector with its
x2 x1, with -- permuted turn out

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
to be a multiple of x1 x2,
the vector we start with?

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,180
Can you tell me an eigenvector
here for this guy?

184
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:58,000
x equal -- what is -- actually,
can you tell me one vector that

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
has eigenvalue one?

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So what, what vector would have
eigenvalue one,

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
so that if I,
if I permute it it doesn't

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,150
change?
right?

189
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,000
There, that could be one one,
thanks.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
One one.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
OK, take that vector one one.

192
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That will be an eigenvector,
because if I do Ax I get one

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
one.

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So that's the eigenvalue is
one.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Great.
That's one eigenvalue.

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I have here a two by two
matrix, and I figure there's

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
going to be a second eigenvalue.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And eigenvector.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now, what about that?

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What's a vector,
OK, maybe we can just,

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
like, guess it.

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A vector that the other --
actually, this one that I'm

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
thinking of is going to be a
vector that has eigenvalue minus

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
one.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's going to be my other
eigenvalue for this matrix.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a -- notice the nice
positive or not negative matrix,

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but an eigenvalue is going to
come out negative.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And can you guess,
spot the x that will work for

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
that?

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So I want a,
a vector.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When I multiply by A,
which reverses the two

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
components, I want the thing to
come out minus the original.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So what shall I send in in that
case?

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If I send in negative one one.

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then when I apply A,
I get I do that multiplication,

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and I get one negative one,
so it reversed sign.

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So Ax is -x.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Lambda is minus one.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ax -- so Ax was x there and Ax
is minus x here.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Can I just mention,
like, jump ahead,

221
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and point out a special little
fact about eigenvalues.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
n by n matrices will have n
eigenvalues.

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And it's not like -- suppose n
is three or four or more.

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's not so easy to find them.

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We'd have a third degree or a
fourth degree or an n-th degree

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
equation.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But here's one nice fact.

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
There, there's one pleasant
fact.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That the sum of the eigenvalues
equals the sum down the

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
diagonal.

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's called the trace,
and I put that in the lecture

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
content specifically.

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So this is a neat fact,
the fact that sthe sum of the

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
lambdas, add up the lambdas,
equals the sum -- what would

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you like me to,
shall I write that down?

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What I'm want to say in words
is the sum down

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the diagonal of A.

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Shall I write a11+a22+...+ ann.

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's add up the diagonal
entries.

240
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In this example,
it's zero.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
In other words,
once I found this eigenvalue of

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
one, I knew the other one had to
be minus

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
one in this two by two case,
because in the two by two case,

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
which is a good one to,
to, play with,

245
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the trace tells you right away
what the other eigenvalue is.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So if I tell you one
eigenvalue, you can tell me the

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
other one.
We'll,
we'll have that -- we'll,

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
we'll see that again.

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,000
OK.
Now can I -- I could give more
examples, but maybe it's time to

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
face the, the equation,
Ax equal lambda x,

251
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and figure how are we going to
find x and lambda.

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
OK.

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So this, so the question now is
how to find eigenvalues and

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
eigenvectors.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How to solve,
how to solve Ax equal lambda x

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,790
when we've got two unknowns both
in the equation.

257
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,000
OK.

258
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,600
Here's the trick.

259
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
Simple idea.

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Bring this onto the
same side.

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Rewrite.

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Bring this over as A minus
lambda times the identity x

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
equals zero.

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Right?
I have Ax minus lambda x,
so I brought that over and I've

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
got zero left on the,
on the right-hand side.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,000
OK.
I don't know lambda and I don't
know x, but I do know something

267
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,000
here.
What I know is if I,
if I'm going to be able to

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
solve this thing,
for some x that's not the zero

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
vector, that's not,
that's a useless eigenvector,

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
doesn't count.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What I know now is that
this matrix must be what?

272
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If I'm going to be -- if there
is an x -- I don't -- right now

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know what it is.

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm going to find lambda first,
actually.

275
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And -- but if there is an x,
it tells me that this matrix,

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
this special combination,
which is like the matrix A with

277
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
lambda -- shifted by lambda,
shifted by lambda I,

278
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that it has to be singular.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This matrix must be singular,
otherwise the only x would be

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the zero x, and zero matrix.OK.

281
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So this is singular.

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And what do I now know about
singular matrices?

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Their determinant is zero.

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So I've -- so from the fact
that that has to be singular,

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I know that the determinant of
A minus lambda I has to be zero.

286
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And that, now I've got x out of
it.

287
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've got an equation for
lambda, that the key equation --

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,350
it's called the characteristic
equation or the eigenvalue

289
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,000
equation.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And that -- in other words,
I'm now in a position to find

291
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
lambda first.

292
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So -- the idea will be to find
lambda first.

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,670
And actually,
I won't find one lambda,

294
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll find N different lambdas.

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, n lambdas,
maybe not n different

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
ones.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
A lambda could be repeated.

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
A repeated lambda is the source
of all trouble in 18.06.

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So, let's hope for the moment
that they're not repeated.

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There, there they were
different, right?

301
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
One and minus one in that,
in that, for that permutation.

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,000
OK.
So and after I found this
lambda, can I just look ahead?

303
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
How I going to find x?

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
After I have found this lambda,
the lambda being this -- one of

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
the numbers that makes this
matrix singular.

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Then of course finding x is
just by elimination.

307
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right?
It's just -- now I've got a
singular matrix,

308
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm looking for the null space.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We're experts at finding the
null space.

310
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You know, you do elimination,
you identify the,

311
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the, the pivot columns and so
on,

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you're -- and,
give values to the free

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
variables.

314
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,830
Probably there'll only be one
free variable.

315
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,000
We'll give it the value one,
like there.

316
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And we find the other variable.

317
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
OK.

318
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,210
So let's -- find the x second
will be a doable job.

319
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,650
Let's go, let's look at the
first job of finding lambda.

320
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:56,000
OK.

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Can I take another example?

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And let's, let's work that one
out.

323
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OK.

324
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So let me take the example,
say, let me make it easy.
it's just sitting there.

325
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Three
three one and one.
what do you know about the
complex numbers?

326
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So I've made it easy.

327
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I've made it two by two.

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I've made it symmetric.

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And I even made it constant
down the diagonal.
That a matrix,
a perfectly real matrix could

330
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So that -- so the more,
like, special properties I

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
stick into the matrix,
the more special outcome I

332
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
get for the eigenvalues.

333
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
For example,
this symmetric matrix,

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I know that it'll come out with
real eigenvalues.

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The eigenvalues will turn out
to be nice real numbers.

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And up in our previous example,
that was a symmetric matrix.

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Actually, while we're at it,
that was a symmetric matrix.

338
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Its eigenvalues were nice real
numbers, one and minus one.

339
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And do you notice anything
about its eigenvectors?

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Anything particular about those
two vectors, one one and minus
And now comes that thing that I
wanted to be reminded of.

341
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
one one?

342
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They just happen to be -- no,
I can't say they just happen to

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
be, because that's the whole
point, is that they had to be --

344
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,460
what?

345
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,000
What are they?

346
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
They're perpendicular.

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,500
The vector, when I -- if I see
a vector one one and a one --

348
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,000
and a minus one one,
my mind immediately takes that

349
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000
dot product.
It's zero.
what's the determinant of that
matrix?

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Those vectors are
perpendicular.

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That'll happen here too.

352
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, let's find the
eigenvalues.

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Actually, oh,
my example's too easy.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
My example is too easy.

355
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Let me tell you in advance
what's going to happen.

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,130
May I?

357
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,000
Or shall I do the determinant
of A minus lambda,

358
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and then point out at the end?

359
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Will you remind me at the --
after I've found the

360
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,050
eigenvalues to say why they
were -- why they were easy from

361
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,000
the, from the example we did?

362
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
OK, let's do the job here.

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Let's compute determinant of A
minus lambda I.

364
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So that's a determinant.

365
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And what's,
what is this thing?

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's the matrix A with lambda
removed from the diagonal.

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So the diagonal matrix is
shifted, and then I'm taking the

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
determinant.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
OK.

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,450
So I multiply this out.

371
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,000
So what is that determinant?

372
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you notice,
I didn't take lambda away from

373
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
all the entries.

374
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's lambda I,
so it's lambda along the

375
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
diagonal.

376
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So I get three minus lambda
squared and then minus one,

377
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
right?

378
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And I want that to be zero.

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Well, I'm going to simplify it.

380
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And what will I get?

381
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,300
So if I multiply this out,
I get lambda squared minus six

382
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,000
lambda plus what?

383
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Plus eight.
But it's out there.

384
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And that I'm going to set to
zero.

385
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And I'm
going to solve it.

386
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So and it's,
it's a quadratic equation.

387
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I can use factorization,
I can use the quadratic

388
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
formula.

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'll get two lambdas.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Before I do it,
tell me what's that number six

391
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that's showing up in this
equation?

392
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's the trace.

393
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That number six is three plus
three.

394
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And while we're at it,
what's the number eight that's

395
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
showing up in this equation?

396
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's the determinant.

397
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,410
That our matrix has determinant
eight.

398
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,950
So in a two by two case,
it's really nice.

399
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,000
It's lambda squared minus the
trace times lambda -- the trace

400
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
is the linear coefficient -- and
plus the determinant,

401
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
the constant term.

402
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OK.
So let's -- can,
can we find the roots?

403
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I guess the easy way is to
factor that as something times

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
something.

405
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
If we couldn't factor it,
then we'd have to use the old

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
b^2-4ac formula,
but I, I think we can factor

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that into lambda minus what
times lambda minus what?

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Can you do that factorization?

409
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Four and two?

410
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Lambda minus four times lambda
minus two.

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,610
So the, the eigenvalues are
four and two.

412
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,000
So the eigenvalues are -- one
eigenvalue, lambda one,

413
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
let's say, is four.

414
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Lambda two, the other
eigenvalue, is two.

415
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The eigenvalues are four and
two.

416
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And then I can go for the
eigenvectors.
Suppose I have a matrix A,
and Ax equal lambda x.

417
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You see I got the eigenvalues
first.

418
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Four and two.

419
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Now for the eigenvectors.

420
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So what are the eigenvectors?

421
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
They're these guys in the null
space when I take away,

422
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
when I make the matrix singular
by

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
taking four I or two I away.

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So we're -- we got to do those
separately.

425
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll -- let me find the
eigenvector for four first.

426
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So I'll subtract four,
so A minus four I is -- so

427
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
taking four away will put minus
ones there.

428
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And what's the point
about that matrix?

429
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,840
If four is an eigenvalue,
then A minus four I had better

430
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,000
be a what kind of matrix?

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Singular.

432
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If that matrix isn't singular,
the four wasn't correct.

433
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But we're OK,
that matrix is singular.

434
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And what's the x now?

435
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
The x is in the null
space.

436
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,080
So what's the x1 that goes
with, with the lambda one?
eigenvalue, eigenvector,
eigenvalue for this,

437
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,000
So that A -- so this is -- now
I'm doing A x1 is lambda one x1.

438
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I took A minus lambda one I,
that's this matrix,

439
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and now I'm looking for the x1
in its null space,

440
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and who is he?

441
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What's the vector x in the null
space?

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Of course it's one one.

443
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So that's the eigenvector that
goes with that eigenvalue.

444
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Now how about the eigenvector
that goes with the other

445
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,700
eigenvalue?

446
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,000
Can I do that with,
with erasing?

447
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I take A minus two I.

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,940
So now I take two away from the
diagonal, and that leaves me

449
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,000
with a one and a one.

450
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So A minus two I has again
produced a singular matrix,

451
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
as it had to.

452
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm looking for the null space
of that guy.

453
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What vector is in its null
space?

454
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, of course,
a whole line of vectors.

455
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So when I say the eigenvector,
I'm not speaking correctly.

456
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There's a whole line of
eigenvectors,

457
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and you just -- I just want a
basis.

458
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And for a line I just want one
vector.

459
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But -- You could,
you're -- there's some freedom

460
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,140
in choosing that one,
but choose a reasonable one.

461
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,000
What's a vector in the null
space of that?

462
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well, the natural vector to
pick as the eigenvector with,

463
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
with lambda two is minus one
one.

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If I did elimination on that
vector and set that,

465
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,530
the free variable to be one,
I would get minus one and get

466
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,000
that eigenvector.

467
00:29:12,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So you see then that
I've got eigenvector,

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:22:08,000
for this matrix?

469
00:17:13,000 --> 00:12:02,240
What's the relation between
that problem and -- let me write

470
00:12:02,240 --> 00:10:44,000
just above what we2
found here.

471
00:15:59,000 --> 00:21:43,000
minus one and eigenvectors one
one and eigenvector minus one

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:22:06,000
one.

473
00:22:06,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And what do you notice?

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:30:11,000
What's -- how is this matrix
related to that matrix?

475
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How are those two matrices
related?

476
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, one is just three I more
than the other one,

477
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
right?
two.

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I just took that matrix and I
-- I took this matrix and I

479
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
added three I.

480
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So my question is,
what happened to the

481
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
eigenvalues and
what happened to the

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
eigenvectors?

483
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's the, that's like the
question we keep asking now in

484
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
this chapter.

485
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If I, if I do something to the
matrix, what happens if I -- or

486
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I know something about the
matrix, what's the what's the

487
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
conclusion for its eigenvectors
and

488
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
eigenvalues?

489
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Because -- those eigenvalues
and eigenvectors are going to

490
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,280
tell us important information
about the matrix.

491
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,000
And here what are we seeing?

492
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
What's happening to these
eigenvalues, one and minus one,

493
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
when I add three
I?

494
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It just added three to the
eigenvalues.

495
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I got four and two,
three more than one and minus

496
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,000
one.
What happened to the
eigenvectors?

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Nothing at all.

498
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,750
One one is -- and minus -- and
one -- and minus

499
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,000
one one are -- is still the
eigenvectors.

500
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
In other words,
simple but useful observation.

501
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If I add three I to a matrix,
its eigenvectors don't change

502
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,920
and its eigenvalues are three
bigger.

503
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's, let's just see why.

504
00:31:42,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Let me keep all
this on the same board.

505
00:14:48,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now I add three I to that
matrix.

506
00:07:10,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you see what3
so it's if Ax equals lambda x,

507
00:05:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
then this, this other new
matrix, I just have an Ax,

508
00:11:54,000 --> 00:16:36,000
which is lambda x,
and I have a three x,

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:21:03,000
from the three x,
so it's just I mean,

510
00:23:56,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Lambda plus three x.

511
00:26:20,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So if they, if this had
eigenvalue lambda,

512
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
this has eigenvalue lambda plus
three.

513
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And x, the eigenvector,
is the same x for both

514
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,840
matrices.

515
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,000
OK.

516
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So that's, great.

517
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Of course, it's special.

518
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,750
We got the new matrix by adding
three I.

519
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,000
Suppose I had added another
matrix.

520
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Suppose I know the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of A.

521
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So this is, this,
this little board here is going

522
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
to be not so great.

523
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Suppose I have a matrix A and
it has an eigenvector x with

524
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
an eigenvalue lambda.
You remember,
I solve A minus lambda I x

525
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And now I add on some other
matrix.

526
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So, so what I'm asking you is,
if you know the eigenvalues of

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,590
A and you know the eigenvalues
of B, let me say suppose B -- so

528
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,000
this is if -- let me put an if
here.

529
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
If Ax equals lambda x,
fine, and B has,

530
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
eigenvalues,
has eigenvalues -- what shall

531
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
we call them?

532
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Alpha, alpha one and alpha --
let's say -- I'll use alpha for

533
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the eigenvalues of B for no good
reason.

534
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:18,000
What a- you see what I'm going
to ask is, how about A plus B?

535
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Let me, let me give you the,
let me give you,

536
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
what you might think first.

537
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
OK.

538
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,310
If Ax equals lambda x and if B
has an eigenvalue alpha,

539
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:39,130
then I allowed to say -- what's
the matter with this argument?

540
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,000
It's wrong.

541
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,420
What I'm going to write up is
wrong.

542
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm going to say Bx is alpha x.

543
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Add those up,
and you get A plus B x equals

544
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
lambda plus alpha x.

545
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So you would think that if you
know the eigenvalues of A and

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,660
you knew the eigenvalues of B,
then if you added you would

547
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,500
know the eigenvalues of A plus
B.

548
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,000
But that's false.

549
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
A plus B -- well,
when B was three I,

550
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
that worked great.

551
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But this is not so great.

552
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And what's the matter with that
argument there?

553
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,050
We have no reason to believe
that x is also an eigenvector of

554
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,000
B.

555
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,940
B has some
eigenvalues,

556
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,480
but it's got some different
eigenvectors normally.

557
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,000
It's a different matrix.

558
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know anything special.

559
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If I don't know anything
special, then as far as I know,

560
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's got some different
eigenvector y,

561
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and when I add I
get just rubbish.

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean, I get -- I can add,
but I don't learn anything.

563
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So not so great is A plus B.

564
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Or A times B.

565
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Normally the eigenvalues of A
plus B or A times B are not

566
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,320
eigenvalues of A plus
eigenvalues of B.

567
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,000
Ei- eigenvalues are not,
like, linear.

568
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Or -- and they don't multiply.

569
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Because, eigenvectors are
usually different and,

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and there's just no way to find
out what A plus B does to affect

571
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
it.

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OK.
So that's, like,
a caution.

573
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Don't, if B is a multiple of
the identity,

574
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
great, but if B is some general
matrix, then for A plus B you've

575
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,510
got to find -- you've got to
solve the eigenvalue problem.

576
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:52,000
OK.

577
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Now I want to do another
example that brings out a,

578
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
another point about
eigenvalues.

579
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,440
Let me make this example a
rotation matrix.

580
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,850
OK.

581
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,000
So here's another example.

582
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So a rotate -- oh,
I'd better call it Q.

583
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,990
I often use Q for,
for, rotations because those

584
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:29,000
are the, like,
very important examples of

585
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
orthogonal matrices.

586
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Let me make it a ninety degree
rotation.

587
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So -- my matrix is going to be
the one that rotates every

588
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
vector by ninety degrees.

589
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So do you remember
that matrix?

590
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's the cosine of ninety
degrees, which is zero,

591
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the sine of ninety degrees,
which is one,

592
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
minus the sine of ninety,
the cosine of ninety.

593
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So that matrix deserves the
letter Q.

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's an orthogonal matrix,
very, very orthogonal matrix.

595
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now I'm interested in its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

596
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Two by two, it can't be that
tough.

597
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We know that the eigenvalues
add to zero.

598
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Actually, we know something
already here.

599
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The eigen- what's the sum of
the two eigenvalues?

600
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Just tell
me what I just said.

601
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Zero, right.

602
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
From that trace business.

603
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The sum of the eigenvalues is,
is going to come out zero.

604
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And the product of the
eigenvalues, did I tell you

605
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,390
about the determinant
being the product of the

606
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,000
eigenvalues?

607
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No.
But that's a good thing to
know.

608
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We pointed out how that eight
appeared in the,

609
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
in the quadratic equation.

610
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So let me just say this.

611
00:39:04,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The trace is zero plus zero,
obviously.

612
00:37:36,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And that's the sum,
that's lambda one plus lambda

613
00:29:42,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Now the other neat fact is that
the determinant,

614
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:20,000
One.

615
00:16:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And that is lambda one times
lambda3

616
00:09:30,000 --> 00:10:00,000
two.

617
00:10:00,000 --> 00:14:40,000
In our example,
the one we worked out,

618
00:14:40,000 --> 00:20:06,030
we -- the eigenvalues came out
four and two.

619
00:20:06,030 --> 00:23:07,000
Their product was eight.

620
00:23:07,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That -- it had to be eight,
because we factored into lambda

621
00:30:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
minus four times lambda minus
two.

622
00:34:36,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That gave us the constant term
eight.

623
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And that was the determinant.

624
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
OK.

625
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What I'm leading up to with
this example is that something's

626
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
going to go wrong.

627
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Something goes wrong for
rotation because what vector can

628
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
come out parallel to itself
after a rotation?

629
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,230
If this matrix rotates every
vector by ninety degrees,

630
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,000
what could be an eigenvector?

631
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Do you see we're,
we're, we're going to have

632
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
trouble.
eigenvectors are -- Well.

633
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,750
Our, our picture of
eigenvectors,

634
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,000
of, of coming out in the same
direction that they went in,

635
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,410
there won't be it.

636
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,000
And with, and with eigenvalues
we're going to have trouble.

637
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
From these equations.

638
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Let's see.

639
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Why I expecting trouble?

640
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,500
The, the first equation says
that the

641
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
eigenvalues add to zero.

642
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,910
So there's a plus and a minus.

643
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:07,000
But then the second equation
says that the product is plus

644
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
one.

645
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We're in trouble.

646
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But there's a way out.

647
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So how -- let's do the usual
stuff.

648
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Look at determinant of Q minus
lambda I.

649
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So I'll just follow the rules,
take the determinant,

650
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
subtract lambda from the
diagonal, where I had zeros,

651
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the rest is the same.

652
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Rest of Q is just copied.

653
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Compute that determinant.

654
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
OK, so what does that
determinant equal?

655
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Lambda squared minus minus one
plus what?

656
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What's up?

657
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
There's my equation.

658
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
My equation for the eigenvalues
is lambda squared plus one

659
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
equals zero.

660
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
What are the eigenvalues lambda
one

661
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and lambda two?

662
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:19,000
They're I, whatever that is,
and minus it,

663
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
right.

664
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:30,750
Those are the right numbers.

665
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:36,000
To be real numbers even though
the matrix was perfectly real.

666
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So this can happen.

667
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Complex numbers are going to --
have to enter eighteen oh six at

668
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
this moment.

669
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Boo, right.

670
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
All right.

671
00:42:48,000 --> 00:39:01,150
If I just choose good
matrices that have real

672
00:39:01,150 --> 00:31:59,000
eigenvalues, we can postpone
that evil day,

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:24:28,000
but just so you see -- so I'll
try to do that.

674
00:14:06,000 --> 00:06:05,000
have, give a perfectly
innocent-looking quadratic

675
00:06:05,000 --> 00:08:14,670
thing,4
but the roots of that quadratic

676
00:08:14,670 --> 00:11:57,000
can be complex numbers.

677
00:11:57,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And of course you -- everybody
knows that they're -- what,

678
00:27:54,020 --> 00:37:05,000
So, so now -- Let's just spend
one more minute on this bad

679
00:37:05,000 --> 00:43:31,000
possibility of complex numbers.

680
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We do know a little information
about the, the two complex

681
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,080
numbers.

682
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,000
They're complex conjugates of
each other.

683
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If, if lambda is an eigenvalue,
then when I change,

684
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
when I go -- you remember what
complex conjugates are?

685
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You switch the sign of the
imaginary part.

686
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Well, this was only imaginary,
had no real part,

687
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
so we just switched its sign.

688
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So that eigenvalues come in
pairs like that,

689
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but they're complex.

690
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
A complex conjugate pair.

691
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And that can happen
with a perfectly real matrix.

692
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And as a matter of fact -- so
that was my, my point earlier,

693
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that if a matrix was symmetric,
it wouldn't happen.

694
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,570
So if we stick to matrices that
are symmetric or,

695
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,000
like, close to symmetric,
then the eigenvalues will stay

696
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
real.

697
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But if we move far away
from symmetric -- and that's as

698
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
far as you can move,
because that matrix is -- how

699
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
is Q transpose related to Q for
that matrix?

700
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That matrix is anti-symmetric.

701
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Q transpose is minus Q.

702
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,500
That's the very opposite of
symmetry.

703
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,000
When I flip across the diagonal
I get -- I reverse all the

704
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
signs.

705
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Those are the guys that have
pure imaginary eigenvalues.

706
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So they're the extreme case.

707
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And in between are,
are matrices that are not

708
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
symmetric or anti-symmetric but,
but they have partly a

709
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
symmetric
part and an anti-symmetric

710
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,000
part.
OK.

711
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,000
So I'm doing a bunch of
examples here to show the

712
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
possibilities.

713
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The good possibilities being
perpendicular eigenvectors,

714
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
real eigenvalues.

715
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The bad possibilities being
complex eigenvalues.

716
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We could say that's bad.

717
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There's another even worse.

718
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm getting through the,
the bad things here today.

719
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Then, then the next lecture
can, can, can be like pure

720
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
happiness.

721
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,000
OK.
Here's one more bad thing
that could happen.

722
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So I, again,
I'll do it with an example.

723
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Suppose my matrix is,
suppose I take this three three

724
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
one and I change that guy to
zero.

725
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,180
What are the eigenvalues of
that matrix?

726
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,000
What are the eigenvectors?

727
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
This is
always our question.

728
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,540
Of course, the next section
we're going to show why are,

729
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,000
why do we care.

730
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But for the moment,
this lecture is introducing

731
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000
them.
And let's just find them.

732
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
OK.
What are the eigenvalues of
that matrix?

733
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Let me tell you -- at a glance
we could answer that question.

734
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because the matrix is
triangular.

735
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's really useful to know --
if you've got properties like a

736
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
triangular matrix.

737
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's very useful to know you
can read the eigenvalues

738
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,000
off.
They're right on the diagonal.

739
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So the eigenvalue is three and
also three.

740
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,430
Three is a repeated eigenvalue.

741
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,000
But let's see that happen.

742
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Let me do it right.

743
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The determinant of A minus
lambda I, what I always have to

744
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
do is this
determinant.

745
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I take away lambda from the
diagonal.

746
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I leave the rest.

747
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I compute the determinant,
so I get a three minus lambda

748
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
times a three minus lambda.

749
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And nothing.

750
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So that's where the triangular
part came in.

751
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Triangular part,
the one thing we know about

752
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
triangular matrices is the
determinant is just the product

753
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
down the diagonal.

754
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And in this case,
it's this same,

755
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
repeated -- so lambda one is
one -- sorry,

756
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
lambda one is three and lambda
two is three.

757
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That was easy.

758
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I mean, no -- why should I be
pessimistic about a matrix whose

759
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,070
eigenvalues can be read off
right away?

760
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,000
The problem with this matrix is
in the eigenvectors.

761
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So let's go to the
eigenvectors.

762
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,300
So how do I find the
eigenvectors?

763
00:48:17,300 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm looking for a couple of
eigenvectors.

764
00:41:01,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So I take the eigenvalue.

765
00:36:28,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What do I do now?

766
00:26:17,000 --> 00:24:06,000
equals zero.

767
00:24:06,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And what is A minus lambda I x?

768
00:18:28,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, so take three away.

769
00:14:18,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And I get this matrix4
zero zero zero one,

770
00:13:12,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Times x is supposed to give me
zero, right?

771
00:20:50,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That's my big equation for x.

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:33:01,010
Now I'm looking for x,
the eigenvector.

773
00:33:01,010 --> 00:43:11,000
So I took A minus lambda I x,
and what kind of a matrix I

774
00:43:11,000 --> 00:49:00,480
supposed to have here?

775
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,000
Singular, right?

776
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's supposed to be singular.

777
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And then it's got some vectors
-- which it is.

778
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So it's got some vector x in
the null space.

779
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And what, what's the,
what's -- give me a basis for

780
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the null space for that guy.

781
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Tell me, what's a vector x in
the null space,

782
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
so that'll be the,
the eigenvector that goes with

783
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
lambda one equals three.

784
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The eigenvector is -- so what's
in the null space?

785
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
One zero, is it?

786
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Great.

787
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Now, what's the other
eigenvector?

788
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
What's, what's the eigenvector
that goes with lambda two?

789
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Well, lambda two is three
again.

790
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So I get the same thing again.

791
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Give me another vector -- I
want it to be independent.

792
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,440
If I'm going to write
down an x2, I'm never going to

793
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,000
let it be dependent on x1.

794
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm looking for independent
eigenvectors,

795
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and what's the conclusion?

796
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
There isn't one.

797
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,660
This is a degenerate matrix.

798
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:21,000
It's only got one line of
eigenvectors instead of two.

799
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's this possibility of a
repeated eigenvalue opens this

800
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
further possibility of a
shortage of eigenvectors.

801
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And so there's no second
independent eigenvector x2.

802
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,090
So it's a matrix,
it's a two by two matrix,

803
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,000
but with
only one independent

804
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
eigenvector.

805
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So that will be -- the matrices
that -- where eigenvectors are

806
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
-- don't give the complete
story.

807
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
OK.

808
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
My lecture on Monday will give
the complete story for all the

809
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
other matrices.

810
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Thanks.

811
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,960
Have a good weekend.

812
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,000
A real New England weekend.
