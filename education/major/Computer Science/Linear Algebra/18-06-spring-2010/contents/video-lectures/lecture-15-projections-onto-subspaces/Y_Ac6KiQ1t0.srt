1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
OK, guys the -- we're almost
ready to make this lecture

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
immortal.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
OK.
Are we on?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All right.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is an important lecture.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's about projections.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me start by just projecting
a vector b down on a vector a.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,070
So just to so you see what the
geometry looks like in when I'm

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,000
in --
in just two dimensions,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'd like to find the point
along this line so that line

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
through a is a one-dimensional
subspace, so I'm starting with

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
one dimension.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'd like to find the point on
that line closest to a.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Can I just take that problem
first and then I'll explain why

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I want to do it and why I want
to project on other subspaces.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So where's the point closest to
b that's on that line?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,160
It's somewhere there.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,000
And let me connect that and --
and what's the whole point of my

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
picture now?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's the -- where does
orthogonality come into this

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
picture?

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The whole point is that this
best point, that's the

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
projection, P,
of b onto the line,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
where's orthogonality?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's the fact that that's a
right angle.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That this -- the error -- this
is like how much I'm wrong by --

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
this is the difference between b
and P, the whole point is --

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that's perpendicular to a.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's got to give us the
equation.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's got to tell us -- that's
the one fact we know,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that's got to tell us where
that projection is.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me also say,
look -- I've drawn a triangle

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
there.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So if we were doing
trigonometry we would do like we

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
would have angles theta and
distances that would involve

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
sine theta and cos theta that
leads to lousy formulas compared

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to linear algebra.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The formula that we want comes
out nicely and what's the --

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
what do we know?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We know that P,
this projection,

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is some multiple of a,
right?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's on that line.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we know it's in that
one-dimensional subspace,

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
it's some multiple,
let me call that multiple x,

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of a.
So really it's that number x
I'd like to find.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So this is going to be simple
in 1-D, so let's just carry it

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
through, and then see how it
goes in high dimensions.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OK.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The key fact is -- the key to
everything is that

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
perpendicular.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,270
The fact that a is
perpendicular to a is

52
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,000
perpendicular to e.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Which is (b-ax),
xa.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't care what -- xa.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That that equals zero.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you see that as the central
equation, that's saying that

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
this a is perpendicular to this
-- correction,

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that's going to tell us what x
is.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let me just raise the board and
simplify that and out will come

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
x.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OK.
So if I simplify that,
let's see, I'll move one to --

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
one term to one side,
the other term will be on the

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
other side, it looks to me like
x times a transpose a is equal

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to a transpose b.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Right?
I have a transpose b as one f-
one term, a transpose a as the

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
other, so right away here's my a
transpose a.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But it's just a number now.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I divide by it.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I get the answer.
x is a transpose b over a

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
transpose a.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,730
And P, the projection I wanted,
is -- that's the right

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,000
multiple.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's got a cosine theta built
in.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But we don't need to look at
angles.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's -- we've just got vectors
here.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And the projection is P is a
times that x.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Or x times that a.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But I'm really going to --
eventually I'm going to want

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that x coming on the right-hand
side.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So do you see that I've got two
of the three formulas already,

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
right here, I've got the --
that's the equation -- that

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,660
leads me to the answer,
here's the answer for x,

83
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,000
and here's the projection.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
OK.
can I do add just one more

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,600
thing to this one-dimensional
problem?

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,000
One more like lift it up into
linear algebra,

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
into matrices.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Here's the last thing I want to
do -- but don't forget those

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
formulas.
a transpose b over a transpose

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
a.
Actually let's look at that for
a moment first.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Suppose --
Let me take this next step.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So P is a times x.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,550
So can I write that then?

94
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,000
P is a times this neat number,
a transpose b over a transpose

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
a.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
That's our projection.

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Can I ask a couple of questions
about it, just while we look,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
get that digest that formula.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Suppose b is doubled.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Suppose I change b to two b.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What happens to the projection?

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So suppose I instead of that
vector b that I drew on the

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
board make it two b,
twice as long -- what's the

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
projection now?

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's doubled too,
right?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's going to be twice as far,
if b goes twice as far,

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the projection will go twice as
far.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And you see it there.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If I put in an extra factor
two, then P's got that factor

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
too.
Now what about if I double a?

111
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,000
What if I double the vector a
that I'm projecting onto?

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What changes?

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The projection doesn't change
at all.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Right?
Because I'm just -- the line
didn't change.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I double a or I take minus
a.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's still that same line.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The projection's still in the
same place.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And of course if I double a I
get a four up above,

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and I get a four --
an extra four below,

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
they cancel out,
and the projection is the same.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
OK.
So really, this -- I want to
look at this as the projection

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
-- there's a matrix here.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,580
The projection is carried out
by some matrix that I'm going to

124
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,620
call the projection matrix.

125
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,000
And in other words the
projection is some matrix that

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,280
acts on this guy b and produces
the projection.

127
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,000
The projection P is the
projection matrix acting on

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
whatever the input is.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The input is b,
the projection matrix is P.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OK.
Actually you can tell me right
away what this projection matrix

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is.
So this is a pretty interesting
matrix.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What matrix is multiplying b?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm just -- just from my
formula -- I see what P is.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
P, this projection matrix,
is -- what is it?

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I see a a transpose above,
and I see a transpose a below.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And those don't cancel.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's not one.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right?

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's a matrix.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,420
Because down here,
the a transpose a,

141
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,000
that's just a number,
a transpose a,

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that's the length of a squared,
and up above is a column times

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a row.
Column times a row is a matrix.

144
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,000
So this is a full-scale n by n
matrix, if I --

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
if I'm in n dimensions.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,320
And it's kind of an interesting
one.

147
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,000
And it's the one which if I
multiply by b then I get this,

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
you see once again I'm putting
parentheses in different places.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,690
I'm putting the parentheses
right there.

150
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm saying OK,
that's really the matrix that

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
produces this projection.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OK.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,750
Now, tell me -- all right,
what are the properties of that

154
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,000
matrix?

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm just using letters here,
a and b, I could put in

156
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,000
numbers, but I think it's -- for
once, it's clearer with letters,

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because all formulas are
simple, a transpose b over a

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
transpose a --
that's the number that

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
multiplies the a,
and then I see wait a minute,

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
there's a matrix here and
what's the rank of that matrix,

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
by the way?

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What's the rank of that matrix,
yeah -- let me just ask you

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
about that matrix.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Which looks a little strange,
a a transpose over this number.

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But well, I could ask you its
column space.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, let me ask you its column
space.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So what's the column space of a
matrix?

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you multiply that matrix by
anything you always get in the

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
column space,
right?

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The column space of a matrix is
when you multiply any vector by

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that matrix --
any vector b,

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
by the matrix,
you always land in the column

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
space.

174
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,000
That's what column spaces work.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,260
Now what space do we always
land in?

176
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,540
What's the column space of --
what's the result when I

177
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,000
multiply this any vector b by my
matrix?

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,010
So I have P times b,
where I?

179
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm on that line,
right?

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,620
The column space,
so here are facts about this

181
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,000
matrix.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The column space of P,
of this projection matrix,

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is the line through a.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And the rank of this matrix is
you can all say it at once one.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Right.
The rank is one.

186
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,000
This is a rank one matrix.

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Actually it's exactly the form
that we're familiar with a rank

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
one matrix.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,250
A column times a row,
that's a rank one matrix,

190
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,000
that column is the basis for
the column space.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just one dimension.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
OK.
So I know that much about the
matrix.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But now there are two more
facts about the matrix that I

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
want to notice.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
First of all is the matrix
symmetric?

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,130
That's a natural question for
matrices.

197
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,000
And the answer is yes.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If I take the transpose of this
--

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
there's a number down there,
the transpose of a a transpose

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
is a a transpose.

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So P is symmetric.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
P transpose equals P.

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So this is a key property.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That the projection matrix is
symmetric.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
One more property now and this
is the real one.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What happens if I do the
projection twice?

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So I'm looking for something,
some information about P

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
squared.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But just give me in terms of
that picture,

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in terms my picture,
I take any vector b,

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I multiply it by my projection
matrix, and that puts me there,

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
so this is Pb.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And now I project again.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What happens now?

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What happens when I apply the
projection matrix a second time?

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,450
To this, so I'm applying it
once brings me here and the

217
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,000
second time brings me I stay
put.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Right?

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The projection for a point on
this line the projection is

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
right where it is.

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The projection is the same
point.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So that means that if I project
twice, I get the same answer as

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I did in the first projection.

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So those are the two properties
that tell me I'm looking at a

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
projection matrix.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's symmetric and it's square
is itself.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because if I project a second
time, it's the same result as

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the first result.

229
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,250
OK.

230
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,000
So that's -- and then here's
the exact formula when I know

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,920
what I'm projecting onto,
that line through a,

232
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,000
then I know what P is.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So do you see that I have all
the pieces here for projection

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
on a line?

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Now, and those --
please remember those.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So there are three formulas to
remember.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The formula for x,
the formula for P,

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
which is just ax,
and then the formula for

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
capital P, which is the matrix.

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Good.

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Good.
OK.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Now I want to move to more
dimensions.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So we're going to have three
formulas again but you'll have

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to --
they'll be a little different

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because we won't have a single
line but -- a plane or

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
three-dimensional or a
n-dimensional subspace.

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
OK.
So now I'll move to the next
question.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe -- let me say first why I
want this projection,

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and then we'll figure out what
it is, we'll go completely in

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,270
parallel there,
and then we'll use it.

251
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,000
OK, why do I want this
projection?

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, so why project?

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's because I'm as I mentioned
last time this new chapter deals

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
with equations Ax=b may have no
solution.

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So that's really my problem,
that I'm given a bunch of

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
equations probably too many
equations, more equations than

257
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,700
unknowns, and I can't solve
them.

258
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,000
OK.

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So what do I do?

260
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I solve the closest problem
that I can solve.

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And what's the closest one?

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, ax will always be in the
column space of a.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's my problem.

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
My problem is ax has to be in
the column space and b is

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
probably not in the column
space.

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So I change b to what?

267
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I choose the closest vector in
the column space,

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,480
so I'll solve Ax equal P
instead.

269
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,000
That one I can do.

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Where P is this is the
projection of b onto the column

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
space.

272
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's why I want to be able to
do this.

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Because I have to find a
solution here,

274
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,100
and I'm going to put a little
hat there to indicate that it's

275
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,000
not the x, it's not the x that
doesn't exist,

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
it's the x hat that's best
possible.

277
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So I must be able to figure out
what's the good projection

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
there.

279
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's the good right-hand side
that is in the column space

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that's as close as possible to b
and then I'm -- then I know what

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to do.

282
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
OK.

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So now I've got that problem.

284
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So that's why I have the
problem again but now let me say

285
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm in three dimensions,
so I have a plane maybe for

286
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
example, and I have a vector b
that's not in the plane.

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And I want to project b down
into the plane.

288
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
OK.

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So there's my question.

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How do I project a vector and
I'm --

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
what I'm looking for is a nice
formula, and I'm counting on

292
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
linear algebra to just come out
right, a nice formula for the

293
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
projection of b into the plane.

294
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The nearest point.

295
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So this again a right angle is
going to be crucial.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,000
OK.
Now so what's -- first of all
I've got to say what is that

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
plane.

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
To get a formula I have to tell
you what the plane is.

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How I going to tell you a
plane?

300
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll tell you a basis for the
plane, I'll tell you two vectors

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
a one and a two that give you a
basis for the plane,

302
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so that -- let us say -- say
there's an a one and here's an a

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
-- a vector a two.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They don't have to be
perpendicular.

305
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But they better be independent,
because then that tells me the

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,000
plane.
The plane is the -- is the
plane of a one and a two.

307
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And actually going back to my
-- to this connection,

308
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
this plane is a column space,
it's the column space of what

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
matrix?

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What matrix,
so how do I connect the two

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
questions?

312
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm thinking how do I project
onto a plane and I want to get a

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
matrix in here.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Everything's cleaner if I write
it in terms of a matrix.

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So what matrix has these --
has that column space?

316
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,650
Well of course it's just the
matrix that has a one in the

317
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,000
first column and a two in the
second column.

318
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Right, just just let's be sure
we've got the question before we

319
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
get to the answer.

320
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So I'm looking for again I'm
given a matrix a with two

321
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
columns.

322
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And really I'm ready once I get
to two I'm ready for n.

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So it could be two columns,
it could be n columns.

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll write the answer in terms
of the matrix a.

325
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And the point will be those two
columns describe the plane,

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
they describe the column space,
and I want to project.

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OK.

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I'm given a vector b that's
probably not in the column

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,000
space.
Of course, if b is in the
column space,

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
my projection is simple,
it's just b.

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But most likely I have an error
e, this b minus P part,

332
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
which is probably not zero.

333
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
OK.

334
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,000
But the beauty is that I know
-- from geometry or I could get

335
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
it from calculus or I could get
it from linear algebra that that

336
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this this vector --
this is the part of b that's

337
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
that's perpendicular to the
plane.

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That e is perpendicular is
perpendicular to the plane.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If your intuition is saying
that that's the crucial fact.

340
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's going to give us the
answer.

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
OK.

342
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So let me, that's the problem.

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now for the answer.

344
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So this is a lecture that's
really like moving along.

345
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I'm just plotting that
problem up there and asking you

346
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,320
what combination -- now,
yeah, so what is it?

347
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,000
P.

348
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What is this projection P?

349
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is projection P,
is some multiple of these basis

350
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
guys, right, some multiple of
the columns.

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But I don't like writing out x
one a one plus x two a two,

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,700
I would rather right that as
ax.

353
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, actually I should put if
I'm really doing everything

354
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
right, I should put a little hat
on it --

355
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to remember that this x -- that
those are the numbers and I

356
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
could have a put a hat way back
there is right,

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
so this is this is the
projection, P.

358
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
P is ax bar.

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I'm looking for x bar.

360
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So that's what I want an
equation for.

361
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So now I've got hold of the
problem.

362
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The problem is find the right
combination of the columns so

363
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
that the error vector is
perpendicular to the plane.

364
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now let me turn that into an
equation.

365
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So I'll raise the board and
just turn that -- what we've

366
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
just done into an equation.

367
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So let me I'll write again the
main point.

368
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The projection is ax b- x hat.

369
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And our problem is find x hat.

370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And the key is that b minus ax
hat, that's the error.

371
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is the e.

372
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Is perpendicular to the plane.

373
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's got to give me well what
I looking for,

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm looking for two equations
now because I've got an x one

375
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and an x two.

376
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And I'll get two equations
because so this thing e is

377
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
perpendicular to the plane.

378
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So what does that mean?

379
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I guess it means it's
perpendicular to a one and also

380
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to a two.

381
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,270
Right, those are two vectors in
the plane and the things that

382
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:08,180
are perpendicular to the plane
are perpendicular to a one and a

383
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,000
two.

384
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let me just repeat.

385
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
This this guy then is
perpendicular to the plane so

386
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
it's perpendicular to that
vector and that vector.

387
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Not -- it's perpendicular to
that of course.

388
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But it's perpendicular to
everything I the plane.

389
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And the plane is really told me
by a one and a two.

390
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So really I have the equations
a one transpose b minus ax is

391
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
zero.

392
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And also a two transpose b
minus ax is zero.

393
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Those are my two equations.

394
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But I want those in matrix
form.

395
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I want to put those two
equations together as a matrix

396
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
equation and it's just comes out
right.

397
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Look at the matrix a transpose.

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Put a one a one transpose is
its first row,

399
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
a two transpose is its second
row, that multiplies this b-ax,

400
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and gives me the zero and the
zero.

401
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm you see the -- this is one
way -- to come up with this

402
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,220
equation.

403
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,000
So the equation I'm coming up
with is a transpose b-ax hat is

404
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
zero.

405
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,000
OK.
That's my equation.

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
All right.

407
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Now I want to stop for a moment
before I solve it and just think

408
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
about it.

409
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
First of all do you see that
that equation back in the very

410
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
first problem I solved on a
line, what was --

411
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,730
what was on a line the matrix a
only had one column,

412
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,000
it was just little a.

413
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So in the first problem I
solved, projecting on a line,

414
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
this for capital a you just
change that to little a and you

415
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,640
have the same equation that we
solved before.

416
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,000
a transpose e equals zero.

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
OK.
Now a second thing,
second comment.

418
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I would like to since I know
about these four subspaces,

419
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I would like to get them into
this picture.

420
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So let me ask the question,
what subspace is this thing in?

421
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,270
Which of the four subspaces is
that error vector e,

422
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:14,000
this is this is nothing but e
--

423
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this is this guy,
coming in down perpendicular to

424
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the plane.

425
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What subspace is e in?

426
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
From this equation.

427
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well the equation is saying a
transpose e is zero.

428
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I'm learning here that e is
in the null space of a

429
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
transpose.

430
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Right?
That's my equation.

431
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And now I just want to see hey
of course that that was right.

432
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Because things that are in the
null space of a transpose,

433
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
what do we know about the null
space of a transpose?

434
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So that last lecture gave us
the sort of the geometry of

435
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
these subspaces.

436
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And the orthogonality of them.

437
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And do you remember what it
was?

438
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What on the right side of our
big figure we always have the

439
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
null space of a transpose and
the column space of a,

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,910
and they're orthogonal.

441
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:35,000
So e in the null space of a
transpose is saying e is

442
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
perpendicular to the column
space of a.

443
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes.

444
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I just feel OK,
the damn thing came out right.

445
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The equation for the equation
that I struggled to find for e

446
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
really said what I wanted,
that the error e is

447
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
perpendicular to the column
space of a, just right.

448
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And from our four fundamental
subspaces we knew that that is

449
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the same as that.

450
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
To say e is in the null space
of a transpose says e's

451
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
perpendicular to the column
space.

452
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,000
OK.
So we've got this equation.

453
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,870
Now let's just solve it.

454
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,000
All right.

455
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me just rewrite it as a
transpose a x hat equals a

456
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
transpose b.

457
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's our equation.

458
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That gives us x.

459
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And -- allow me to keep
remembering the one-dimensional

460
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000
case.
The one-dimensional case,
this was little a.

461
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So this was just a number,
little a transpose,

462
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
a transpose a was just a vector
row times a column,

463
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
a number.

464
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And this was a number.

465
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And x was the ratio of those
numbers.

466
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But now we've got matrices,
this one is n by n.

467
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a transpose a is an n by n
matrix.

468
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
OK.

469
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So can I move to the next board
for the solution?

470
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
OK.

471
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is the --
the key equation.

472
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Now I'm ready for the formulas
that we have to remember.

473
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What's x hat?

474
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What's the projection,
what's the projection matrix,

475
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
those are my three questions.

476
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That we answered in the 1-D
case and now we're ready for in

477
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the n-dimensional case.

478
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So what is x hat?

479
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, what can I say but a
transpose a inverse,

480
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,250
a transpose b.

481
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,000
OK.

482
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's the solution to -- to
our equation.

483
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
What's the projection?

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's more interesting.

485
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What's the projection?

486
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
The projection is a x hat.

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,410
That's how x hat got into the
picture in the first place.

488
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:28,000
x hat was the was the
combination of columns in the I

489
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,310
had to look for those numbers
and now I found them.

490
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:38,000
Was the combination of the
columns of a that gave me the

491
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
projection.

492
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
OK.

493
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So now I know what this guy is.

494
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So it's just I multiply by a.
a a transpose a inverse a

495
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
transpose b.

496
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's looking a little messy
but it's not bad.

497
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That that combination is is our
like magic combination.

498
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This is the thing which is
which use which is like what's

499
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
it like, what was it in one
dimension?

500
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What was that we had this we
must have had this thing way

501
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
back at the beginning of the
lecture.

502
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What did we -- oh that a was
just a column so it was little

503
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
a, little a transpose over a
transpose a, right,

504
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that's what it was in 1-D.

505
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You see what's happened in more
dimensions, I --

506
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm not allowed to to just
divide because because I don't

507
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
have a number,
I have to put inverse,

508
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because I have an n by n
matrix.

509
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But same formula.

510
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And now tell me what's the
projection matrix?

511
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What matrix is multiplying b to
give the projection?

512
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Right there.

513
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,590
Because there it --
I even already underlined it by

514
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,000
accident.

515
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The projection matrix which I
use capital P is this,

516
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
it's it's that thing,
shall I write it again,

517
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
a times a transpose a inverse
times a transpose.

518
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Now if you'll bear with me I'll
think about what have I done

519
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,000
here.
I've got this formula.

520
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Now the first thing that occurs
to me is something bad.

521
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Look why don't I just you know
here's a product of two matrices

522
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,510
and I want its inverse,
why don't I just use the

523
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,450
formula I know for the inverse
of a product and say OK,

524
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,000
that's a inverse times a
transpose inverse,

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
what will happen if I do that?

526
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
What will happen if I say hey
this is a inverse times a

527
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
transpose inverse,
then shall I do it?

528
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's going to go on videotape
if I do it, and I don't -- all

529
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
right, I'll put it there,
but just like don't take the

530
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
videotape quite so carefully.

531
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK.
So if I put that thing it -- it
would be a a inverse a transpose

532
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,710
inverse a transpose and what's
that?

533
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,000
That's the identity.

534
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But what's going on?

535
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So why -- you see my question
is somehow I did something

536
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
wrong.

537
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,000
That that wasn't allowed.

538
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And and and why is that?

539
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,210
Because a is not a square
matrix.

540
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,860
a is not a square matrix.

541
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,000
It doesn't have an inverse.

542
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So I have to leave it that way.

543
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
This is not OK.

544
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
If if a was a square invertible
matrix, then then I couldn't

545
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
complain.

546
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah I think -- let me think
about that case.

547
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But you but my main case,
the whole reason I'm doing all

548
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
this, is that a is this matrix
that has x too many rows,

549
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it's just got a couple of
columns, like a one and a two,

550
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
but lots of rows.

551
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Not square.
And if it's not square,
this a transpose a is square

552
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but I can't pull it apart like
this --

553
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm not allowed to do this pull
apart, except if a was square.

554
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Now if a is square what's
what's going on if a is a square

555
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
matrix?
a nice square inv- invertible

556
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
matrix.

557
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Think.

558
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
What's up with that what's with
that case.

559
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So this is that the formula
ought to work then too.

560
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If a is a nice square
invertible matrix what's its

561
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
column space,
so it's a nice n by n

562
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
invertible everything great
matrix, what's its column space,

563
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
the whole of R^n.

564
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So what's the projection matrix
if I'm projecting onto the whole

565
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
space?

566
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's the identity matrix right?

567
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
If I'm projecting b onto the
whole space, not just onto a

568
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
plane, but onto all of 3-D,
then b is already in the column

569
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
space, the projection is the
identity, and this is gives me

570
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the correct formula,
P is I.

571
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But if I'm projecting onto a
subspace then I can't split

572
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
those apart and I have to stay
with that formula.

573
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,000
OK.
And what can I say if -- so I
remember this formula for 1-D

574
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,000
and that's what it looks like in
n dimensions.

575
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And what are the properties
that I expected for any

576
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
projection matrix?

577
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And I still expect for this
one?

578
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That matrix should be symmetric
and it is.

579
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,190
P transpose is P.

580
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,000
Because if I transpose this,
this guy's symmetric,

581
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and its inverse is symmetric,
and if I transpose this one

582
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
when I transpose it will pop up
there, become a,

583
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
that a transpose will pop up
here, and I'm back to P again.

584
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And do we dare try the other
property which is P squared

585
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
equal P?

586
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's got to be right.

587
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Because we know geometrically
that the first projection pops

588
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
us onto the column space and the
second one leaves us where we

589
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
are.
So I expect that if I multiply
by let me do it -- if I multiply

590
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
by another P,
so there's another a,

591
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
another a transpose a inverse a
transpose, can you --

592
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
eight (a)-s in a row is quite
obscene but -- do you see that

593
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
it works?

594
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,920
So I'm squaring that so what do
I do-- how do I see that

595
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
multiplication?

596
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, yeah, I just want to put
parentheses in good places,

597
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
so I see what's happening,
yeah, here's an a transpose a

598
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
sitting together --
so when that a transpose a

599
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
multiplies its inverse,
all that stuff goes,

600
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
right.

601
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And leaves just the a transpose
at the end, which is just what

602
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
we want.

603
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So P squared equals P.

604
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So sure enough those two
properties hold.

605
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OK.
OK we really have got now all
the formulas.

606
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
x hat, the projection P,
and the projection matrix

607
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
capital P.

608
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And now my job is to use them.

609
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,130
OK.

610
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,000
So when would I have a bunch of
equations, too many equations

611
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and yet I want the best answer
and the -- the most important

612
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
example, the most common example
is if I have points so here's

613
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the --
here's the application.

614
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
v squared.

615
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Fitting by a line.

616
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
OK.

617
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So I'll start this application
today and there's more in it

618
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
than I can do in this same
lecture.

619
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So that'll give me a chance to
recap the formulas and there

620
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
they are, and recap the ideas.

621
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So let me start the problem
today.

622
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm given a bunch of data
points.

623
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And they lie close to a line
but not on a line.

624
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Let me take that.

625
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Say a t equal to one,
two and three,

626
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I have one, and two and two
again.

627
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So my data points are this is
the like the time direction and

628
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
this is like well let me call
that b or y or something.

629
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm given these three points
and I want to fit them by a

630
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
line.

631
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,000
By the best straight line.

632
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So the problem is fit the
points one, one is the first

633
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
point --
the second point is t equals

634
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
two, b equal one,
and the third point is t equal

635
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
three, b equal to two.

636
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So those are my three points,
t equal sorry,that's two.

637
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, OK.

638
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,790
So this is the point one,
one.

639
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,000
This is the point two,
two, and that's the point

640
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
three, two.

641
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And of course there isn't a --
a line that goes through them.

642
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So I'm looking for the best
line.

643
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm looking for a line that
probably goes somewhere,

644
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
do you think it goes somewhere
like that?

645
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I didn't mean to make it go
through that point,

646
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
it won't.

647
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It'll kind of --
it'll go between so the error

648
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
there and the error there and
the error there are as small as

649
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,650
I can get them.

650
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,000
OK, what I'd like to do is find
the matrix a.

651
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Because once I've found the
matrix a the formulas take over.

652
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So what I'm looking for this
line, b is C+Dt.

653
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So this is in the homework that
I sent out for today.

654
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Find the best line.

655
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So I'm looking for these
numbers.

656
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
C and D.

657
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That tell me the line and I
want them to be as close to

658
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
going through those three points
as I can get.

659
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I can't get exactly so there
are three equations to go

660
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
through the three points.

661
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It would it will go exactly
through that point if let's see

662
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that first point has t equal to
one, so that would say C+D

663
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
equaled 1.

664
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,820
This is the one,
one.

665
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,000
The second point t is two.

666
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So C+2D should come out to
equal 2.

667
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But I also want to get the
third equation in and at that

668
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
third equation t is three so
C+3D equals only 2.

669
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,960
That's the key.

670
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,000
Is to write down what equations
we would like to solve but

671
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
can't.

672
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,120
Reason we if we could solve
them that would mean that we

673
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,000
could put a line through all
three points and of course if

674
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
these numbers one,
two, two were different,

675
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
we could do it.

676
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But with those numbers,
one, two, two,

677
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
we can't.

678
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,780
So what is our equation Ax
equal Ax equal b that we can't

679
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,000
solve?

680
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I just want to say what's the
matrix here, what's the unknown

681
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
x, and what's the right-hand
side.

682
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So this is the matrix is one,
one, one, one,

683
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
two, three.

684
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The unknown is C and D.

685
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And the right-hand side if one,
two, two.

686
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Right, I've just taken my
equations and I've said what is

687
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Ax and what is b.

688
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Then there's no solution,
this is the typical case where

689
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I have three equations --
two unknowns,

690
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
no solution,
but I'm still looking for the

691
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
best solution.

692
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And the best solution is taken
is is to solve not this equation

693
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Ax equal b which has which has
no solution but the equation

694
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that does have a solution,
which was this one.

695
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So that's the equation to
solve.

696
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's the central equation of
the subject.

697
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I can't solve Ax=b but
magically when I multiply both

698
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
sides by a transpose I get an
equation that I can solve and

699
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
its solution gives me x,
the best x, the best

700
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
projection, and I discover
what's the matrix that's behind

701
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it.

702
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,000
OK.
So next time I'll complete an
example, numerical example.

703
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
today was all letters,
numbers next time.

704
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Thanks.
