1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,000
-- and lift-off on differential
equations.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, this section is about how
to solve a system of first

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
order, first derivative,
constant coefficient linear

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
equations.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And if we do it right,
it turns directly into linear

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
algebra.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
The key idea is the solutions
to constant coefficient linear

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
equations are exponentials.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,570
So if you look for an
exponential, then all you have

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,000
to find is what's up there in
the exponent and what multiplies

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the exponential and that's the
linear algebra.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So -- and the result -- one
thing we will fine --

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
it's completely parallel to
powers of a matrix.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So the last lecture was about
how would you compute A to the K

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or A to the 100?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How do you compute high powers
of a matrix?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now it's not powers anymore,
but it's exponentials.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's the natural thing for
differential equation.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.
But can I begin with an
example?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I'll just go through the
mechanics.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How would I solve the
differential -- two differential

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
equations?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I'm going to make it -- I'll
have a two by two matrix and the

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
coefficients are minus one two,
one minus two and I'd better

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
give you some initial condition.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,539
So suppose it starts u at times
zero -- this is u1,

27
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,000
u2 -- let it -- let it --
suppose everything is in u1 at

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
times zero.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So -- at -- at the start,
it's all in u1.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But what happens as time goes
on,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
du2/dt will -- will be
positive, because of that u1

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
term, so flow will move into the
u2 component and it will go out

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of the u1 component.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So we'll just follow that
movement as time goes forward by

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
looking at the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that matrix.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,480
That's a first job.

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,720
Before you do anything else,
find the -- find the matrix and

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,000
its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So let me do that.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay.
So here's our matrix.

41
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,000
Maybe you can tell me right
away what -- what are the

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
eigenvalues and -- eigenvalues
anyway.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then we can check.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,270
But can you spot any of the
eigenvalues of that matrix?

45
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,000
We're looking for two
eigenvalues.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you see -- I mean,
if I just wrote that matrix

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
down, what -- what do you notice
about it?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's singular,
right.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That -- that's a singular
matrix.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That tells me right away that
one of the eigenvalues is lambda

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
equals zero.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can -- that's a singular
matrix, the second column is

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
minus two times the first
column, the determinant is zero,

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
it's -- it's singular,
so zero is an eigenvalue and

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,620
the other eigenvalue will
be -- from the trace.

56
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,000
I look at the trace,
the sum down the diagonal is

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
minus three.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That has to agree with the sum
of the eigenvalue,

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,150
so that second eigenvalue
better be minus three.

60
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,000
I could, of course -- I could
compute -- why don't I over

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
here -- compute the determinant
of A minus lambda I,

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the determinant of this minus
one minus lambda two one minus

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
two minus lambda matrix.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But we know what's coming.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When I do that multiplication,
I get a lambda squared.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I get a two lambda and a one
lambda,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that's a three lambda.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And then -- now I'm going to
get the determinant,

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
which is two minus two which is
zero.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So there's my characteristic
polynomial, this determinant.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And of course I factor that
into lambda times lambda plus

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
three and I get the two
eigenvalues

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that we saw coming.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What else do I need?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The eigenvectors.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So before I even think about
the differential equation or

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
what -- how to solve it,
let me find the eigenvectors

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
for this matrix.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So take lambda equals zero --
so that -- that's the first

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
eigenvalue.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Lambda one equals zero and the
second eigenvalue will be lambda

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
two equals minus three.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
By the way, I -- I already know
something important about this.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,020
The eigenvalues are telling me
something.

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,000
You'll see how it comes out,
but let me point to -- these

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
numbers are -- this eigenvalue,
a negative eigenvalue,

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
is going to disappear.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There's going to be an e to the
minus three t in the answer.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That e to the minus three t as
times goes on is going to be

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
very, very small.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The other part of the answer
will

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
involve an e to the zero t.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But e to the zero t is one and
that's a constant.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So I'm expecting that this
solution'll have two parts,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
an e to the zero t part and an
e to the minus three t part,

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and that -- and as time goes
on, the second part'll disappear

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,140
and the
first part will be a steady

99
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,000
state.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It won't move.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It will be -- at the end of --
as t approaches infinity,

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
this part disappears and this
is the -- the e to the zero t

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
part is what I get.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I'm very interested in
these steady states,

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so that's -- I get a steady
state when I have a zero

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
eigenvalue.
Okay.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What about those eigenvectors?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So what's the eigenvector that
goes with eigenvalue zero?

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,230
Okay.

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,000
The matrix is singular as it
is, the eigenvector is -- is the

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
guy in the null space,
so what vector is in the null

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
space
of that matrix?

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's see.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I guess I probably give the
free variable the value one and

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I realize that if I want to get
zero I need a two up here.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay?
So Ax1 is zero x1.

117
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,000
A x1 is zero x1.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fine.
Okay.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What about the other
eigenvalue?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Lambda two is minus three.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How do I get the other
eigenvalue, then?

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,690
For the moment -- can I
mentally do it?

124
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,000
I subtract minus three along
the diagonal,

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
which means I add three -- can
I -- I'll just do it with an

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
erase -- erase for the moment.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I'm going to add three
to the diagonal.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So this minus one will become a
two and -- I'll make it in big

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
loopy letters -- and when I add
three to this guy,

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the minus two becomes -- well,
I can't make one very loopy,

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
but how's that?

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.
Now that's A minus three I -- A
plus three I,

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
sorry.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's A plus three I.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,100
It's supposed to be singular,
right?

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,000
I-- if things -- if I did it
right, this matrix should be

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
singular and the x2,
the eigenvector should be in

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
its null space.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,200
What do I get for
the null space of this?

141
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Maybe minus one one,
or one minus one.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,890
Doesn't matter.

143
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,000
Those are both perfectly good.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because that's in the null
space of this.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now I'll -- because A times
that vector is three times that

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
vector.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ax2 is minus three
x2.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Good.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.
Can I get A again so we see
that correctly?

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That was a minus one and that
was a minus two.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Good.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.
That -- that's the first job.
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And already the eigenvalues are
telling me the most important

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
information about the answer.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But now, what is the answer?

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The answer is -- the solution
will be U of T -- okay.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now, wh- now I use those
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The solution is some -- there
are two eigenvalues.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So I -- it -- so there're going
to be two special

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
solutions here.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Two pure exponential solutions.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The first one is going to be
either the lambda one tx1 and

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the -- so that solves the
equation, and so does this one.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They both are solutions to the
differential equation.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's the general solution.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The general solution is a
combination of that pure

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
exponential solution and that
pure exponential solution.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can I just see that those guys
do solve the equation?

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,480
So let me just check -- check
on this one, for example.

171
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,000
Check.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I -- I want to check that the
-- my equation -- let's

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
remember,
the equation -- du/dt is Au.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I plug in e to the lambda one t
x1 and let's just see that the

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
equation's okay.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I believe this is a solution to
that equation.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So just plug it in.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
On the left-hand side,
I take the time derivative --

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,250
so the left-hand side will be
lambda

180
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,000
one, e to the lambda one t x1,
right?

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The time derivative -- this is
the term that depends on time,

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it's just ordinary exponential,
its derivative brings down a

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
lambda one.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
On the other side of the
equation it's A times this

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
thing.
A times either the lambda one t
x

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
one, and does that check out?

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do we have equality there?

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, because either the lambda
one t appears on both sides and

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the other one is Ax1 equal
lambda one x1 -- check.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you -- so,
the -- we've come to the first

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
point to remember.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
These pure solutions.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Those pure solutions are the --
those pure exponentials are the

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
differential equations analogue
of -- last time we had pure

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
powers.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Last time -- so -- so last
time, the analog was lambda --

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
lambda one to the K-th power x1,
some amount of that,

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
plus some amount of lambda two
to

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the K-th power x2.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That was our formula from last
time.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I put it up just to -- so your
eye compares those two formulas.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Powers of lambda in the -- in
the difference equation -- that

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
-- this was in the -- this was
for the equation uk plus one

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
equals A uk.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That was for the finite step --
stepping by one.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And we got powers,
now this is the one we're

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
interested in,
the exponentials.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So -- so that's -- that's the
solution -- what are c1 and c2?

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then we're through.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are c1 and c2?

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,460
Well, of course we know these
actual things.

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,000
Let me just -- let me come back
to this.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
c1 is -- we haven't figured out
yet, but e to the lambda one t,

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the lambda one is zero so
that's just a one times x1 which

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,470
is two one.

216
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:42,000
So it's c1 times this one
that's not moving times the

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
vector, the eigenvector two one
and c2 times -- what's e to the

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
lambda two t?

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,960
Lambda two is minus three.

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,000
So this is the term that has
the minus three t and its

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
eigenvector is this one minus
one.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,080
So this vector solves the
equation

223
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,040
and any multiple of it.

224
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,000
This vector solves the equation
if it's got that factor e to the

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
minus three t.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We've got the answer except for
c1 and c2.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So -- so everything I've done
is immediate as soon as you know

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So how do we get c1 and c2?

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That has to come from the
initial condition.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So now I -- now I use -- u of
zero is given as one zero.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So this is the initial
condition that will find c1 and

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,560
c2.

234
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,000
So let me do that on the board
underneath.

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
At t equals zero,
then -- I get c1 times this guy

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
plus c2 and now I'm at times
zero.

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So that's a one and this is a
one minus one and that's

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
supposed to agree with u of zero
one zero.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,020
Okay.

240
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,000
That should be two equations.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That should give me c1 and c2
and then I'm through.

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So what are c1 and
c2?

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's see.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I guess we could actually spot
them by eye or we could solve

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
two equations in two unknowns.

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let's see.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If these were both ones -- so
I'm just adding -- then I would

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
get three zero.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So what's the -- what's the
solution, then?

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If -- if c1 and c2 are both
ones, I get three zero,

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,500
so I want, like,
one third of that,

252
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
because I want to get one zero.

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So I think it's c1 equals a
third, c2 equals a third.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,590
So finally I have the answer.

255
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,000
Let me keep it in the -- in
this board here.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Finally the answer is one third
of

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
this plus one third of this.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you see what -- what's
actually happening with this

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
flow?

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This flow started out at -- the
solution started out at one

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
zero.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Started at one zero.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Then as time went on,
people moved,

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
essentially.

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Some fraction of this
one moved here.

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,100
And -- and in the limit,
there's -- there's the limit,

267
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,000
as -- right?

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
As t goes to infinity,
as t gets very large,

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
this disappears and this is the
steady state.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So the steady state is -- so
the steady state -- u --

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we could call it u at infinity
is one third of two and one.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's -- it's two thirds of one
third.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So that's the -- we really -- I
mean, you're getting,

274
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
like, total,
insight into the behavior of

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,740
the solution,
what the differential

276
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,000
equation does.

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course, we don't -- wouldn't
always have a steady state.

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Sometimes we would approach
zero.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Sometimes we would blow up.

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Can we straighten out those
cases?

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,860
The eigenvalue should tell us.

282
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,000
So when do we get -- so -- so
let me ask first,

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,600
when do we get stability?

284
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
That's u of t going to zero.

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When would the solution go to
zero no matter what the initial

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
condition is?

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Negative eigenvalues,
right.

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Negative eigenvalues.

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But now I have to -- I have to
ask you for one more step.

290
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Suppose the eigenvalues are
complex numbers?

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Because we know they could be.

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then we want stability -- this
-- this -- we want -- we need

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
all these e to the lambda t-s
all going to zero and somehow

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that asks us to have lambda
negative.

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But suppose lambda is a complex
number?

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,230
Then what's the test?

297
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,000
What -- if lambda's a complex
number like, oh,

298
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
suppose lambda is negative plus
an imaginary part?

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Say lambda is minus three plus
six i?

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What -- what happens then?

301
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Can we just,
like, do a -- a case here?

302
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If -- if this lambda is minus
three plus six it,

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
how big is that number?

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Does this -- does this
imaginary part play a -- play a

305
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
-- play a role here or not?

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Or how big is -- what's the
absolute value of that -- of

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that quantity?

308
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's just e to the minus
three t, right?

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Because this other part,
this -- the -- the magnitude --

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the -- this -- e to the six it
-- what -- that has absolute

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
value one.

312
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,740
Right?

313
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,000
That's just this cosine of six
t plus i, sine of six t.

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And the absolute value squared
will be cos squared plus sine

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
squared will be one.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This is -- this complex number
is running around the unit

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,000
circle.
This com- this -- the -- it's
the real part that matters.

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is what I'm trying to do.

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Real part of lambda has to be
negative.

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If lambda's a complex number,
it's the real part,

321
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
the minus three,
that either makes us go to zero

322
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
or doesn't, or let -- or blows
up.

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The imaginary part won't --
will just, like,

324
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
oscillate between the two
components.

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.
So that's stability.

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And what about -- what about a
steady state?

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When would we have,
a steady state,

328
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
always in the same direction?

329
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So let me -- I'll take this
part away -- when -- so that

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
was, like, checking that it's --
that it's the real part that we

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
care about.

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Now, we have a steady state
when -- when lambda one is zero

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and
the other eigenvalues have

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
what?

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,080
So I'm looking -- like,
that example was,

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,000
like, perfect for a steady
state.

337
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We have a zero eigenvalue and
the other eigenvalues,

338
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
we want those to disappear.

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So the other eigenvalues have
real part negative.

340
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And we blow up,
for sure -- we blow up if any

341
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
real part of lambda is positive.

342
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So if I -- if I reverse the
sign of A -- of the matrix A --

343
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,130
suppose instead of the matrix I
had, the A that I had,

344
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,000
I changed it -- I changed all
its sines.

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What would that do to the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If I -- if --
if I know the eigenvalues and

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
eigenvectors of A,
tell me about minus A.

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What happens to the
eigenvalues?

349
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
For minus A,
they'll all change sine.

350
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So I'll have blow up.

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This -- instead of the e to the
minus three t,

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
if I change that to minus --
if I change the sines in that

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
matrix, I would change the trace
to plus three,

354
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I would have an e to the plus
three t and I would have blow

355
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,170
up.

356
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,000
Of course the zero eigenvalue
would stay at zero,

357
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,710
but the other guy is taking off
in -- if I reversed all the

358
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,000
sines.

359
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay.
So this is --
this is the stability picture.

360
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And for a two by two matrix,
we can actually pin down even

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
more closely what that means.

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Can I -- let -- can I do that?

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let me do that -- I want to --
for a two by two matrix,

364
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I can tell whether the real
part of the eigenvalues is

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
negative,
I -- well, let me -- let me

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
tell you what I have in mind for
that.

367
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So two by two stability -- let
me -- this is just a little

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
comment.

369
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,620
Two by two stability.

370
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,000
So my matrix,
now, is just a b c d and I'm

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
looking for the real parts of
both eigenvalues to be negative.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay.

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What -- how can I tell from
looking at the matrix,

374
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
without computing its
eigenvalues, whether the two

375
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
eigenvalues are negative,
or at least their real parts

376
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,350
are negative?

377
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,000
What would that tell me about
the trace?

378
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So -- so the trace --
that's this a plus d -- what

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
can you tell me about the trace
in the case of a two by two

380
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,960
stable matrix?

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,000
That means the eigenvalues have
-- are negative,

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,090
or at least the real parts of
those eigenvalues are negative

383
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,000
-- then, when I take the -- when
I

384
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
look at the matrix and find its
trace, what -- what do I know

385
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
about that?

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's negative,
right.

387
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is the sum of the -- this
equals -- this equals lambda one

388
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,590
plus lambda two,
so it's negative.

389
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,000
The two eigenvalues,
by the way, will have --

390
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,680
if they're complex -- will have
plus six i and minus six i.

391
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,000
The complex parts will -- will
be conjugates of each other and

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
disappear when we add and the
trace will be negative.

393
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay, the trace has to be
negative.

394
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is that enough -- is a negative
trace enough to make the matrix

395
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
stable?

396
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
Shouldn't be enough,
right?

397
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,000
Can I -- can you make -- what's
a matrix that has a negative

398
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
trace but still it's not stable?

399
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So it -- it has a blow -- it
still has a blow-up factor and a

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
-- and a -- and a decaying one.

401
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So what would be a -- so just
-- just to see -- maybe I just

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
put that here.

403
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This -- now I'm looking for an
example where the trace could be

404
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
negative but still blow up.

405
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Of course -- yeah,
let's just take one.

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, look, let me -- let me make
it minus two zero zero one.

407
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay.

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
There's a case where that
matrix has

409
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
negative trace -- I know its
eigenvalues of course.

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
They're minus two and one and
it blows up.

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's got -- it's got a plus one
eigenvalue here,

412
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so there would be an e to the
plus t in the solution and it'll

413
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
blow up if it has any second
component at all.

414
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I need another condition.

415
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And it's a condition on the
determinant.

416
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And what's that condition?

417
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,950
If I know that the two
eigenvalues -- suppose I know

418
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,000
they're negative,
both negative.

419
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What does that tell me about
the determinant?

420
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Let me ask again.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If I know both the eigenvalues
are negative,

422
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
then I know the trace is
negative but the determinant is

423
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
positive, because it's the
product of the two eigenvalues.

424
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So this determinant is lambda
one times lambda two.

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
This is -- this is lambda one
times lambda two and if they're

426
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,400
both negative,
the product is positive.

427
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,000
So positive determinant,
negative trace.

428
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I can easily track down the --
this condition also for the --

429
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
if -- if there's an imaginary
part hanging around.

430
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.
So that's a -- like a small but
quite useful,

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because two by two is always
important -- comment on

432
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
stability.

433
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.
So let's just look at the
picture again.

434
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,900
Okay.

435
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,000
The main part of my lecture,
the one thing you want to be

436
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
able to, like,
just do automatically is this

437
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
step of solving the system.

438
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Find the eigenvalues,
find the eigenvectors,

439
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
find the coefficients.

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And notice --
what's the matrix -- in this

441
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
linear system here,
I can't help -- if I -- if I

442
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
have equations like that --
that's my equations column at a

443
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
time -- what's the matrix form
of that equation?

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So -- so this -- this system of
equations is --

445
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
is some matrix multiplying c1,
c2 to give u of zero.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
One zero.

447
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What's the matrix?

448
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, it's obviously two one,
one minus one,

449
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but we have a name,
or at least a letter --

450
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,570
actually a name for that matrix.

451
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,000
Wh- what matrix are we s- are
we -- are we dealing with here

452
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
in this
step of finding the c-s?

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Its letter is S -- it's the
eigenvector matrix.

454
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Of course.

455
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,850
These are the eigenvectors,
there in the columns of our

456
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,000
matrix.

457
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So this is S c equals u of zero
-- is the -- that step where you

458
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
find the actual coefficients,
you find out how much of each

459
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
pure
exponential is in the solution.

460
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
By getting it right at the
start, then it stays right

461
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,000
forever.
I -- you're seeing this picture
that each -- each pure

462
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
exponential goes on its own way
once you start it from u of

463
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,000
zero.
So you start it by figuring out
how much each one is present in

464
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
u of
zero and then off they go.

465
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

466
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So -- so that's a system of two
equations in two unknowns

467
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
coupled -- the matrix sort of
couples u1 and u2 and the

468
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
eigenvalues and eigenvectors
uncouple it, diagonalize it.

469
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Actually --
okay, now can I -- can I think

470
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
in terms of S and lambda?

471
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So I want to write the solution
down, again in terms of S and

472
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
lambda.

473
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Okay.

474
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll do that on this far board.

475
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Okay.
So I'm coming back to -- I'm
coming back to our equation

476
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
du/dt equals Au.

477
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Now this matrix A couples them.

478
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The whole point of eigenvectors
is to uncouple.

479
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So one way to see that is
introduce set u equal A -- not

480
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,000
A.
It's S, the eigenvector matrix
that uncouples it.

481
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So I'm -- I'm taking this
equation as I'm given,

482
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
coupled with -- with A has --
is probably full of

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
non-zeroes, but I'm -- by
uncoupling it,

484
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I mean I'm diagonalizing it.

485
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If I can get a diagonal matrix,
I'm -- I'm in.

486
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay.

487
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So I plug that in.

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is A S v.

489
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And this is S dv/dt.

490
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
S is a constant.

491
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's -- this it the eigenvector
matrix.

492
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
This is the eigenvector matrix.

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay.

494
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Now I'm going to bring S
inverse over here.

495
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And what have I got?

496
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That combination S inverse A S
is lambda, the diagonal matrix.

497
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That's -- that's the point,
that in -- if I'm using the

498
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
eigenvectors as my basis,
then my system of equations is

499
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
just diagonal.

500
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I -- each -- there's no
coupling anymore -- dv1/dt is

501
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
lambda one v1.

502
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So let's just write that down.
dv1/ dt is lambda one v1 and so

503
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
on for all n of the equations.

504
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's a system of equations but
they're not connected,

505
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so they're easy to solve and
why don't I just write down the

506
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,290
solution?
v -- well, v is now some e to

507
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:55,000
the lambda one t -- well,
okay -- I guess my idea here

508
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
now is to use,
the natural notation --

509
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
v of T is e to the lambda tv of
zero.

510
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And u of t will be Se to the
lambda t S inverse,

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
u of zero.

512
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This is the -- this is the,
formula I'm headed for.

513
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,070
This -- this matrix,
S e to the lambda t S inverse,

514
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,000
that's my exponential.

515
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's my e to the A t,
is this S e to the lambda t S

516
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,210
inverse.

517
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,000
So my -- my job really now is
to explain what's going on with

518
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
this matrix up in the
exponential.

519
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,090
What does that mean?

520
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,000
What does it mean to say e to a
matrix?

521
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This ought to be easier because
this

522
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
is e to a diagonal matrix,
but still it's a matrix.

523
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What do we mean by e to the A
t?

524
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,850
Because really e to the A t is
my answer here.

525
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:22,000
My -- my answer to this
equation is -- this u of t,

526
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
this is my -- this is my e to
the A t u of zero.

527
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So it's -- my job is really now
to

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
say what's -- what does that
mean?

529
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What's the exponential of a
matrix and why is that formula

530
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
correct?

531
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay.

532
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So I'll put that on the board
underneath.

533
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What's the exponential of a
matrix?

534
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Let me come back here.

535
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So I'm talking about matrix
exponentials.

536
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
e to the At.

537
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Okay.
How are we going to define
the exponential of a -- of

538
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
something?

539
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The trick -- the idea is -- the
thing to go back to is

540
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
exponential -- there's a power
series for exponentials.

541
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's how you -- you -- the
good way to define e to

542
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the x is the power series one
plus x plus one half x squared,

543
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,889
one six x cubed and we'll do it
now when the -- when we have a

544
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:35,590
matrix.

545
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,000
So the one becomes the
identity, the x is At,

546
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,699
the x squared is At squared and
I divide by two.

547
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,000
The cube, the x cube is At
cubed over six,

548
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and what's the
general term in here?

549
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
At to the n-th power divided by
-- and it goes on.

550
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But what do I divide by?

551
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So, you see the pattern -- here
I divided by one,

552
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
here I divided by one by two by
six, those are the factorials.

553
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's n factorial.

554
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That was, like,
the one beautiful

555
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,290
Taylor series.

556
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,000
The one beautiful Taylor series
-- well, there are two -- there

557
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
are two beautiful Taylor series
in this world.

558
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The Taylor series for e to the
x is the s with x to the n-th

559
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
over n factorial.

560
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And all I'm doing is doing the
same thing for matrixes.

561
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The other beautiful Taylor
series is just the sum of x to

562
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the n-th not divided by n
factorial.

563
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Can you -- do you know what
function that one is?

564
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,730
So if I take -- this is the
series, all these sums are going

565
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,000
from zero to infinity.

566
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,130
What's -- what function have I
got --

567
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,000
this is like a side comment --
this is one plus x plus x

568
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
squared plus x cubed plus x to
the fourth not divided by

569
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
anything, what's -- what's that
function?

570
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,540
One plus x plus x squared plus
x cubed plus x fourth forever is

571
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,000
one over one minus x.

572
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's the geometric series,
the nicest power series of all.

573
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So, actually,
of course, there would be a

574
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
similar thing here.

575
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
If -- if I wanted,
I minus A t inverse would be --

576
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
now I've got matrixes.

577
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I've got matrixes everywhere,
but it's just like that series

578
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
with -- and just like this one
without the divisions.

579
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's I plus At plus At squared
plus At cubed and forever.

580
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So that's actually a -- a
reasonable way to find the

581
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
inverse of a matrix.

582
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If I chop it off -- well,
it's reasonable if t is small.

583
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If t is a small number,
then -- then t squared is

584
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
extremely small,
t cubed is even smaller,

585
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,600
so approximately that inverse
is I plus At.

586
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I can keep more terms if I
like.

587
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Do you see what I'm doing?

588
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm just saying we can do the
same thing for matrixes that we

589
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
do for ordinary functions and
the good thing about the

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
exponential series -- so in a
way, this series is better than

591
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
this one.

592
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Why?

593
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Because this one always
converges.

594
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm dividing by these bigger
and bigger numbers,

595
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
so whatever matrix A and
however large t is,

596
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
that series -- these terms go
to zero.

597
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The series adds up to a finite
sum,

598
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
e to the At is a -- is -- is
completely defined.

599
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,920
Whereas this second guy could
fail, right?

600
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,000
If At is big -- somehow if At
has an eigenvalue larger than

601
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,520
one, then when I square it it'll
have that eigenvalue squared,

602
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,000
when I cube it the
eigenvalue will be cubed --

603
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that series will blow up unless
the eigenvalues of At are

604
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
smaller than one.

605
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So when the eigenvalues of At
are smaller than one -- so I'd

606
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,250
better put that in.

607
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,000
The -- all eigenvalues of At
below one -- then that series

608
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
converges and gives
me the inverse.

609
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Okay.
So this is the guy I'm chiefly
interested in,

610
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and I wanted to connect it to
-- oh, okay.

611
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,920
What's -- how do I -- how do I
get -- this is my,

612
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,000
like, main thing now to do --
how do I get e to the At --

613
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,580
how do I see that e to the At
is the same as this?

614
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,000
In other words,
I can find e to the At by

615
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
finding S and lambda,
because now e to the lambda t

616
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is easy.
Lambda's a diagonal matrix and
we can write down either the

617
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,000
lambda t -- and will right -- in
a minute.

618
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But how --
do you see what -- do you see

619
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
that we're hoping for a -- we're
hoping that we can compute

620
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
either the A T from S and lambda
-- and I have to look at that

621
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
definition and say,
okay, how do -- how do I get an

622
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
S and the lambda to come out of
that?

623
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay, can -- do you see how I
-- I want to connect that to

624
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that, from that definition.

625
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So let me erase this -- the
geometric series,

626
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
which isn't part of the
differential equations case and

627
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
get the S and the lambda into
this picture.

628
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, okay.

629
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Here we go.

630
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So identity is fine.

631
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Now -- all right,
you -- you -- you'll see how

632
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm -- how I'm -- how I going to
get A replaced by S and S is in

633
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
lambda's?

634
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Well I use the fundamental
formula of this whole chapter.

635
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
A is S lambda S inverse and
then times t.

636
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's At.

637
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay.

638
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
What's A squared t?

639
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I can -- I've got the divide by
two, I've got the t squared and

640
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I've got an A squared.

641
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
All right, I -- so I've got a
-- there's A -- there's A.

642
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Now square it.

643
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So what happens when I square
it?

644
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We've seen that before.

645
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
When I square it,
I get S lambda squared S

646
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
inverse, right?

647
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
When I square that thing,
the -- there's an S and a -- an

648
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,340
S cancels out an S inverse.

649
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm left with the S on the
left, the S inverse on the right

650
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and lambda squared in the
middle.

651
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And so on.

652
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The next one'll be S lambda
cubed, S inverse -- times t

653
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
cubed over three factorial.

654
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,630
And now -- what do I do now?

655
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,000
I want to pull an S out from
everything.

656
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I want an S out of the whole
thing.

657
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, look, I'd better write
the identity how?

658
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I -- I want to be able to pull
an S

659
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,990
out and an S inverse out from
the other side,

660
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,000
so I just write the identity as
S times S inverse.

661
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So I have an S there and an S
inverse from this side and what

662
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
have I got in the middle?

663
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
If I pull out an S and an S
inverse, what have I got in the

664
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
middle?

665
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I've got the identity,
a lambda t, a lambda squared t

666
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
squared over two -- I've got e
to the lambda t.

667
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That's what's in the middle.

668
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
That's my formula for e to the
At.

669
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh, now I have to ask you.

670
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,910
Does this formula always work?

671
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:50,000
This formula always works --
well, except it's an infinite

672
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
series.

673
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But what do I mean by always
work?

674
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And this one doesn't always
work and I just have to remind

675
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
you of what assumption is built
into this formula that's not

676
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
built into the original.

677
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The assumption that A can be
diagonalized.

678
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You'll remember that there are
some small -- sm- some subset of

679
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
matrixes that don't have n
independent eigenvectors,

680
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
so we don't have an S inverse
for those matrixes and the whole

681
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
diagonalization breaks down.

682
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
We could still make it
triangular.

683
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'll tell you about that.

684
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But diagonal we can't do for
those particular degenerate

685
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
matrixes that don't have enough
independent eigenvectors.

686
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But otherwise,
this is golden.

687
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,130
Okay.

688
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,000
So that's the formula -- that's
the matrix exponential.

689
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Now it just remains for me to
say what is e to the lambda t?

690
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Can I just do that?

691
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Let me just put that in the
corner here.

692
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What is the exponential of a
diagonal matrix?

693
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Remember lambda is diagonal,
lambda one down to lambda n.

694
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
What's the exponential of that
diagonal matrix?

695
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Because our whole point is that
this ought to be simple.

696
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,390
Our whole point is that to take
the exponential of a diagonal

697
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:31,000
matrix ought to be completely
decoupled --

698
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it ought to be diagonal,
in other words,

699
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,880
and it is.

700
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,000
It's just e to the lambda one
t, e to the lambda two t,

701
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
e to the lambda n t,
all zeroes.

702
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So -- so if we have a diagonal
matrix and I plug it into this

703
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
exponential formula,
everything's diagonal and the

704
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
diagonal terms are just the
ordinary

705
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,890
scaler exponentials e to the
lambda one t.

706
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,000
Okay, so that's -- that's -- in
a sense, I'm doing here,

707
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
on this board,
with -- with,

708
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
like, formulas what I did on
the -- in the first half of the

709
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
lecture with specific matrix A
and specific

710
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

711
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The -- so let me show you the
formulas again.

712
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But the -- so you -- I guess --
what should you know from this

713
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,000
lecture?
You should know what this
matrix exponential is and,

714
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
like, when does it go to zero?

715
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Tell me again,
now,

716
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the answer to that.

717
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
When does e to the At approach
-- get smaller and smaller as t

718
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
increases?

719
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, the S and the S inverse
aren't moving.

720
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's this one that has to get
smaller and smaller and that one

721
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
has this simple diagonal form.

722
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,960
And it goes to zero provided
every

723
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,000
one of these lambdas -- I -- I
need to have each one of these

724
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
guys go to zero,
so I need every real part of

725
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
every eigenvalue negative.

726
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Right?

727
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
If the real part is negative,
that's -- that takes the

728
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
exponential -- that forces --
the exponential goes to zero.

729
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay, so that -- that's
really the difference.

730
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
If I can just draw the --
here's a picture of the -- of

731
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the -- this is the complex
plain.

732
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,220
Here's the real axis and here's
the imaginary axis.

733
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,650
And where do the eigenvalues
have to be for stability in

734
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,000
differential equations?

735
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They have to be over here,
in the left half plain.

736
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So the left half plain is this
plain, real part of lambda,

737
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,480
less than zero.

738
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,000
Where do the ma- where do the
eigenvalues have to be for

739
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
powers of the matrix to go to
zero?

740
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Powers of the matrix go to zero
if the eigenvalues are in here.

741
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,290
So this is the stability region
for powers -- this is the region

742
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,000
--
absolute value of lambda,

743
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
less than one.

744
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's the stability for --
that tells us that the powers of

745
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A go to zero,
this tells us that the

746
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
exponential of A goes to zero.

747
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Okay.

748
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
One final example.

749
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Let me just write down how to
deal with a final example.

750
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Let's see.

751
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So my final example will be a
single equation,

752
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
u''+bu'+Ku=0.

753
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
One equation,
second order.

754
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
How do I -- and maybe I should
have used -- I'll use -- I

755
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
prefer to use y here,
because that's what you see in

756
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
differential equations.

757
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,130
And I want u to be a vector.

758
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:27,000
So how do I change one second
order equation into a two by two

759
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
first order system?

760
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Just the way I did for
Fibonacci.

761
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'll let u be y prime and y.

762
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to add an extra equation,

763
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
y prime equals y prime.

764
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So I take this -- so by -- so
using this as the vector

765
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,670
unknown, now my equation is u
prime.

766
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:04,000
My first order system is u
prime, that'll be y double prime

767
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
y prime, the derivative of u,
okay, now the differential

768
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
equation is telling me that y
double prime is m- so I'm just

769
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
looking for -- what's this
matrix?

770
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,390
y prime y.

771
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm looking for the matrix A.

772
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,400
What's the matrix in case I
have a single first order

773
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,000
equation and I want to make it
into a two by two system?

774
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Okay, simple.

775
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The first row of the matrix is
given by the equation.

776
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So y''-by'-ky
-- no problem.

777
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And what's the second row on
the matrix?

778
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Then we're done.

779
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The second row of the matrix I
want just to be the trivial

780
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,480
equation y prime equals y prime,
so I need a one and a zero

781
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,000
there.

782
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So matrixes like these,
the gen- the general case,

783
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,000
if I had a five by five --
if I had a fifth order equation

784
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and I wanted a five by five
matrix, I would see the

785
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,780
coefficients of the equation up
there and then my four trivial

786
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,000
equations would put ones here.

787
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,700
This is the kind of matrix that
goes from a fifth order to a

788
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,000
five by five first order.

789
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So the -- and the eigenvalues
will

790
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
come out in a natural way
connected to the differential

791
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,000
equation.
Okay, that's differential
equations.

792
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:56,000
The -- a parallel lecture
compared to powers of a matrix

793
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
we can now do exponentials.

794
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Thanks.
