1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
OK.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good.
The final class in linear
algebra at MIT this Fall is to

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
review the whole course.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And, you know the best way I
know how to review is to take

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
old exams and just think through
the problems.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So it will be a three-hour exam
next Thursday.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nobody will be able to take an
exam before Thursday,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
anybody who needs to take it in
some different way after

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thursday should see me next
Monday.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll be in my office Monday.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,830
OK.

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,000
May I just read out some
problems and,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
let me bring the board down,
and let's start.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,430
OK.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,000
Here's a question.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is about a 3-by-n matrix.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And we're given -- so we're
given -- given -- A x equals 1 0

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
0 has no solution.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And we're also given A x equals
0 1 0 has exactly one solution.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
OK.
So you can probably anticipate
my first question,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
what can you tell me about m?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's an m-by-n matrix of rank
r, as always,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
what can you tell me about
those three numbers?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So what can you tell me about
m, the number of rows,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
n, the number of columns,
and r, the rank?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
OK.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
See, do you want to tell me
first what m is?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How many rows in this matrix?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Must be three,
right?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We can't tell what n is,
but we can certainly tell that

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
m is three.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
OK.

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,000
And, what do these things tell
us?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's take them one at a time.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
When I discover that some
equation has no solution,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
that there's some right-hand
side with no answer,

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,680
what does that tell me about
the rank of the matrix?

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
It's smaller m.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that right?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,780
If there is no solution,
that tells me that some rows of

41
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,000
the matrix are combinations of
other rows.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because if I had a pivot in
every row, then I would

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
certainly be able to solve the
system.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,140
I would have particular
solutions and all the good

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,000
stuff.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So any time that there's a
system with no solutions,

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that tells me that r must be
below m.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What about the fact that if,
when there is a solution,

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
there's only one?

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What does that tell me?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,930
Well, normally there would be
one solution,

52
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,000
and then we could add in
anything in the null space.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So this is telling me the null
space only has the 0 vector in

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it.
There's just one solution,
period, so what does that tell

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
me?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The null space has only the
zero vector in it?

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What does that tell me about
the relation of r to n?

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So this one solution only,
that means the null space of

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,170
the matrix must be just the zero
vector, and what does that tell

60
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,000
me about r and n?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They're equal.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The columns are independent.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I've got,
now, r equals n,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and r less than m,
and now I also know m is three.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So those are really the facts I
know.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
n=r and those numbers are
smaller than three.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sorry, yes, yes.
r is smaller than m,

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and n, of course,
is also.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I guess this summarizes what
we can tell.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In fact, why not give me a
matrix -- because I would often

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ask for an example of such a
matrix -- can you give me a

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
matrix A that's an example?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That shows this possibility?

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Exactly, that there's no
solution with that right-hand

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
side, but there's exactly one
solution with this right-hand

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,490
side.

77
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,000
Anybody want to suggest a
matrix that does that?

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,140
Let's see.

79
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,000
What do I -- what vector do I
want in the column space?

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want zero,
one, zero, to be in the column

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
space, because I'm able to solve
for that.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So let's put zero,
one, zero in the column space.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Actually, I could stop right
there.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That would be a matrix with m
equal three, three rows,

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and n and r are both one,
rank one, one column,

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and, of course,
there's no solution to that

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
one.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that's perfectly good as it
is.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or if you, kind of,
have a prejudice against

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
matrices that only have one
column, I'll accept a second

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
column.
So what could I include as a
second column that would just be

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
a different answer but equally
good?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,980
I could put this vector in the
column space,

94
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,290
too, if I wanted.

95
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,000
That would now be a case with
r=n=2, but, of course,

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
three m eq- m is still three,
and this vector is not in the

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
column space.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you're -- this is just like
prompting us to remember all

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
those things,
column space,

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
null space, all that stuff.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, I probably asked a second
question about this type of

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,150
thing.

103
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,000
Ah.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
OK.
Oh, I even asked,
write down an example of a

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
matrix that fits the
description.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hm.
I guess I haven't learned
anything in twenty-six years.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
CK.

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Cross out all statements that
are false about any matrix with

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
these -- so again,
these are -- this is the

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
preliminary sta- these are the
facts about my matrix,

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
this is one example.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But, of course,
by having an example,

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,200
it will be easy to check some
of these facts,

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
or non-facts.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let me, let me write down some,
facts.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Some possible facts.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So this is really true or
false.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,240
The determinant -- this is part
one, the determinant of A

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:57,000
transpose A is the same as the
determinant of A A transpose.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is that true or not?

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Second one, A transpose A,
is invertible.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,850
Is invertible.

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,240
Third possible fact,
A A transpose is positive

124
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,000
definite.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So you see how,
on an exam question,

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I try to connect the different
parts of the course.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, well, I mean,
the simplest way would be to

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,510
try it with that matrix as a
good example,

129
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,000
but maybe we can answer,
even directly.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let me take number two first.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because I'm -- you know,
I'm very, very fond of that

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
matrix, A transpose A.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,910
And when is it invertible?

134
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,000
When is the matrix A transpose
A, invertible?

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,130
The great thing is that I can
tell from the rank of A that I

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,000
don't have to multiply out A
transpose A.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A transpose A,
is invertible -- well,

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if A has a null space other
than the zero vector,

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
then it -- it's -- no way it's
going to be invertible.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But the beauty is,
if the null space of A is just

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the zero vector,
so the fact -- the key fact is,

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
this is invertible if r=n,
by which I mean,

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
independent columns of A.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
In A.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,180
In the matrix A.

146
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,470
If r=n -- if the matrix A has
independent columns,

147
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,000
then this combination,
A transpose A,

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
is square and still that same
null space, only the zero

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
vector, independent columns all
good, and so,

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
what's the true/false?

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is it -- is this middle one T
or F for this,

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
in this setup?

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, we discovered that -- we
discovered that -- that r was n,

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
from that second fact.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So this is a true.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's a true.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And, of course,
A transpose A,

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
in this example,
would probably be -- what would

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A transpose A,
be, for that matrix?

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,460
Can you multiply A transpose A,
and see what it looks like for

161
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,000
that matrix?

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,830
What shape would it be?

163
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,000
It will be two by two.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And what matrix will it be?

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The identity.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, it checks out.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OK, what about A A transpose?

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, depending on the shape of
A, it could be good or not so

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
good.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's always symmetric,
it's always square,

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but what's the size,
now?

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is three by n,
and this is n by three,

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so the result is three by
three.

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it positive definite?

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't think so.

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
False.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,200
If I multiply that by A
transpose, A A transpose,

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
what would the rank be?

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It would be the same as the
rank of A, that's -- it would be

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
just rank two.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And if it's three-by-three,
and it's only rank two,

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it's certainly not positive
definite.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So what could I say about A A
transpose, if I wanted to,

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
like, say something true about
it?

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's true that it is positive
semi-definite.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If I made this semi-definite,
it would always be true,

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
always.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But if I'm looking for positive
definite, then I'm looking at

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the null space of whatever's
here, and, in this case,

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,330
it's got a null space.

191
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,000
So A, A -- eh,
shall we just figure it out,

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
here?
A A transpose,
for that matrix,

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
will be three-by-three.

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,950
If I multiplied A by A
transpose, what would the first

195
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,000
row be?

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
All zeroes, right?

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
First row of A A transpose,
could only be all zeroes,

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
so it's probably a one there
and a one there,

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
or something like that.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But, I don't even know if
that's right.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But it's all zeroes there,
so it's certainly not positive

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
definite.

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,160
Let me not put anything up I'm
not sh- don't check.

204
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,000
What about this determinant?

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, well, I guess -- that's a
sort of tricky question.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,910
Is it true or false in this
case?

207
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,000
It's false, apparently,
because A transpose A,

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is invertible,
we just got a true for this

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
one, and we got a false,
we got a z- we got a

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,980
non-invertible one for this one.

211
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,000
So actually,
this one is false,

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
number one.

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That surprises us,
actually, because it's,

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,020
I mean, why was it tricky?

215
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,000
Because what is true about
determinants?

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This would be true if those
matrices were square.

217
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If I have two square matrices,
A and any other matrix B,

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
could be A transpose,
could be somebody else's

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
matrix.

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then it would be true that the
determinant of B A would equal

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the determinant of A B.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But if the matrices are not
square and it would actually be

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
true that it would be equal --
that this would equal the

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
determinant of A times the
determinant of A transpose.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We could even split up those
two separate determinants.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,770
And, of course,
those would be equal.

227
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,920
But only when A is square.

228
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,000
So that's just,
that's a question that rests on

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the, the falseness rests on the
fact that the matrix isn't

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
square in the first place.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
OK, good.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's see.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, now, even asks more.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Prove that A transpose y equals
c -- hah-God,

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it's -- this question goes on
and on.

236
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
now I ask you about A transpose
y=c.

237
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I'm asking you about the
equation -- about the matrix A

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,020
transpose.

239
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:54,000
And I want you to prove that it
has at least one solution -- one

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
solution for every c,
every right-hand side c,

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and, in fact -- in fact,
infinitely many solutions for

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
every c.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,460
OK.

244
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, none -- none of this is
difficult, but,

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it's been a little while.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So we just have to think again.

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
When I have a system of
equations -- this is -- this

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
matrix A transpose is now,
instead of being three by n,

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
it's n by three,
it's n by m.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Of course.

251
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
To show that a system has at
least one solution,

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
when does this,
when does this system -- when

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is the system always solvable?

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When it has full row rank,
when the rows are independent.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Here, we have n rows,
and that's the rank.

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So at least one solution,
because the number of rows,

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
which is n, for the transpose,
is equal to r,

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the rank.

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This A transpose had
independent rows because A had

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
independent columns,
right?

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The original A had independent
columns, when we transpose it,

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
it has independent rows,
so there's at least one

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
solution.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But now, how do I even know
that there are infinitely many

265
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
solutions?

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, what do I -- I want to know
something about the null space.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,340
What's the dimension of the
null space of A transpose?

268
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,000
So the answer has got to be the
dimension of the null space of A

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,280
transpose, what's the general
fact?

270
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,000
If A is an m by n matrix of
rank r, what's the dimension of

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
A transpose?

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The null space of A transpose?

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you remember that little
fourth subspace that's tagging

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
along down in our big picture?

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's dimension was m-r.

276
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And, that's bigger than zero.
m is bigger than r.

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So there's a lot in that null
space.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So there's always one solution
because n i- this is speaking

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
about A transpose.

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So for A transpose,
the roles of m and n are

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
reversed, of course,
so I'm -- keep in mind that

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
this board was about A
transpose, so the roles -- so

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
it's the null space of a
transpose, and there are m-r

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
free variables.

285
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OK, that's, like,
just some, review.

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Can I take another problem
that's also sort of

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
-- suppose the matrix A has
three columns,

288
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,430
v1, v2, v3.

289
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:35,000
Those are the columns of the
matrix.

290
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
All right.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Question A.

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Solve Ax=v1-v2+v3.

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Tell me what x is.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, there,
you're seeing the most

295
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
-- the one absolutely essential
fact about matrix

296
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
multiplication,
how does it work,

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
when we do it a column at a
time, the very,

298
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,690
very first day,
way back in September,

299
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,000
we did multiplication a column
at a time.

300
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So what's x?

301
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Just tell me?

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One minus one,
one.

303
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Thanks.

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,000
OK.
Everybody's got that.

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,000
OK?
Then the next question is,
suppose that combination is

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
zero -- oh, yes,
OK, so question (b) says --

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
part (b) says,
suppose this thing is zero.

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Suppose that's zero.

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Then the solution is not
unique.

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Suppose I want true or false.
-- and a reason.

311
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Suppose this combination is
zero.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
v1-v2+v3.

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Show that -- what does that
tell me?

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So it's a separate question,
maybe I sort of saved time by

315
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
writing it that way,
but it's a totally separate

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
question.

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If I have a matrix,
and I know that column one

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
minus column two plus column
three is zero,

319
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
what does that tell me about
whether the solution is unique

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
or not?

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,940
Is there more than one
solution?

322
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,000
What's uniqueness about?

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Uniqueness is about,
is there anything in the null

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
space, right?

325
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,000
The solution is unique when
there's nobody in the null space

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
except the zero vector.

327
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And, if that's zero,
then this guy would be in the

328
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
null space.

329
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So if this were zero,
then this x is in the null

330
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
space of A.

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So solutions are never unique,
because I could always add that

332
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
to any solution,
and Ax wouldn't change.

333
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So it's always that question.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Is there somebody in the null
space?

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OK.

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, now, here's a totally
different question.

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Suppose those three vectors,
v1, v2, v3, are orthonormal.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So this isn't going to happen
for orthonormal vectors.

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
OK, so part (c),
forget part (b).

340
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,000
c.
If v1, v2, v3,
are orthonormal -- so that I

341
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,000
would usually have called them
q1, q2, q3.

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Now, what combination -- oh,
here's a nice question,

343
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
if I say so myself -- what
combination of v1 and v2 is

344
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
closest to v3?

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What point on the plane of v1
and v2 is the closest point to

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
v3 if these vectors are
orthonormal?

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So let me -- I'll start the
sentence -- then the combination

348
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
something times v1 plus
something times v2 is the

349
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
closest combination to v3?

350
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And what's the answer?

351
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,750
What's the closest vector on
that plane to v3?

352
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,000
Zeroes.

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right.

354
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We just imagine the x,
y, z axes, the v1,

355
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,170
v2, th- v3 could be the
standard basis,

356
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,000
the x, y, z vectors,
and, of course,

357
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the point on the xy plane
that's closest to v3 on the z

358
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
axis is zero.

359
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So if we're orthonormal,
then the projection of v3 onto

360
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that plane is perpendicular,
it hits right at zero.

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
OK, so that's like a quick --
you know, an easy question,

362
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
but still brings it out.

363
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OK.

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let me see what,
shall I write down a Markov

365
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
matrix, and I'll ask you for its
eigenvalues.

366
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
OK.

367
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Here's a Markov matrix -- this
-- and, tell me its eigenvalues.

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So here -- I'll call the matrix
A, and I'll call this as point

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
two, point four,
point four, point four,

370
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
point four, point two,
point four, point three,

371
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
point three,
point four.

372
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
OK.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,990
Let's see -- it helps out to
notice that column one plus

374
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,000
column two
-- what's interesting about

375
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
column one plus column two?

376
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's twice as much as column
three.

377
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So column one plus column two
equals two times column three.

378
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I put that in there,
column one plus column two

379
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
equals twice column three.

380
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's observation.

381
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
OK.
Tell me the eigenvalues of the
matrix.

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OK, tell me one eigenvalue?

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:25:06,930


384
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,000
Because the matrix is singular.

385
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Tell me another eigenvalue?

386
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
One, because it's a Markov
matrix, the columns add to the

387
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
all ones vector,
and that will be an eigenvector

388
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
of A transpose.

389
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And tell me the third
eigenvalue?

390
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's see, to make the trace
come out right,

391
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
which is point eight,
we need minus point two.

392
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
OK.

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And now, suppose I start the
Markov process.

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Suppose I start with u(0) -- so
I'm going to look at the powers

395
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
of A applied to u(0).

396
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is uk.

397
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And there's my matrix,
and I'm going to let u(0) be --

398
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
this is going to be zero,
ten, zero.

399
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And my question is,
what does that approach?

400
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If u(0) is equal to this --
there is u(0).

401
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Shall I write it in?

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Maybe I'll just write in u(0).

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
A to the k, starting with ten
people in state two,

404
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and every step follows the
Markov rule, what does the

405
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
solution look like after k
steps?

406
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Let me just ask you that.

407
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,850
And then, what happens as k
goes to infinity?

408
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,000
This is a steady-state
question, right?

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm looking for the steady
state.

410
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,000
Actually, the question doesn't
ask for the k step answer,

411
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
it just jumps right away to
infinity -- but how would I

412
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
express the solution after k
steps?

413
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It would be some multiple of
the first eigenvalue to the k-th

414
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
power -- times the first
eigenvector, plus some other

415
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
multiple of the second
eigenvalue, times its

416
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
eigenvector, and some multiple
of the third eigenvalue,

417
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
times its eigenvector.

418
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
OK.

419
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Good.
And these eigenvalues are zero,
one, and minus point two.

420
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So what happens as k goes to
infinity?

421
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The only thing that survives
the steady state -- so at u

422
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
infinity, this is gone,
this is gone,

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
all that's left is c2x2.

424
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So I'd better find x2.

425
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I've got to find that
eigenvector to complete the

426
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
answer.

427
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What's the eigenvector that
corresponds to lambda equal one?

428
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's the key eigenvector in
any Markov process,

429
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
is that eigenvector.

430
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Lambda equal one is an
eigenvalue, I need its

431
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
eigenvector x2,
and then I need to know how

432
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
much of it is in the starting
vector u0.

433
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,600
OK.

434
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,000
So, how do I find that
eigenvector?

435
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,860
I guess I subtract one from the
diagonal, right?

436
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,000
So I have minus point eight,
minus point eight,

437
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
minus point six,
and the rest,

438
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
of course, is just
-- still point four,

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
point four, point four,
point four, point three,

440
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
point three,
and hopefully,

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that's a singular matrix,
so I'm looking to solve A minus

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Ix equal zero.

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Let's see -- can anybody spot
the solution here?

444
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't know,
I didn't make it easy for

445
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
myself.

446
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What do you think there?

447
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe those first two entries
might be -- oh,

448
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
no, what do you think?

449
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Anybody see it?

450
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We could use elimination if we
were desperate.

451
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Are we that desperate?

452
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Anybody just call out if you
see the vector that's in that

453
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,410
null space.

454
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,000
Eh, there better be a vector in
that null space,

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
or I'm quitting.

456
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Uh, ha- OK, well,
I guess we could use

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
elimination.

458
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I thought maybe somebody might
see it from further away.

459
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Is there a chance that these
guys are -- could it be that

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
these two are equal and this is
whatever it takes,

461
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
like, something like three,
three, two?

462
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Would that possibly work?

463
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I mean, that's great for this
-- no, it's not that great.

464
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Three, three,
four -- this is,

465
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
deeper mathematics you're
watching now.

466
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Three, three,
four, is that -- it works!

467
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't mess with it!

468
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It works!

469
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Uh, yes.

470
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
OK, it works,
all right.

471
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And, yes, OK,
and, so that's x2,

472
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
three, three,
four, and, how much of that

473
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
vector is in the starting
vector?

474
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Well, we could go through a
complicated process.

475
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But what's the beauty of Markov
things?

476
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That the total number of the
total population,

477
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the sum of these doesn't
change.

478
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That the total number of
people, they're moving around,

479
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
but they don't get born or die
or get dead.

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So there's ten of them at the
start, so there's ten of them

481
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,350
there, so c2 is actually one,
yes.

482
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,000
So that would be the correct
solution.

483
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,000
OK.
That would be the u infinity.

484
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
OK.

485
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So I used there,
in that process,

486
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
sort of, the main facts about
Markov matrices to,

487
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to get a jump on the answer.

488
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
OK.
let's see.

489
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
OK, here's some,
kind of quick,

490
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
short questions.

491
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Uh, maybe I'll move over to
this board, and leave that for

492
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the moment.
I'm looking for two-by-two
matrices.

493
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And I'll read out the property
I want, and you give me an

494
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
example, or tell me there isn't
such a matrix.

495
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
All right.

496
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Here we go.

497
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
First -- so two-by-twos.

498
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:37,000
First, I want the projection
onto the line through A equals

499
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
four minus three.

500
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So it's a one-dimensional
projection matrix I'm looking

501
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
for.

502
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And what's the formula for it?

503
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What's the formula for the
projection matrix P onto a line

504
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,000
through A.
And then we'd just plug in this
particular A.

505
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Do you remember that formula?

506
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
There's an A and an A
transpose, and normally we would

507
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
have an A transpose A inverse in
the middle, but here we've just

508
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
got numbers, so we just divide
by it.

509
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,090
And then plug in A and we've
got it.

510
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,000
OK.

511
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So, equals.

512
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You can put in the numbers.

513
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Trivial, right.

514
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,000
OK.
Number two.

515
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So this is a new problem.

516
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The matrix with eigenvalue zero
and three and eigenvectors --

517
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
well, let me write these down.
eigenvalue zero,

518
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
eigenvector one,
two, eigenvalue three,

519
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
eigenvector two,
one.

520
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm giving you the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors instead of

521
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
asking for them.

522
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Now I'm asking for the matrix.

523
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What's the matrix,
then?

524
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What's A?

525
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Here was a formula,
then we just put in some

526
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
numbers, what's the formula
here, into which we'll just put

527
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
the given numbers?

528
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's the S lambda S inverse,
right?

529
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,570
So it's S, which is this
eigenvector matrix,

530
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,000
it's the lambda,
which is the eigenvalue matrix,

531
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
it's the S inverse,
whatever that turns out to be,

532
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
let me just leave it as
inverse.

533
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That has to be it,
right?

534
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because if we went in the other
direction, that matrix S would

535
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
diagonalize A to produce lambda.

536
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So it's S lambda S inverse.

537
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Good.
OK, ready for number three.

538
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
A real matrix that cannot be
factored into A -- I'm looking

539
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
for a matrix A that never could
equal B transpose B,

540
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,060
for any B.

541
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:22,000
A two-by-two matrix that could
not be factored in the form B

542
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
transpose B.

543
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So all you have to do is think,
well, what does B transpose B,

544
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
look like, and then pick
something different.

545
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What do you suggest?

546
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's see.

547
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
What shall we take for a matrix
that could not have this form,

548
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
B transpose B.

549
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Well, what do we know about B
transpose B?

550
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's always symmetric.

551
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So just give me any
non-symmetric matrix,

552
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
it couldn't possibly have that
form.

553
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
OK.

554
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And let me ask the fourth part
of this question -- a matrix

555
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that has orthogonal
eigenvectors,

556
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but it's not symmetric.

557
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
What matrices have orthogonal
eigenvectors,

558
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
but they're not symmetric
matrices?

559
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:27,000
What other families of matrices
have orthogonal eigenvectors?

560
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We know symmetric matrices do,
but others, also.

561
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So I'm looking for orthogonal
eigenvectors,

562
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and, what do you suggest?

563
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The matrix could be
skew-symmetric.

564
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It could be an orthogonal
matrix.

565
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,670
It could be symmetric,
but that was too easy,

566
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,000
so I ruled that out.

567
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It could be skew-symmetric like
one minus one,

568
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
like that.

569
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Or it could be an orthogonal
matrix like cosine sine,

570
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
minus sine, cosine.

571
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:27,000
All those matrices would have
complex orthogonal eigenvectors.

572
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But they would be orthogonal,
and so those examples are fine.

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,000
OK.
We can continue a little longer
if you would like to,

574
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
with these -- from this exam.

575
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
From these exams.

576
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Least squares?

577
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
OK, here's a least squares
problem in which,

578
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
to make life quick,
I've given the answer -- it's

579
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
like Jeopardy!,
right?

580
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I just give the answer,
and you give the question.

581
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
OK.
Whoops, sorry.

582
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Let's see, can I stay over here
for the next question?

583
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,440
OK.
least squares.

584
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,000
So I'm giving you the problem,
one, one, one,

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
zero, one, two,
c d equals three,

586
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
four, one, and that's b,
of course, this is Ax=b.

587
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And the least squares solution
--

588
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Maybe I put c hat d hat to
emphasize it's not the true

589
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
solution.

590
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So the least square solution --
the hats really go here -- is

591
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
eleven-thirds and minus one.

592
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Of course, you could have
figured that out in no time.

593
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So this year,
I'll ask you to do it,

594
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
probably.

595
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But, suppose we're given the
answer, then let's just remember

596
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
what happened.

597
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
OK, good question.

598
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
What's the projection P of this
vector onto the column space of

599
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that matrix?

600
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,170
So I'll write that question
down, one.

601
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,000
What is P?

602
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The projection.

603
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The projection of b onto the
column space of A is what?

604
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Hopefully, that's what the
least squares problem solved.

605
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What is it?

606
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This was the best solution,
it's eleven-thirds times column

607
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
one, plus -- or rather,
minus one times column two.

608
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Right?

609
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's what least squares did.

610
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It found the combination of the
columns that was as close as

611
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
possible to b.

612
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's what least squares was
doing.

613
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It found the projection.

614
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
OK?

615
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Secondly, draw the straight
line problem that corresponds to

616
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,000
this system.
So I guess that the straight
line fitting a straight line

617
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
problem, we kind of recognize.

618
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So we recognize,
these are the heights,

619
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and these are the points,
and so at zero,

620
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
one, two, the heights are
three, and at t equal to one,

621
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the height is four,
one, two, three,

622
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
four, and at t equal to two,
the height is one.

623
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So I'm trying to fit the best
straight line through those

624
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
points.

625
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,720
God.

626
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,000
I could fit a triangle very
well, but, I don't even know

627
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,000
which way the best straight line
goes.

628
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, I do know how it goes,
because there's the answer,yes.

629
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It has a height eleven-thirds,
and it has slope minus one,

630
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,170
so it's something like that.

631
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:26,000
OK.

632
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,210
Great.

633
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:33,450
Now, finally -- and this
completes the course -- find a

634
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,380
different vector b,
not all zeroes,

635
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:43,000
for which the least square
solution would be zero.

636
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So I want you to find a
different B so that the least

637
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
square solution changes to all
zeroes.

638
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So tell me what I'm really
looking for here.

639
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm looking for a b where the
best combination of these two

640
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
columns is the zero combination.

641
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So what kind of a vector b I
looking for?

642
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm looking for a vector b
that's orthogonal to those

643
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
columns.

644
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's orthogonal to those
columns, it's orthogonal to the

645
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
column space,
the best possible answer is

646
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,000
zero.
So a vector b that's orthogonal
to those columns -- let's see,

647
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
maybe one of those minus two of
those, and one of those?

648
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That would be orthogonal to
those columns,

649
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and the best vector would be
zero, zero.

650
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
OK.

651
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So that's as many questions as
I can do in an hour,

652
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
but you get three hours,
and, let me just say,

653
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
as I've said by e-mail,
thanks very much for your

654
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,380
patience as this series of
lectures was videotaped,

655
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,000
and, thanks for filling out
these forms, maybe just leave

656
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,800
them on the table up there as
you go out

657
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,000
-- and above all,
thanks for taking the course.

658
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Thank you.

659
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Thanks.
