1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
OK, here's linear algebra
lecture seven.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I've been talking about vector
spaces and specially the null

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
space of a matrix and the column
space of a matrix.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What's in those spaces.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now I want to actually describe
them.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How do you describe all the
vectors that are in those

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
spaces?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How do you compute these
things?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So this is the,
turning the idea,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the definition,
into an algorithm.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's the algorithm for
solving A x =0?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So that's the null space that
I'm interested in.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So can I take a particular
matrix A and describe the

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
natural algorithm,
and I'll execute it for that

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
matrix -- here we go.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So let me take the matrix as an
example.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we're definitely talking
rectangular matrices in this

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
chapter.
So I'll make,
I'll have four columns.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And three rows.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Two four six eight and three
six eight ten.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
OK.
If I just look at those
columns, and rows,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
well, I notice right away that
column two is a multiple of

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,090
column one.

24
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,000
It's in the same direction as
column one.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,030
It's not independent.

26
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll expect to discover that in
the process.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually, with rows,
I notice that that row plus

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
this row gives the third row.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,820
So the third row is not
independent.

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,000
So, all that should come out of
elimination.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So now what I --
my algorithm is elimination,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but extended now to the
rectangular case,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
where we have to continue even
if there's zeros in the pivot

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
position, we go on.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OK, so let me execute
elimination for that matrix.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My goal is always,
while I'm doing elimination --

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not changing the null
space.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's very important,
right?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm solving A x equals zero by
elimination, and when I do these

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
operations that you already
know, when I subtract a multiple

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,690
of one equation from another
equation, I'm not changing the

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,000
solutions.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm not changing the null
space.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Actually, I changing the column
space, as you'll see.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you have to pay attention.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What does elimination leave
unchanged?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,550
And the answer is the solutions
to the system are not changed

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,450
because I'm doing the same thing
to -- I'm doing a legitimate

49
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,000
operations on the equations.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Of course, on the right hand
side it's always zero,

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and I don't plan to write zero
all the time.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,650
OK, so I'm really just working
on the left side,

53
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,000
but the right side is,
is keeping up always zeros.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
OK, so what's elimination?

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, you know where the first
pivot is and you know what to do

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
with it.
So can I just take the first
step below here?

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So that pivot row is fine.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I take two times that row away
from this one and I get zero

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
zero.
That's signaling a difficulty.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Two, two twos away from the six
leaves me with a two.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Two twos away from the eight
leaves me with a four.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And now three of those away
from here is zero,

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
again another zero,
three twos away from that eight

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is the two, three twos away from
that ten is a four.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OK.
That's the first stage of
elimination.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've got the first column
straight.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So of course I move on to the
second column.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I look in that position,
I see a zero.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I look below it,
hoping for a non-zero that I

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
can do a row exchange.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But it's zero below.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So that's telling me that that
column is -- well,

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
what it's really going to be
telling me is that that column

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is a combination of the earlier
columns.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's that second column is
dependent on the earlier

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
columns.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,680
But I don't stop to think here.

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,000
In that column there's nothing
to do.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I go on to the next.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So here's the next pivot.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So there's the first pivot and
there's the second pivot,

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and I just keep this
elimination going downwards.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So, so the next step keeps the
first row, keeps the second row

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
with its pivot,
so I've got my two pivots,

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and does elimination to clear
out the column below that pivot.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So actually you see the
multiplier is one.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It subtracts row two from row
three and produces a row of

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
zeros.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK.
That I would call that matrix
U, right?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's our upper -- well,
I can't quite say upper

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
triangular.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Maybe upper -- I don't know --
upper something.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's in this so-called echelon
form.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The word echelon means,
like, staircase form.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's the, the non-zeros come in
that staircase form.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If there was another pivot
here, then the staircase would

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
include that.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But here's a case where we have
two pivots only.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OK, so actually we've already
discovered the most important

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
number about this matrix.

101
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,000
The number of pivots is two.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That number we will call the
rank of the matrix.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So let me put immediately.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The rank of A -- so I'm telling
you what this word rank means in

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the algorithm.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's equal to the number of
pivots.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And in this case,
two.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
OK, for me that number two is
the crucial number.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK, now I go to -- you remember
I'm always solving A x equals

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
zero, but now I can solve U x
equals zero, right?

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Same solution,
same null space.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OK.
So I could stop here -- why
don't I stop here and do the

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,040
back substitution.

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,000
So now I have to ask you,
how do I describe the

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
solutions?

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There are solutions,
right, to A x equals zero.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I knew there would be.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had three equations in four
unknowns.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I certainly expected some
solutions.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now I want to see what are
they.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OK, here's the critical step.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I refer to it up here as
separating out the pivot

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
variables, the pivot columns,
which are these two.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Here I have two pivot columns.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Those, obviously,
they're the columns with the

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
pivots.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I have two pivot columns.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I have the other columns,
I'll call free.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These are free columns,
OK.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why do I use those words?

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why do I use that word free?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Because now I want to write,
I want to find the solutions to

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
U x equals zero.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Here is the way I do it.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
These free columns I can assign
any number freely to those --

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to the variables x2 and x4,
the ones that multiply columns

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
two and four.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I can assign anything I like
to x2 and x4.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And then I can solve the
equations for x1 and x3.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let me say that again.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If I give -- let me,
let me assign.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, so one particular x is to
assign, say, the value one to

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,050
the, to x2, and zero to x4.

144
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,000
Those are -- that was a free
choice, but it's a convenient

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
choice.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
OK.
Now I want to solve U x equals
zero and find numbers one and

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,450
three, complete the solution.

148
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:46,000
OK.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Can I write down -- let's see.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Shall we just remember what U x
equals zero represents?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What are my equations?

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That first equation is x1 plus
just -- I'm just saying what are

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,710
these matrices meaning.

154
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,000
That's the first equation.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And the second equation was 2x3
+ 4x4=0.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Those are my two equations.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,240
OK.

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,000
Now the point is I can find x1
and x3 by back substitution.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So we're building on what we
already know.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The new thing is that there
were some free variables that I

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
could give any numbers to.

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,100
And I'm systematically going to
make a choice like this,

163
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,000
1 and 0.

164
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now what is x3?

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's, let's go backwards,
back up.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I look at the last equation.
x3 is zero, from the last

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
equation, because,
because x4 we've set x4 to

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
zero, and then we get x3 as
zero.

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
OK.
Now we set x2 to be one,
so what is x1?

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Negative two,
right?

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So then I have negative two
plus two, zero and zero,

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
correctly giving zero.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There is a vector in the null
space.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There is a solution to A x
equals zero.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In fact, what solution is that?

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That simply says that minus two
times the first column plus one

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
times the second column is the
zero column.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Of course that's right.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Minus two of that column plus
one of that, or minus two of

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
that plus one of that.

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That solution is --
that, that's just what we saw

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,810
immediately, that the second
column is twice as big as the

183
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,000
first column.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
OK, tell me some more vectors
in the null space.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I found one.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Tell me, how to get a bunch
more immediately out of that

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
one.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just take multiples of it.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Any multiple of -- I could
multiply this by anything.

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,000
I might as well call it,
I could say,

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
C, some multiple of this.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So let me -- so X could be any
multiple of this one.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
OK, that, that describes now a
line, an infinitely long line in

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,370
four dimensional space.

195
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,140
But -- which is in the null
space.

196
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,000
Is that the whole null space?

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No.
I've got two free variables
here.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,110
I made this choice,
one and zero,

199
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,000
for the free variables,
but I could have made another

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
choice.

201
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let me make the other choice
zero and one.

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You see my system.

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So let me repeat the system.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is the algorithm that you,
you just learned to do.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Do elimination.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Decide which are the pivot
columns and which are the free

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
columns.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,720
That tells you that,
that variables one and three

209
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
are pivot variables,
two and four are free

210
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
variables.

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then those free variables,
you assign them -- you give one

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
of them the value one and the
others the value zero -- in this

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
case, we had a one and a zero --
and complete the solution.

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And you do --
you give the other one the

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
value one and zero.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And now complete the solution.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So let's complete that
solution.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm looking for a vector in the
null space, and it's absolutely

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
going to be different from this
guy, because,

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
because any multiple of that
zero is never going to give the

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
one.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I have somebody new in the
null space, and let me finish it

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
out.
What's x3 here?

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So we're going by back
substitution,

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
looking at this equation.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Now x4 we've changed,
we're doing the other

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
possibility, where x2 is zero
and x4 is one.

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So x3 will happen to be minus
two.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And now what do I get for that
first equation?

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
x1 -- let's see.

231
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Two x3s is minus four plus two
-- do I get a two there?

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Perhaps, yeah.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Two for x1, minus four,
and two.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
OK.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's in the null space.

236
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What does that say about the
columns?

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That says that two of this
column minus two of this column

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
plus this column gives zero,
which it does.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,440
Two of that minus two of that
and one of that gives the zero

240
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,000
column.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
OK, now, now I've found another
vector in the null space.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now we're ready to tell me the
whole null space.

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What are all the solutions to
Ax=0?

244
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've got this guy and when I
have him, what else is,

245
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
goes into the null space along
with that?

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
These are my two special
solutions.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I call them special -- I just
invented that name.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Special solutions.

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's special about them is
the special numbers I gave to

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the free variables,
the values zero and one for the

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,550
free variables.

252
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,000
I could have given the free
variables any values and got

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
vectors in the null space.

254
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But this was a good way to be
sure I got t- got everybody.

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
OK, so once I have him,
I also have any multiple,

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
right?

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I could take any multiple of
that and it's in the null space.

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And now what else -- I left a
little space for what?

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What -- a plus sign.

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I can take any combination.

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Here is a line of vectors in
the null space.

262
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
A bunch of solutions.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,760
Would you rather I say in the
null space or would you rather I

264
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,530
say, OK, I'm solving Ax=0?

265
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, really I'm solving Ux=0.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, OK, let me put in that
crucial plus sign.

267
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm taking all the combinations
of my two special solutions.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's my conclusion there.

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The null space contains,
contains exactly all the

270
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
combinations of the special
solutions.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And how many special solutions
are there?

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There's one for every free
variable.

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,540
And how many free variables are
there?

274
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, I mean, we can see all the
whole picture now.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If the rank R was two,
this is the,

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
this is the number of pivot
variables, right,

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
because it counted the pivots.

278
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So how many free variables?

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, you know it's two,
right?

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What is it in -- for a matrix
that's m rows,

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
n columns, n variables that
means, with rank r?

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How many free variables have we
got left?

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If r of the variables are pivot
variables, we have n-r -- in

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
this case four minus two -- free
variables.

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you see that first of all we
get clean answers here?

286
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We get r pivot variables -- so
there really were r equations

287
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
here.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,090
There looked like three
equations, but there were really

289
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,000
only two independent equations.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And there were n-r variables
that we could choose freely,

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and we gave them those special
zero one values,

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and we got the special
solutions.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
OK.

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For me -- we could stop at that
point.

295
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That gives you a complete
algorithm for finding all the

296
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
solutions to A x equals zero.

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,000
OK.
Again, you do elimination --
going onward when a column,

298
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
when there's nothing to be done
on one column,

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,030
you just continue.

300
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,000
There's this number r,
the number of pivots,

301
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
is crucial, and it leaves n-r
free variables,

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
which you give values zero and
one to.

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I would like to take one more
step.

304
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I would like to clean up this
matrix even more.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So now I'm going to go to --
this is in its,

306
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
this is in echelon form,
upper triangular if you like.

307
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I want to go one more step to
make it as good as it can be.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
OK, so now I'm going to speak
about the reduced row echelon

309
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,300
form.

310
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,000
OK, so now I'm going to speak
about the matrix R,

311
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
which is the reduced row
echelon form.

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So what does that mean?

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,830
That means I just -- I can,
I can work harder on U.

314
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:04,000
So let me start,
let me suppose I got as far as

315
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
U, which was good.

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Notice how that row of zeros
appeared.

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I didn't comment on that,
but I should have.

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,080
That row of zeros up here is
because row three was a

319
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,000
combination of rows one and two,
and elimination discovered that

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
fact.

321
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
When we get a row of zeros,
that's telling us that the --

322
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
original row that was there was
a combination of other rows,

323
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and elimination knocked it out.

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
OK, so we got this far.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,100
Now how can I clean that up
further?

326
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,630
I can do, elimination upwards.

327
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,000
I can get zero above the
pivots.

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So this reduced row echelon
form has zeros above and below

329
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,280
the pivots.

330
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,000
So let me do that.

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So now I'll subtract one of
this from the row above.

332
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That will leave a zero and a
minus two in there.

333
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And that's good.

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
OK, and I can clean it up even
one more step.

335
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can make the pivots -- the
pivots I'm going to make equal

336
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
to one, because I can divide
equation two by the pivot.

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That won't change the
solutions.

338
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So let me do that.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And then I really -- I'm ready
to stop.

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
One, two, zero,
minus two, zero,

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
zero, one, two.

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I divided the second equation
by two, because now I have a one

343
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in the pivot and zeros below.

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
OK.
This is my matrix R.

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I guess I'm hoping that you
could now execute the whole

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
algorithm.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Matlab will do it immediately
with the command -- reduced row

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
echelon form of A.

349
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So if I input that original
matrix A and then I write,

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
then I type that command,
press return,

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
that matrix will appear.

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's the reduced row echelon
form, and it's got all the

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
information as clear as can be.

354
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What, what information has it
got?

355
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, of course it immediately
tells me the pivot rows,

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
pivot rows, one and two,
pivot columns,

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
one and three.

358
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,210
And in fact it's got the
identity matrix in there,

359
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,000
right?

360
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's, it's got zeros above and
below the pivots,

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and the pivots are one,
so it's, so it's got a -- so

362
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
notice the two by two identity
matrix that's sitting in the

363
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
pivot rows and pivot columns.
it's I in the pivot rows and

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
columns.

365
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's got zero rows below.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Those are always indicating
that original rows were,

367
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
were combinations of other
rows.

368
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So we really only had two rows
there.

369
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And now it also -- so there's
the identity.

370
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Now it's also got its free
columns.

371
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And, they're cleaned up as much
as possible.

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Actually, actually it's now so
cleaned up that the special

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
solutions, I can read off -- you
remember I went through the

374
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
steps of computing this -- doing
back substitution?

375
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let me, let me,
instead of that system,

376
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,090
let me take this improved
system.

377
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,710
So I'm going to use these
numbers, right.

378
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,000
In these equations,
what did I do?

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I divided this equation by two
and, oh yeah and I had

380
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,200
subtracted two of this,
which knocked out this guy and

381
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,000
made that a minus sign.

382
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Is that what -- I've now
written Rx equals zero.

383
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Now I guess I'm hoping
everybody in this room

384
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
understands the solutions to the
original A x equals zero,

385
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
the midway, halfway,
U x equals zero,

386
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and the final R x equals zero
are all the same.

387
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Because going from one of those
to another one I didn't mess up.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I just multiplied equations and
subtracted from other equations,

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
which I'm allowed to do.

390
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
OK.
But my point is that now if I
do this free variables and back

391
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
substitution,
it's just, the numbers are

392
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
there.

393
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
When I let x -- so in this guy,
I let x2 be one and x4 be zero.

394
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I, I guess, what I seeing here?

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let me, let me sort of separate
this out here.

396
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm seeing in the pivot,
in the pivot columns,

397
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
if I, if I put the pivot
columns here,

398
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm seeing those.

399
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And I'm -- in the free columns
I'm seeing -- what I seeing in

400
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the free columns?

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
A two, zero in that first free
column, the x2 column,

402
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and a minus two,
two in the fourth column,

403
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
the other free column.

404
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And the row of zeros below,
which of course have no -- that

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
equation is zero equals zero.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's satisfied.

407
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Here's my point.

408
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That when I do back
substitution,

409
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
these numbers are exactly what
shows up -- oh,

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
their signs get switched.

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I was going to say those
numbers, two,

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
minus two, zero,
two, can I just circle the --

413
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
this is the free part of the
matrix.

414
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is the identity part.

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is the free part,
maybe I'll call it F.

416
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This, of course,
I call I, because it's the

417
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
identity.

418
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The free part is a,
I mean, I'm just doing back

419
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
substitution.

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And those free numbers will
show up, with a minus sign,

421
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
because they pop onto the other
side of the equation --

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
so I see minus two,
zero, and I see two,

423
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
minus two.

424
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So that wasn't magic.

425
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It had to happen.

426
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,870
Let me, show you clearly why it
happened.

427
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:52,000
OK, so that's -- this is what
I'm interested in here.

428
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And now let me,
let me just,

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
like, do it,
do it for -- let's suppose

430
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,220
we've, we've got to -- let's
suppose we've got this system

431
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,000
already in, in rref form.

432
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So my matrix R is -- what does
it look like?

433
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
OK, and I'll -- let me pretend
that the pivot columns come

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
first and then whatever's in the
free columns.

435
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And there might be some zero
rows below.

436
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There's a typical -- a pretty
typical reduced row echelon

437
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
form.

438
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You see what's typical.

439
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's got -- this is r by r.

440
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
This is r pivot rows.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
This is r pivot columns.

442
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And here are n-r free columns.

443
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
OK.

444
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell me what are the special
solutions?

445
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What are the -- what's x?

446
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If I want to solve R x equals
zero -- in fact,

447
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
let me -- I'm really going to,
do the whole --

448
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
since these -- this is now
block matrices,

449
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I might as well do all of the
special solutions at once.

450
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So I want to solve R x equals
zero, and I'll have some special

451
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
solutions.

452
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let me, actually -- can I do
them all at once?

453
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm going to create a null
space matrix,

454
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OK.

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
A matrix.

456
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Its, its, its columns are the
special -- the columns are the

457
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
special solutions.

458
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
This is, I'm making it sound
harder, it's going to be totally

459
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
easy.

460
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
N will be this null space
matrix.

461
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I want R N to be the zero
matrix.

462
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
These columns of N are supposed
to multipl- to get multiplied by

463
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
R and give zero columns.

464
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So what N will do the job?

465
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Let me put -- I'm going to put
the identity in the free

466
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
variable part and then minus F
will show up in the pivot

467
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
variables, just the way it did
in that example.

468
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There we had the identity and
F.

469
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Here -- in the special
solution.

470
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So these columns are -- there's
the matrix of special solutions.

471
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And actually,
there -- so there's a Matlab

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
command or a teaching code
command, NULL -- N equal,

473
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
so this is the -- produces the
null basis, the null space

474
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
matrix, NULL of A,
and there it is.

475
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And how does that command
actually work?

476
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,880
It uses Matlab to compute R,
then it picks out the pivot

477
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,000
variables, the free variables,
puts, puts ones and zeros in

478
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,150
for the free variables,
and copies out the pivot

479
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,000
variables.

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It, it does back substitution,
but back substitution for this

481
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
system is totally simple.

482
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What is this system?

483
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
R x equals zero.

484
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So this is R is I F,
and x is the pivot variables

485
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and the free variables,
and it's supposed to give zero.

486
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So what does that mean?

487
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That means that the pivot
variables plus F times the free

488
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
variables give zero.

489
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,560
So let me put F times the free
variables on the other side.

490
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,000
I get minus F times the free
variables.

491
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
There's my, equation,
as simple as it can be.

492
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's what back substitution
comes to when I've reduced and

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
reduced and reduced this system
to the, to the best form,

494
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,000
OK.
And, then if the free
variables, I make this special

495
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
choice of the identity,
then the pivot variables are

496
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,000
minus F.
OK, can I do,
another example?

497
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Could you do another example?

498
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Can I -- let me just take
another matrix and,

499
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and let's go through this
algorithm once more,

500
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,000
OK.
Here we go.

501
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Here's a blackboard for another
matrix, OK.

502
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So I'll call the matrix A
again, but let me make it --

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
yeah, how big shall we make it
this time?

504
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Why don't I do this?

505
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Just for the heck of it.

506
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Let me take the transpose of
this A and see what happens to

507
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that.
Two four six eight and three
six eight ten.

508
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Before we do the calculations,
tell me what's coming?

509
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
How many pivot variables do you
expect here?

510
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
How many columns are going to
have pivots?

511
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
How many -- we have three
columns in that matrix,

512
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but are we going to,
are we going to have three

513
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
pivots?

514
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No, because this third columns
is the sum of the first two

515
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,000
columns.
I'm totally expecting,
totally expecting that these

516
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
will be pivot columns --
because they're independent,

517
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,570
but that this third guy,
the third column,

518
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,000
which is dependent on the first
two, is going to be a free

519
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
column.

520
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Elimination better discover
that.

521
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And elimination will also
straighten out the rows,

522
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
dependent rows and some
independent rows.

523
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What's the, what's the row
reduced echelon form for this?

524
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Let's just do it,
OK.

525
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So, so that's the first pivot.

526
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Two times that away from that
gives me a row of zeros.

527
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Two times that away from that
gives me a zero two two.

528
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And two times that away from
that gives me a zero four four.

529
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
OK, first column is straight.

530
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
First variable is a pivot
variable.

531
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No problem.

532
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
On to the second column.

533
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I look at the second pivot,
it's a zero.

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I look below it.

535
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
There's a two.

536
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
OK, I do a row exchange.

537
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So this zero is now there.

538
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I now have a perfectly good
pivot, and I use it.

539
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
OK, and I subtract two of that
row away from this row.

540
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
All right if I do it like that?

541
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I've got to the form U now.

542
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This was my A.

543
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Now there's my U.

544
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I can see now -- I have to
stop, right?

545
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I would go on to the third
column.

546
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I should have tried.

547
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I quit, but without trying.

548
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I shouldn't have done that.

549
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,790
On to the third column,
look at the pivot position.

550
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,000
It's got a zero in it.

551
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Look below, all zeros.

552
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Now I'm entitled to stop,
OK.

553
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So the rank is two again.

554
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What about the null space?

555
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,160
How many special solutions are
there this time?

556
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
How many special solutions for
this matrix?

557
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I've got -- and which are the
free variables and which are the

558
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
pivot variables and so on?

559
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Pivot columns,
I've got two pivot columns,

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and that's no accident.

561
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The number of pivot columns for
a matrix A, that's a great fact,

562
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that the number of pivot
columns for A and A transpose

563
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
are the same.

564
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And then I have a free column.

565
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
There's a free column.

566
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
One free column,
because the count is three

567
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
minus two.

568
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Three minus two gives me one
free column.

569
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
OK, so now let me solve,
what's in the null space.

570
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
OK, so how do I -- let's see.

571
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
These vectors have length
three.

572
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
They only have three
components.

573
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm making too much space for
the, to write x.

574
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
x has just got three
components, and what are they?

575
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm looking for the null space.

576
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
OK, so how do I start?

577
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I give the free variable some
convenient value.

578
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,250
And what's that?

579
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,820
I set it to one.

580
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,000
I set the free variable to one.

581
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If I set the free variable to
zero and solve for the pivot

582
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
variables, I'll get all zeros:
no progress.

583
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But by setting the free
variable to one -- you see w- my

584
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
two equations now are --
my equations are x1+ 2x2+ 3 x3

585
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
is zero, that's my first
equation.

586
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And my second equation is now
2x2+2x3 equals zero.

587
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And, OK.

588
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,310
So if x3 is one,
then x2 is minus one.

589
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:06,000
And if x3 is one and x2 is
minus one, then maybe x1 is

590
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
minus one.

591
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,740
And actually I go back to check
now.

592
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,000
I don't, like -- I did a quick
calculation mentally.

593
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Can I mentally do a quick
check?

594
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That matrix,
that solution x says that minus

595
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
this column minus this column
plus this one is the zero

596
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
column.

597
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And it is.

598
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Minus that minus that plus that
is zero.

599
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So that's in the null space.

600
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And now you can tell me what
else is in the null space.

601
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What's, what's the whole null
space now?

602
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I multiply by C,
right.

603
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The whole null space is a line.

604
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So that's the description.

605
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You know, if I ask you on a
homework or a quiz or the final

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
what --
give me, describe,

607
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
tell me the null space,
find the null space of this

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
matrix, you can take those
steps.

609
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And that's the answer I'm
looking for.

610
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And I'm looking for that C too,
because that's telling me that

611
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,420
you're remembering that it's a
whole space and not just one

612
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,000
vector.

613
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Later I will ask you for a
basis for the null space.

614
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Then I just want this vector.

615
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But if I ask for the whole null
space, then there's the whole

616
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
line through that vector.

617
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
OK, now one more natural thing
to do with this example,

618
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
right, is keep going to the
reduced matrix,

619
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
R.

620
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So can I push onwards to R?

621
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That should be quick,
but let's just practice.

622
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,710
Let me keep going to R.

623
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,000
OK, so what do I do here?

624
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,010
I subtract -- I clear out above
the pivot, so I subtract that

625
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,000
from that, that's one zero one
is left, right?

626
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
When I subtracted this row from
this it produced a zero above

627
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
this pivot.

628
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And now I want that pivot to be
a one.

629
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So for the R matrix,
I'll divide this equation by

630
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
two, and of course these zero,
zeros are great,

631
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
they don't change.

632
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
There's R.

633
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's R.

634
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You see what R is?

635
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You see the identity matrix
sitting up here?

636
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You see the free part F,
the F part here?

637
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you see the zeros below.

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This is I F zero zero.

639
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And what's the x?

640
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The x has the identity --
well, it's only a single number

641
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
one, but it's the identity
matrix in the free,

642
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
in the free part.

643
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And what does it have in the
pivot variables?

644
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,720
What did back substitution
give?

645
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,000
It gave minus these guys.

646
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You see that what this is is
any multiple of -- this is the

647
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
identity there,
and this is minus F here.

648
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
This is our null space matrix N
for this.

649
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Our, our null space matrix is
the guy whose columns are the

650
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
special solutions.

651
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So their free variables have
the special values one and,

652
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
pivot variables have minus F.

653
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So do you see,
though, how the minus F just

654
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
automatically shows up in the
special solutions.

655
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
That's it really.

656
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I don't think there's anything
more I can say about A x equals

657
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
zero.

658
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
There's more I can say about A
x equal b, but that'll be on

659
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Friday.

660
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
OK, so that's,
that's the null space.

661
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Thanks.
