1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OK, when the camera says,
we'll start.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,930
You want to give me a signal?

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,000
OK, this is lecture eight in
linear algebra,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and this is the lecture where
we completely solve linear

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
equations.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So Ax=b.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,510
That's our goal.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,000
If it has a solution.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It certainly can happen that
there is no solution.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,860
We have to identify that
possibility by elimination.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,000
And then if there is a solution
we want to find out is there

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
only one solution or are -- is
there a whole family of

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
solutions, and then find them
all.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,720
OK.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,730
Can I use as an example the
same matrix that I had last time

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,000
when we were looking for the
null space.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So the, the matrix has rows 1 2
2 2, 2 4 6 8,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and the third row -- you
remember the main point was the

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,070
third row, 3 6 8 10,
is the sum of row one plus row

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,000
two.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In other words,
if I add those left-hand sides,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,180
I get the third left-hand side.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,000
So you can tell me right away
what elimination is going to

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,740
discover about the right-hand
sides.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,000
What's -- there is a condition
on b1, b2, and b3 for this

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
system to have a solution.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Most cases -- if I took these
numbers to be one --

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
5, and 17, there would not be a
solution.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In fact, if I took those first
numbers to be 1 and 5,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
what is the only b3 that would
be OK?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Six.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If the left-hand -- if these
left-hand sides add up to that,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
then B --
I need b1 plus b2 to equal b3.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's just see how elimination
discovers that.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But we can see it coming,
right?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That if -- let me say it in
other words.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If some combination on the
left-hand side gives all 0s then

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the same combination on the
right-hand side must give 0.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
OK.
So let me take that example and
write down instead of copying

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
out all the plus signs,
let me write down the matrix.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8,
and that 6 3 8 10,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
where the third row is the sum
of the first two rows.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now how do we deal with the
right-hand side?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's -- we want to do the
same thing to the right-hand

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
side that we're doing to these
rows on the left side,

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
so we just tack on the
right-hand side as another

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
vector, another column.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So this is the augmented
matrix.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's, it's the matrix A with
the vector b tacked on.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,670
In Matlab, that's all you would
need to type.

51
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,000
OK.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we do elimination on that.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Can we just do elimination
quickly?

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The first pivot is fine,
I subtract two of this away

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
from this, three of this away
from this, so I have 1 2 2 2 b1.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,700
Two of those away will give me
0 0 2 and 4, and that was b2

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,000
minus two b1.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I, I have to do the same thing
to that third,

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
that last column.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then three of these away
from this gave me 0 0 2 4 b3

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
minus three b1s.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So that's the,
that's elimination with the

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
first column completed.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We move on.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's the first pivot still.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Here is the second pivot.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We're always remembering,
now, these are then going to be

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the pivot columns.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And let me get the final result
-- well, let me -- can I do it

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
by eraser?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We're capable of subtracting
this row from this row,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
just by -- that'll knock this
out completely and give me the

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
row of 0s, and on the right-hand
side, when I subtract this away

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
from this, what do I have?

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think I have b3 minus a b2,
and I had minus three b1s.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is going to,
it's going to be a minus a b1.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh yeah that's exactly what I
expect.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,680
So now the -- what's the last
equation?

79
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
The last equation,
this represented by this zero

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
row, that last equation is,
says 0 equals b3 minus b2 minus

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
b1.
So that's the condition for
solvability.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,580
That's the condition on the
right-hand side that we

83
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,000
expected.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It says that b1+b2 has to match
b3, and if our numbers happen to

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
have been 1, 5,
and 6 -- so let me take,

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
suppose b is 1 5 6.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's an OK b.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And when I do this elimination,
what will I have?

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The b1 will still be a 1.
b2 would be 5 minus 2,

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
this would be a 3.
5 -- my 6 minus 5 minus 1,

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
this will be -- this is the
main point -- this will be a 0,

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
thanks.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
OK.
So the last equation is OK now.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I can proceed to solve the
two equations that are really

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
there with four unknowns.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK, I, I, I want to do that,
so this, this b is OK.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It allows a solution.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're going to be,
naturally, interested to keep

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
track what are the conditions on
b that make the equation

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,210
solvable.

101
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:09,000
So let me write down what we
already see before I continue to

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
solve it.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let me first -- solvability,
solvability.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So which -- so this is the
condition on the right-hand

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
sides.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And what is that condition?

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is solvability always of
Ax=b.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So Ax=b is solvable --
well, actually,

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we had an answer in the
language of the column space.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Can you remind me what that
answer is?

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That, that was like our answer
from earlier lecture.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
b had to be in the column
space.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Solvable if -- when -- exactly
when b is in the column space of

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Right?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,630
That just says that b has to be
a combination of the columns,

117
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,000
and of course that's exactly
what the equation is looking

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
for.
So that -- now I want to answer
it -- the same answer but in

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
different language.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Another way to answer this --
if a combination of the rows of

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A gives the zero row,
and this was an example where

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it happened, some combination of
the rows of A produced the zero

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
row -- then what's the
requirement on b?

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Since we're going to do the
same thing to both sides of all

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
equations --
the same combination of the

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,790
components of b has to give 0.

127
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,000
Right?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's -- so if there's a
combination of the rows that

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
gives the zero row,
then the same combination of

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the entries of b must give 0.

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,490
And this isn't the zero row,
that's the zero number.

132
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,000
OK.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Tthis is another way of saying
-- and it is not immediate,

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
right, that these two
statements are equivalent.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But somehow they must be,
because they're both equivalent

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to the solvability of the
system.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
OK.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So we've got this,
this sort of -- like question

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
zero is, does the system have a
solution?

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
OK, I'll come back to discuss
that further.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's go forward when it does.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When there is a solution.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so what's our job now?

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Abstractly we sit back and we
say, OK, there's a solution,

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
finished.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It exists.
But we want to construct it.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So what's the algorithm,
the sequence of steps to find

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
the solution?

149
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,000
That's what I -- and of course
the quiz and the final,

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to give you a system
Ax=b and I'm going to ask you

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
for the solution,
if there is one.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And so this algorithm that you
want to follow.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OK, let's see.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So what's the -- so now to find
the complete solution to Ax=b.

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OK.
Let me start by finding one
solution, one particular

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
solution.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm expecting that I can,
because my system of equations

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
now, that last equation is zero
equals zero, so that's all fine.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,890
I really have two equations --
actually I've got four unknowns,

160
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,000
so I'm expecting to find not
only a solution but a whole

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
bunch of them.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But let's just find one.

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So step one,
a particular solution,

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
x particular.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How do I find one particular
solution?

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,870
Well, let me tell you how I,
how I find it.

167
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,000
So this is -- since there are
lots of solutions,

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,230
you could have your own way to
find a particular one.

169
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,000
But this is a pretty natural
way.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Set all free variables to zero.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Since those free variables are
the guys that can be anything,

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the most convenient choice is
zero.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And then solve Ax=b for the
pivot variables.

174
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So what does that mean in this
example?

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,020
Which are the free variables?

176
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,000
Which, which are the variables
that we can assign freely and

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,020
then there's one and only one
way to find the pivot variables?

178
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,000
They're x2 and -- so x2 is
zero, because that's in a column

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,520
without a pivot,
the second column has no pivot.

180
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,000
And the -- what's the other
one?

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The fourth, x4 is zero.

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because that,
those are the,

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the free ones.

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Those are in the columns with
no pivots.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So you see what my -- so when I
knock -- when x2 and x4 are

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,570
zero, I'm left with the -- what
I left with here?

187
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm just left with -- see,
now I'm not using the two free

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
columns.
I'm only using the pivot
columns.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,350
So I'm really left with x1 --
the first equation is just x1

190
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,000
and two x3s should be the
right-hand side,

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
which we picked to be a one.

192
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And the second equation is two
x3s, as it happened,

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
turned out to be,
three.

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just write it again here with
the x2 and the x4 knocked out,

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,840
since we're set them to zero.

196
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,000
And you see that we're back in
the normal case of having back

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
-- where back substitution will
do it.

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So x3 is three halves,
and then we go back up and x1

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is one minus two x3.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's probably minus two.

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Good.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So now we have the solution,
x particular is the vector

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
minus two zero three halves
zero.

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OK, good.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's one particular solution,
and we should and could plug it

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
into the original system.

207
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really if -- on the quiz,
please, it's a good thing to

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,680
do.

209
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,000
So we did all this,
these, row operations,

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
but this is supposed to solve
the original system,

211
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and I think it does.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
OK.
So that's x particular which
we've got.

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So that's like what's new
today.

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The particular solution comes
-- first you check that you have

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
zero equals zero,
so you're OK on the last

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,000
equations.
And then you set the free
variables to zero,

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,760
solve for the pivot variables,
and you've got a particular

218
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,000
solution, the particular
solution that has zero free

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
variables.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
OK.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now -- but that's only one
solution, and now I'm looking

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
for all.

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,750
So how do I find the rest?

224
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,000
The point is I can add on x --
anything out of the null space.

225
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We know how to find the vectors
in the null space --

226
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because we did it last time,
but I'll remind you what we

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
got.
And then I'll add.

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So the final result will be
that the complete solution --

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
this is now the complete guy --
the complete solution is this

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,700
one particular solution plus
any, any vector,

231
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,000
all different vectors out of
the null space.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
xn, OK.

233
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well why, why this pattern,
because this pattern shows up

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
through all of mathematics,
because it shows up everywhere

235
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
we have linear equations.

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let me just put here the,
the reason.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
A xp, so that's x particular,
so what does Ax particular

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
give?

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,839
That gives the correct
right-hand side b.

240
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,000
And what does A times an x in
the null space give?

241
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Zero.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,089
So I add, and I put in
parentheses.

243
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:24,000
So xp plus xn is b plus zero,
which is b.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So -- oh, what I saying?

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let me just say it in words.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If I have one solution,
I can add on anything in the

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
null space, because anything in
the null space has a zero

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
right-hand side,
and I still have the correct

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
right-hand side B.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So that's my system.

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's my complete solution.

252
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Now let me write out what that
will be for this example.

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So in this example,
x general, x complete,

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,600
the complete solution,
is x particular,

255
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,000
which is minus two zero three
halves zero, with those zeroes

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
in the free variable,
plus --

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you remember there were the
special solutions in the null

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
space that had a one in the free
variables -- or one and zero in

259
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,070
the free variables,
and then we filled in to find

260
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,000
the others?

261
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I've forgotten what they were,
but maybe it was that.

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That was a special solution,
and then there was another

263
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
special solution that had that
free variable zero and this free

264
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
variable equal one,
and I have to fill those in.

265
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's see, can I remember how
those fill in?

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Maybe this was a minus two and
this was a two,

267
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,000
possibly?
I think probably that's right.

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not -- yeah.

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Does that look write to you?

270
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I would have to remember what
are my equations.

271
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Can I, rather than go way back
to that board,

272
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
let me remember the first
equation was two x3 plus two x4

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
equaling zero now,
because I'm looking for the

274
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
guys in the null space.

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So I set x4 to be one and the
second equation,

276
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that I didn't copy again,
gave me minus two for this and

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
then -- yeah,
so I think that's right.

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Two minus four and two gives
zero, check.

279
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
OK.

280
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Those were the special
solutions.

281
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What do we do to get the
complete solution?

282
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
How do I get the complete
solution now?

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I multiply this by anything,
c1, say, and I multiply this by

284
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
anything -- I take any
combination.

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Remember that's how we
described the null space?

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The null space consists of all
combinations of --

287
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so this is xn -- all
combinations of the special

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
solutions.

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There were two special
solutions because there were two

290
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
free variables.

291
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And we want to make that count
-- carefully now.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Just while I'm up here.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So there's, that's what the --
that's the kind of answer I'm

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
looking for.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Is there a constant multiplying
this guy?

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,500
Is there a free constant that
multiplies x particular?

297
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,000
No way.

298
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Right?
x particular solves A xp=b.

299
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not allowed to multiply
that by three.

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But Axn, I'm allowed to
multiply xn by three,

301
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
or add to another xn,
because I keep getting zero on

302
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
the right.

303
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,000
OK.
So, so again,
xp is one particular guy.

304
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
xn is a whole subspace.

305
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Right?

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's one guy plus,
plus anything from a subspace.

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let me draw it.

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,340
Let me try to -- oh.

309
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:21,000
I want to draw,
I want to graph all this -- I

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
want to, I want to plot all
solutions.

311
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Now x.

312
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,520
So what dimension I in?

313
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,000
This is a unfortunate point.

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
How many components does x
have?

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Four.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
There are four unknowns.

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I have to draw a four
dimensional picture on this MIT

318
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
cheap blackboard.

319
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,000
OK.
So here we go.
x1 -- Einstein could do it,

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but, this, this is -- those are
four perpendicular axes in --

321
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
representing four dimensional
space.

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,000
OK.
Where are my solutions?

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Do my solutions form a
subspace?

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Does the set of solutions to
Ax=b form a subspace?

325
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No way.

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What does it actually look
like, though?

327
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
A subspace is in this picture.

328
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This part is a subspace,
right?

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,120
That part is some,
like, two dimensional,

330
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,830
because I've got two
parameters, so it's -- I'm

331
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,000
thinking of this null space as a
two dimensional subspace inside

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
R^4.

333
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
Now I have to tell you and will
tell you next time,

334
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
what does it mean to say a
subspace, what's the dimension

335
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,000
of a subspace.
But you see what it's going to
be.

336
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,000
It's the number of free
independent constants that we

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
can choose.

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So somehow there'll be a two
dimensional subspace,

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
not a line, and not a three
dimensional plane,

340
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
but only a two dimensional guy.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But it's doesn't go through the
origin because it goes through

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
this point.

343
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So there's x particular.
x particular is somewhere here.

344
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
x particular.

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So it's somehow a subspace --
can I try to draw it that way?

346
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's a two dimensional subspace
that goes through x particular

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and then onwards by -- so
there's x particular,

348
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and I added on xn,
and there's x.

349
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,740
There's x=xp+xn.

350
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:54,000
But the xn was anywhere in this
subspace, so that filled out a

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
plane.

352
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's a subspace -- it's not a
subspace, what I saying?

353
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's like a flat thing,
it's like a subspace,

354
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but it's been shifted,
away from the origin.

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,460
It doesn't contain zero.

356
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:10,000
OK.

357
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thanks.

358
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's the picture,
and that's the algorithm.

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,390
So the algorithm is just go
through elimination and,

360
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,000
find the particular solution,
and then find those special

361
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
solutions.

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,550
You can do that.

363
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,000
Let me take our time here in
the lecture to think,

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
about the bigger picture.

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So let me think about -- so
this is my pattern.

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:52,030
Now I want to think -- I want
to ask you about a question -- I

367
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,000
want to ask you some questions.

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So when I mean think bigger,
I mean I'll think about an m by

369
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
n matrix A of rank r.

370
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,000
OK.
What's our definition of rank?

371
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Our current definition of rank
is number of pivots.

372
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OK.
First of all,
how are these numbers related?

373
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Can you tell me a relation
between r and m?

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If I have m rows in the matrix
and R pivots,

375
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
--
then I certainly know,

376
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
always -- what relation do I
know between r and m?

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
r is less or equal,
right?

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Because I've got m rows,
I can't have more than m

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
pivots, I might have m and I
might have fewer.

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Also, I've got n columns.

381
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So what's the relation between
r and n?

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,810
It's the same,
less or equal,

383
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,000
because a column can't have
more than one pivot.

384
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So I can't have more than n
pivots altogether.

385
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
OK, OK.

386
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I have an m by n matrix of
rank r.

387
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I always know r less than
or equal to m,

388
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
r less than or equal to n.

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Now I'm specially interested in
the case of full rank,

390
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
when the rank r is as big as it
can be.

391
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, I guess I've got two
separate possibilities here,

392
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
depending on what these numbers
m and n are.

393
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So let me talk about the case
of full column rank.

394
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And by that I mean r=n.

395
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I want to ask you,
what does that imply about our

396
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,160
solutions?

397
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,000
What does that tell us about
the null space?

398
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What does that tell us about,
the complete solution?

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
OK, so what does that mean?

400
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So I want to ask you,
well, OK, if the rank is n,

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
what does that mean?

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That means there's a pivot in
every column.

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So how many pivot variables are
there?

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
n.

405
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,620
All the columns have pivots in
this case.

406
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,000
So how many free variables are
there?

407
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
None at all.

408
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So no free variables.
r=n, no free variables.

409
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So what does that tell us about
what's going to happen then in

410
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
our, in our little algorithms?

411
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
What will be in the null space?

412
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The null space of A has got
what in it?

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Only the zero vector.

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There are no free variables to
give other values to.

415
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So the null space is only the
zero vector.

416
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And what about our solution to
Ax=b?

417
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Solution to Ax=b?

418
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What, what's the story on that
one?

419
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So now that's coming from
today's lecture.

420
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The solution x is -- what's the
complete solution?

421
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's just x particular,
right?

422
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
If, if, if there is an x,
if there is a solution.

423
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's x equal x particular.

424
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
There's nothing -- you know,
there's just one solution.

425
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If there's one at all.

426
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,860
So it's unique solution --
unique means only one -- unique

427
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,000
solution if it exists,
if it exists.

428
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In other words,
I would say -- let me put it a

429
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
different way.

430
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There're either zero or one
solutions.

431
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This is all in this case r=n.

432
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So I'm -- because many,
many applications in reality,

433
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the columns will be what I'll
later call independent.

434
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And we'll have,
nothing to look for in the null

435
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
space, and we'll only have
particular solutions.

436
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
OK.

437
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Everybody see that possibility?

438
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But I need an example,
right?

439
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So let me create an example.

440
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What sort of a matrix --
what's the shape of a matrix

441
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
that has full column rank?

442
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,470
So can I squeeze in an,
an example here?

443
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,000
If it exists.

444
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Let me put in an example,
and it's just the right space

445
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
to put in an example.

446
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because the example will be
like tall and thin.

447
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It will have -- well,
I mean, here's an example,

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
one two six five,
three one one one.

449
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Brilliant example.

450
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
OK.

451
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So there's a matrix A,
and what's its rank?

452
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What's the rank of that matrix?

453
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
How many pivots will I find if
I do elimination?

454
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,070
Two, right?

455
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,410
Two.

456
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,000
I see a pivot there -- oh
certainly those two columns are

457
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
headed off in different
directions.

458
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
When I do elimination,
I'll certainly get another

459
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
pivot here, fine,
and I can use those to clean

460
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
out below and above.

461
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So the -- actually,
tell me what its row reduced

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
row echelon form would be.

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Can you carry that,
that elimination process to the

464
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
bitter end?

465
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So what do, what does that
mean?

466
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I subtract a multiple of this
row from these rows.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I clean up,
all zeros there.

468
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Then I've got some pivot here.

469
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What do I do with that?

470
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I go subtract it below and
above, and then I divide

471
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
through, and what's R for that
example?

472
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Maybe I can -- you'll allow me
to put that just here in the

473
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
next board.

474
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What's the row reduced echelon
form, just out of practice,

475
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,330
for that matrix?

476
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,000
It's got ones in the pivots.

477
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's got the identity matrix,
a little two by two identity

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
matrix, and below it all zeros.

479
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's a matrix that really has
two independent rows,

480
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and they're the first two,
actually.

481
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The first two rows are
independent.

482
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They're not in the same
direction.

483
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But the other rows are
combinations of the first two,

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
so -- is there always a
solution to Ax=b?

485
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,370
Tell me what's the picture
here?

486
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,000
For this matrix A,
this is a case of full column

487
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
rank.

488
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The two columns are -- give two
pivots.

489
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
There's nothing in the null
space.

490
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There's no combination of those
columns that gives the zero

491
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
column except the zero zero
combination.

492
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So there's nothing in the null
space.

493
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But is there always a solution
to A X equal B?

494
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,340
What's up with A X equal B?

495
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,000
I've got four,
four equations here,

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and only two Xs.

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So the answer is certainly no.

498
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There's not always a solution.

499
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I may have zero solutions,
and if I make a random choice,

500
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll have zero solutions.

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Or if I make a great particular
choice of the right-hand side,

502
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
which just happens to be a
combination of those two guys --

503
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
like tell me one right-hand side
that would have a solution.

504
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,040
Tell me a right-hand side that
would have a solution.

505
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,150
Well, 0 0 0 0,
OK.

506
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,000
No prize for that one.

507
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Tell me another one.

508
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Another right-hand side that
has a solution would be 4 3 7 6.

509
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,130
I could add the two columns.

510
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:20,000
Right?

511
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What would be the total
complete solution if the

512
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
right-hand side was 4 3 7 6?

513
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
There would be the particular
solution one one,

514
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
one of that column plus one of
that, and that would be the only

515
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,000
solution.
So there would be -- x
particular would be one one in

516
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
the case when the right side is
the sum of those two columns,

517
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
and that's it.

518
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So that would be a case with
one solution.

519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OK.

520
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That, this is the typical setup
with full column rank.

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Now I go to full row rank.

522
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You see the sort of natural
symmetry of this discussion.

523
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Full row rank means r=m.

524
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So this is what I'm interested
in now, r=m.

525
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
OK, what's up with that?

526
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
How many pivots?
m.

527
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So what happens when we do
elimination in that case?

528
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm going to get m pivots.

529
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So every row has a pivot,
right?

530
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Every row has a pivot.

531
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Then what about solvability?

532
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What about this business of --
for which right-hand sides can

533
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,280
I solve it?

534
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,200
So that's my question.

535
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,000
I can solve Ax=b for which
right-hand sides?

536
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Do you see what's coming?

537
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I do elimination,
I don't get any zero rows.

538
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So there aren't any
requirements on b.

539
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I can solve Ax=b for every b.

540
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I can solve Ax=b for every
right-hand side.

541
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So this is the existence,
exists a solution.

542
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Now tell me,
so the, u- u- so every row has

543
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
a pivot in it.

544
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So how many free variables are
there?

545
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
How many free variables in this
case?

546
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If I had n variables to start
with, how many are used up by

547
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,610
pivot variables?
r, which is m.

548
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:29,000
So I'm left with,
left with n-r free variables.

549
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
OK.

550
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So this case of full row rank I
can always solve,

551
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and then this tells me how many
variables are free,

552
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,370
and this is of course n-m.

553
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,000
This is n-m free variables.

554
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Can I do an example?

555
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,460
You know, the best way for me
to do an example is just to

556
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,000
transpose that example.

557
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So let me take,
let me take that matrix that

558
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
had column one two six five and
make it a row.

559
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And let me take three one one
one as the second row.

560
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,060
And let me ask you,
this is my matrix A,

561
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,000
what's its rank?

562
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What's the rank of that matrix?

563
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,400
Sorry to ask,
but not sorry really,

564
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
because we're just getting the
idea of rank.

565
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What's the rank of that matrix?

566
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Two, exactly,
two.

567
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
There will be two pivots.

568
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What will the row reduced
echelon form be?

569
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Anybody know that one?

570
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Actually, tell me not only --
you have to tell me not only

571
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the, there'll be two pivots but
which will be the pivot columns.

572
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Which columns of this matrix
will be pivot columns?

573
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So the first column is fine,
and then I go on to the next

574
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,840
column, and what do I get?

575
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,000
Do I get a second pivot out of
--

576
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
will I get a second pivot in
this position?

577
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yes.
So the pivots,
when I get all the way to R,

578
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,650
will be there.

579
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,000
And here will be some numbers.

580
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,590
This is the part that I
previously called F.

581
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:22,400
This is the part that --
the pivot columns in R will be

582
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
the identity matrix.

583
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
There are no zero rows,
no zero rows,

584
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because the rank is two.

585
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But there'll be stuff over
here.

586
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And that will,
enter the special solutions and

587
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the null space.

588
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000
OK.
So this is a typical matrix
with r=m smaller than n.

589
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Now finally I've got a space
here for r=m=n.

590
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm off in the corner here with
the most important case of all.

591
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So what's up with this matrix?

592
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So let me give an example.

593
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
OK, brilliant example,
1 2 3 1.

594
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Tell me what -- how do I
describe a matrix that has rank

595
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
r=m=n?

596
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So the matrix is square,
right, it's a square matrix.

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,830
And if I know its rank is --
it's full rank,

598
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,000
now.

599
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,690
I don't have to say full column
rank or full row rank --

600
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,000
I just say full rank,
because the count,

601
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
column count and the row count
are the same,

602
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and the rank is as big as it
can be.

603
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And what kind of a matrix have
I got?

604
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,570
It's invertible.

605
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,000
So that's exactly the
invertible matrices.

606
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
r=m=n means the --
what's the row echelon form,

607
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
the reduced row echelon form,
for an invertible matrix?

608
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
For a square,
nice, square,

609
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
invertible matrix?

610
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's I.

611
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Right.
So you see that the,
the good matrices are the ones

612
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,360
that kind of come out trivially
in R.

613
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,660
You reduce them all the way to
the identity matrix.

614
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,000
What's the null space for this,
for this matrix?

615
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Can I just hammer away with
questions?

616
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
What's the null space for this
matrix?

617
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The null space of that matrix
is the zero vector only.

618
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The zero vector only.

619
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,030
What are the conditions to
solve Ax=b?

620
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,000
Which right-hand sides b are
OK?

621
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
If I want to solve Ax=b for
this example,

622
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,080
so A is this,
b is b1 b2, what are the

623
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,000
conditions on b1 and b2?

624
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
None at all,
right.

625
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So this is the case,
this is the case where I can

626
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
solve -- so I've coming back
here, I can -- since the rank

627
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
equals m, I can solve for every
b.

628
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And since the rank is also n,
there's a unique solution.

629
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Let me summarize the whole
picture here.

630
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Here's the whole picture.

631
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I could have r=m=n.

632
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,860
This is the case where this is
the identity matrix.

633
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,000
And this is the case where
there is one solution.

634
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,590
That's the square invertible
chapter two case.

635
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,000
Now we're into chapter three.

636
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We could have r=m smaller than
n.

637
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Now that's what we had over
there, and the row echelon form

638
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
looked like the identity with
some zero rows.

639
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,680
And that was the case where
there are zero or one solution.

640
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,000
When I say solution I mean to
Ax=b.

641
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So this case,
there's always one.

642
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
This case there's zero or one.

643
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And now let me take the case of
full column rank,

644
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
but some, extra rows.

645
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,950
So now R has -- well,
the identity -- I'm almost

646
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:08,000
tempted to write the identity
matrix and then F,

647
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
but that isn't necessarily
right.

648
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I have -- is that right?

649
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Am I getting this correct here?

650
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, I'm not!

651
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
My God!

652
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
This is the case R equals n,
the columns,

653
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
the columns are,
are OK.

654
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That's the case that was on
that board, r=n,

655
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
full column rank.

656
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Now I want the case where m is
smaller than n and I've got

657
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
extra columns.

658
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,000
OK.
There we go.

659
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So this is now the case of full
row rank, and it looks like I F

660
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:06,000
except that I can't be sure that
the pivot columns are the first

661
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
columns.

662
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So the I and the F,
could be partly mixed into the

663
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I.
Can I write that with just like
that?

664
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So the F could be sort of
partly into the I if the first

665
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
columns weren't the pivot
columns.

666
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,530
Now how many solutions in this
case?

667
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,000
There's always a solution.

668
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is the existence case.

669
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,180
There's always a solution.

670
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,000
We're not getting any zero
rows.

671
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
There are no zero rows here.

672
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So there's always either one or
infinitely many solutions.

673
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
OK.

674
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,490
Actually, I guess there's
always an infinite number,

675
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,000
because we always have some
null space to deal with.

676
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Then the final case is where r
is smaller than m and smaller

677
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
than n.

678
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,000
OK.
Now that's the case where R is
the identity with some free

679
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
stuff but with some zero rows
too.

680
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And that's the case where
there's either no solution --

681
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because we didn't get a zero
equals zero for some bs,

682
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
or infinitely many solutions.

683
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
OK.

684
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Do you -- this board really
summarizes the lecture,

685
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and this sentence summarizes
the lecture.

686
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The rank tells you everything
about the number of solutions.

687
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That number,
the rank r, tells you all the

688
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
information except the exact
entries in the solutions.

689
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
For that you go to the matrix.

690
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
OK, good.

691
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Have a great weekend,
and I'll see you on Monday.
