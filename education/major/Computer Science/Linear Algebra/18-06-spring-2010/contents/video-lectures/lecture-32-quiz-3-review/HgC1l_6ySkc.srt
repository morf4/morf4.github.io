1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
OK, here we go with,
quiz review for the third quiz

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that's coming on Friday.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, one key point is that the
quiz covers through chapter six.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Chapter seven on linear
transformations will appear on

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the final exam,
but not on the quiz.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I won't review linear
transformations today,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but they'll come into the full
course review on the very last

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
lecture.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So today, I'm reviewing chapter
six, and I'm going to take some

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
old exams, and I'm always ready
to answer questions.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And I thought,
kind of help our memories if I

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
write down the main topics in
chapter six.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, already,
on the previous quiz,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,980
we knew how to find eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, we knew how to find them
by that determinant of A minus

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
lambda I equals zero.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But, of course,
there could be shortcuts.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There could be,
like, useful information about

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the eigenvalues that we can
speed things up with.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
OK.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, the new stuff starts out
with a differential equation,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so I'll do a problem.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll do a differential equation
problem first.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's special about symmetric
matrices?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Can we just say that in words?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'd better write it down,
though.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's special about symmetric
matrices?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Their eigenvalues are real.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix always come out real,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,370
and there always are enough
eigenvectors.

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,000
Even if there are repeated
eigenvalues, there are enough

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
eigenvectors,
and we can choose those

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
eigenvectors to be orthogonal.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So if A equals A transposed,
the big fact will be that we

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
can diagonalize it,
and those eigenvector matrix,

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
with the eigenvectors in the
column, can be an orthogonal

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
matrix.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So we get a Q lambda Q
transpose.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That, in three symbols,
expresses a wonderful fact,

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
a fundamental fact for
symmetric matrices.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OK.
Then, we went beyond that fact
to ask about positive definite

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
matrices, when the eigenvalues
were positive.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll do an example of that.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now we've left symmetry.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Similar matrices are any square
matrices, but two matrices are

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
similar if they're related that
way.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And what's the key point about
similar matrices?

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Somehow, those matrices are
representing the same thing in

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
different basis,
in chapter seven language.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In chapter six language,
what's up with these similar

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,520
matrices?

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,000
What's the key fact,
the key positive fact about

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
similar matrices?

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They have the same eigenvalues.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Same eigenvalues.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So if one of them grows,
the other one grows.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If one of them decays to zero,
the other one decays to zero.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Powers of A will look like
powers of B, because powers of A

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and powers of B only differ by
an M inverse and an M way on the

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
outside.
So if these are similar,
then B to the k-th power is M

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
inverse A to the k-th power M.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that's why I say,
eh, this M, it does change the

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
eigenvectors,
but it doesn't change the

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
eigenvalues.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,590
So same lambdas.

66
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,000
And then, finally,
I've got to review the point

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,270
about the SVD,
the Singular Value

68
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,000
Decomposition.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OK.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So that's what this quiz has
got to cover,

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and now I'll just take problems
from earlier exams,

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
starting with a differential
equation.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
OK.

74
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,000
And always ready for questions.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So here is an exam from about
the year zero,

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and it has a three by three.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So that was -- but it's a
pretty special-looking matrix,

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it's got zeroes on the
diagonal, it's got minus ones

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
above, and it's got plus ones
like that.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So that's the matrix A.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OK.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Step one is,
well, I want to solve that

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
equation.
I want to find the general
solution.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I haven't given you a u(0)
here, so I'm looking for the

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
general solution,
so now what's the form of the

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
general solution?

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
With three arbitrary constants
going to be inside it,

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because those will be used to
match the initial condition.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the general form is u at
time t is some multiple of the

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
first special solution.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The first special solution will
be growing like the eigenvalue,

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and it's the eigenvector.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So that's a pure exponential
solution, just staying with that

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
eigenvector.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,190
Of course, I haven't found,
yet, the eigenvalues and

96
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,000
eigenvectors.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's, normally,
the first job.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now, there will be second one,
growing like e to the lambda

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
two, and a third one growing
like e to the lambda three.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So we're all done -- well,
we haven't done anything yet,

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
actually.
I've got to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and then I would match u(0) by
choosing the right three

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
constants.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
OK.
So now I ask -- ask you about
the eigenvalues and

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
eigenvectors,
and you look at this matrix and

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
what do you see in that matrix?

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Um, well, I guess we might ask
ourselves right away,

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is it singular?

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Is it singular?

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because, if so,
then we really have a head

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
start, we know one of the
eigenvalues is zero.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that matrix singular?

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Eh, I don't know,
do you take the determinant to

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
find out?
Or maybe you look at the first
row and third row and say,

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
hey, the first row and third
row are just opposite signs,

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they're linear-dependent?

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The first column and third
column are dependent -- it's

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
singular.
So one eigenvalue is zero.

119
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's make that lambda one.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lambda one, then,
will be zero.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
OK.
Now we've got a couple of other
eigenvalues to find,

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and, I suppose the simplest way
is to look at A minus lambda I

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So let me just put minus lambda
in here, minus ones above,

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ones below.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But, actually,
before I do it,

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that matrix is not symmetric,
for sure, right?

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In fact, it's the very opposite
of symmetric.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That matrix A transpose,
how is A transpose connected to

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's negative A.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's an anti-symmetric matrix,
skew-symmetric matrix.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And we've met,
maybe, a two-by-two example of

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
skew-symmetric matrices,
and let me just say,

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
what's the deal with their
eigenvalues?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They're pure imaginary.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They'll be on the imaginary
axis, there be some multiple of

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I if it's an anti-symmetric,
skew-symmetric matrix.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I'm looking for multiples of
I, and of course,

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that's zero times I,
that's on the imaginary axis,

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but maybe I just do it out,
here.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Lambda cubed.
well, maybe that's minus lambda

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
cubed, and then a zero and a
zero.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Zero, and then maybe I have a
plus a lambda,

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and another plus lambda,
but those go with a minus sign.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Am I getting minus two lambda
equals zero?

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,520
So.

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,160
So I'm solving lambda cube plus
two lambda equals zero.

148
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,000
So one root factors out lambda,
and the the rest is lambda

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
squared plus two.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OK.
This is going the way we
expect, right?

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Because this gives the root
lambda equals zero,

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and gives the other two roots,
which are lambda equal what?

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The solutions of when is lambda
squared plus two equals zero

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
then the eigenvalues those guys,
what are they?

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They're a multiple of i,
they're just square root of two

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
i.
When I set this equals to zero,
I have lambda squared equal to

157
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,320
minus two, right?

158
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
To make that zero?

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And the roots are square root
of two i and minus the square

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
root of two i.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So now I know what those are.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll put those in,
now.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Either the zero t is just a
one.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's just a one.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is square root of two I
and this is minus square root of

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
two I.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, is the solution decaying to
zero?

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is this a completely stable
problem where the solution is

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
going to zero?

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In fact, all these things are
staying the same size.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This thing is getting
multiplied by this number.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,350
e to the I something t,
that's a number that has

174
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,000
magnitude one,
and sort of wanders around the

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
unit circle.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Same for this.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So that the solution doesn't
blow up, and it doesn't go to

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
zero.
OK.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And to find out what it
actually is, we would have to

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
plug in initial conditions.

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But actually,
the next question I ask is,

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
when does the solution return
to its initial value?

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I won't even say what's the
initial value.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is a case in which I think
this solution is periodic after.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
At t equals zero,
it starts with c1,

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,140
c2, and c3, and then at some
value of t, it comes back to

187
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,000
that.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,090
So that's a very special
question, Well,

189
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:37,000
let's just take three seconds,
because that special question

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,640
isn't likely to be on the quiz.

191
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
But it comes back to the start,
when?

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, whenever we have e to the
two pi i, that's one,

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and we've come back again.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it comes back to the start.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's periodic,
when this square root of two i

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
-- shall I call it capital T,
for the period?

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For that particular T,
if that equals two pi i,

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
then e to this thing is one,
and we've come around again.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,930
So the period is T is
determined here,

200
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,310
cancel the i-s,
and T is pi times the square

201
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,000
root of two.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So that's pretty neat.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We get all the information
about all solutions,

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,290
we haven't fixed on only one
particular solution,

205
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,000
but it comes around again.

206
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,990
So this was probably my first
chance to say something about

207
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,000
the whole family of
anti-symmetric,

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
skew-symmetric matrices.

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
OK.
And then, finally,
I asked, take two eigenvectors

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
(again, I haven't computed the
eigenvectors) and it turns out

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
they're orthogonal.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They're orthogonal.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The eigenvectors of a symmetric
matrix, or a skew-symmetric

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
matrix, are always orthogonal.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I guess may conscience makes me
tell you, what are all the

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
matrices that have orthogonal
eigenvectors?

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And symmetric is the most
important class,

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so that's the one we've spoken
about.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But let me just put that little
fact down, here.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Orthogonal x-s.
eigenvectors.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A matrix has orthogonal
eigenvectors,

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the exact condition -- it's
quite beautiful that I can tell

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you exactly when that happens.

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It happens when A times A
transpose equals A transpose

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
times A.
Any time that's the condition
for orthogonal eigenvectors.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And because we're interested in
special families of vectors,

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
tell me some special families
that fit.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is the whole requirement.

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's a pretty special
requirement most matrices have.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So the average three-by-three
matrix has three eigenvectors,

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
but not orthogonal.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But if it happens to commute
with its transpose,

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
then, wonderfully,
the eigenvectors are

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,340
orthogonal.

235
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,000
Now, do you see how symmetric
matrices pass this test?

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Of course.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If A transpose equals A,
then both sides are A squared,

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
we've got it.

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
How do anti-symmetric matrices
pass this test?

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If A transpose equals minus A,
then we've got it again,

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
because we've got minus A
squared on both sides.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,240
So that's another group.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,000
And finally,
let me ask you about our other

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
favorite family,
orthogonal matrices.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do orthogonal matrices pass
this test, if A is a Q,

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
do they pass the test for
orthogonal eigenvectors.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, if A is Q,
an orthogonal matrix,

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
what is Q transpose Q?

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's I.

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And what is Q Q transpose?

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's I, we're talking square
matrices here.

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So yes, it passes the test.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So the special cases are
symmetric, anti-symmetric (I'll

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
say skew-symmetric,) and
orthogonal.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Those are the three important
special classes that are in this

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
family.

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
OK.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's like a comment that,
could have been made back in,

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
section six point four.

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
OK, I can pursue the
differential equations,

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
also this question,
didn't ask you to tell me,

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
how would I find this matrix
exponential, e to the At?

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So can I erase this?

264
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,330
I'll just stay with this
same...

265
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,000
how would I find e to the At?

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,090
Because, how does that come in?

267
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,000
That's the key matrix for a
differential equation,

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
because the solution is -- the
solution is u(t) is e^(At) u(0).

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So this is like the fundamental
matrix that multiplies the given

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
function and gives the answer.

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And how would we compute it if
we wanted that?

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We don't always have to find e
to the At, because I can go

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
directly to the answer without
any e to the At-s,

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but hiding here is an e to the
At, and how would I compute it?

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,660
Well, if A is diagonalizable.

276
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,000
So I'm now going to put in my
usual if A can be diagonalized

277
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
(and everybody remember that
there is an if there,

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because it might not have
enough eigenvectors) this

279
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
example does have enough,
random matrices have enough.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So if we can diagonalize,
then we get a nice formula for

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
this, because an S comes way out
at the beginning,

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and S inverse comes way out at
the end, and we only have to

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
take the exponential of lambda.

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And that's just a diagonal
matrix, so that's just e the

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
lambda one t,
these guys are showing up,

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
now, in e to the lambda nt.

287
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,270
OK?

288
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,000
That's a really quick review of
that formula.

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's something we can compute
it quickly if we have done the S

290
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and lambda part.

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If we know S and lambda,
then it's not hard to take that

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
step.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
OK, that's some comments on
differential equations.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I would like to go on to a next
question that I started here.

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And it's, got several parts,
and I can just read it out.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What we're given is a
three-by-three matrix,

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and we're told its eigenvalues,
except one of these is,

298
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
like, we don't know,
and we're told the

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
eigenvectors.

300
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I want to ask you about the
matrix.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,000
OK.
So, first question.

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is the matrix diagonalizable?

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,190
And I really mean for which c,
because I don't know c,

304
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,000
so my questions will all be,
for which is there a condition

305
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
on c, does one c work.

306
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But your answer should tell me
all the c-s that work.

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm not asking for you to tell
me, well, c equal four,

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
yes, that checks out.

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want to know all the c-s that
make it diagonalizable.

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
OK?

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What's the real on
diagonalizable?

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We need enough eigenvectors,
right?

313
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We don't care what those
eigenvalues are,

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it's eigenvectors that count
for

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,100
diagonalizable,
and we need three independent

316
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
ones, and are those three guys
independent?

317
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes.
Actually, let's look at them
for a moment.

318
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What do you see about those
three vectors right away?

319
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They're more than independent.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can you see why those three got
chosen?

321
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because it will come up in the
next part, they're orthogonal.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Those eigenvectors are
orthogonal.

323
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They're certainly independent.

324
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So the answer to diagonalizable
is, yes, all c,

325
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
all c.

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Doesn't matter.
c could be a repeated guy,

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
but we've got enough
eigenvectors,

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so that's what we care about.

329
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
OK, second question.

330
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,650
For which values of c is it
symmetric?

331
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,430
OK, what's the answer to that
one?

332
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:44,000
If we know the same setup if we
know that much about it,

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
we know those eigenvectors,
and we've noticed they're

334
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
orthogonal, then which c-s will
work?

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So the eigenvalues of that
symmetric matrix have to be

336
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,000
real.
So all real c.

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If c was i, the matrix wouldn't
have been symmetric.

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But if c is a real number,
then we've got real

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
eigenvalues, we've got
orthogonal eigenvectors,

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,590
that matrix is symmetric.

341
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,000
OK, positive definite.

342
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
OK, now this is a sub-case of
symmetric, so we need c to be

343
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
real, so we've got a symmetric
matrix, but we also want the

344
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
thing to be positive definite.

345
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,310
Now, we're looking at
eigenvalues, we've got a lot of

346
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,000
tests for positive definite,
but eigenvalues,

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
if we know them,
is certainly a good,

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
quick, clean test.

349
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,000
Could this matrix be positive
definite?

350
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No.

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, because it's got an
eigenvalue zero.

352
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It could be positive
semi-definite,

353
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
you know, like consolation
prize, if c was greater or equal

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
to zero, it would be positive
semi-definite.

355
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But it's not,
no.

356
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,790
Semi-definite,
if I put that comment in,

357
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:25,000
semi-definite,
that the condition would be c

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
greater or equal to zero.

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That would be all right.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
OK.

361
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Next part.

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Is it a Markov matrix?

363
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Hm.

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Could this matrix be,
if I choose the number c

365
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
correctly, a Markov matrix?

366
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well, what do we know about
Markov matrices?

367
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Mainly, we know something about
their eigenvalues.

368
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
One eigenvalue is always one,
and the other eigenvalues are

369
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
smaller.

370
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Not larger.

371
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So an eigenvalue two can't
happen.

372
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So the answer is,
no, not a ma- that's never a

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Markov matrix.

374
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,730
OK?

375
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,000
And finally,
could one half of A be a

376
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,360
projection matrix?

377
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,000
So could it- could this --
eh-eh could this be twice a

378
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
projection matrix?

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So let me write it this way.

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Could A over two be a
projection matrix?

381
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OK, what are projection
matrices?

382
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
They're real.

383
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean, th- they're symmetric,
so their eigenvalues are real.

384
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But more than that,
we know what those eigenvalues

385
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
have to be.

386
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What do the eigenvalues of a
projection matrix have to be?

387
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
See, that any nice matrix we've
got an idea about its

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
eigenvalues.

389
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So the eigenvalues of
projection matrices are zero and

390
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,000
one.
Zero and one,
only.

391
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because P squared equals P,
let me call this matrix P,

392
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
so P squared equals P,
so lambda squared equals

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
lambda, because eigenvalues of P
squared are lambda squared,

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and we must have that,
so lambda equals zero or one.

395
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,880
OK.

396
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:30,000
Now what value of c will work
there?

397
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So, then, there are some value
that will work,

398
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and what will work?
c equals zero will work,

399
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
or what else will work?
c equal to two.

400
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Because if c is two,
then when we divide by two,

401
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
this Eigenvalue of two will
drop to one, and so will the

402
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
other one, so,
or c equal to two.

403
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
OK, those are the guys that
will work, and it was the fact

404
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
that those eigenvectors were
orthogonal, the fact that those

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,630
eigenvectors were orthogonal
carried us a lot of the way,

406
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,000
here.

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If they weren't orthogonal,
then symmetric would have been

408
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
dead, positive definite would
have been dead,

409
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
projection would have been
dead.

410
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,080
But those eigenvectors were
orthogonal, so it came down to

411
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
the eigenvalues.

412
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
OK, that was like a chance to
review a lot of this chapter.

413
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,870
Shall I jump to the singular
value decomposition,

414
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:58,000
then, as the third,
topic for, for the review?

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
OK, so I'm going to.
jump to this.

416
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,000
OK.
So this is the singular value
decomposition,

417
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
known to everybody as the SVD.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And that's a factorization of A
into orthogonal times diagonal

419
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
times orthogonal.

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And we always call those U and
sigma and V transpose.

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
OK.

422
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And the key to that -- this is
for every matrix,

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
every A, every A.

424
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Rectangular,
doesn't matter,

425
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
whatever, has this
decomposition.

426
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So it's really important.

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And the key to it is to look at
things like A transpose A.

428
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Can we remember what happens
with A transpose A?

429
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
If I just transpose that I get
V sigma transpose U transpose,

430
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
that's multiplying A,
which is U, sigma V transpose,

431
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and the result is V on the
outside, s- U transpose U is the

432
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
identity, because it's an
orthogonal matrix.

433
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So I'm just left with sigma
transpose sigma in the middle,

434
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that's a diagonal,
possibly rectangular diagonal

435
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
by its transpose,
so the result,

436
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
this is orthogonal,
diagonal, orthogonal.

437
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, I guess,
actually, this is the SVD for A

438
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
transpose A.

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Here I see orthogonal,
diagonal, and orthogonal.

440
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Great.
But a little more is happening.

441
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,000
For A transpose A,
the difference is,

442
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
the orthogonal guys are the
same.

443
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's V and V transpose.

444
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What I seeing here?

445
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm seeing the factorization
for a symmetric matrix.

446
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This thing is symmetric.

447
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So in a symmetric case,
U is the same as V.

448
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
U is the same as V for this
symmetric matrix,

449
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and, of course,
we see it happening.

450
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,000
OK.
So that tells us,
right away, what V is.

451
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
V is the eigenvector matrix for
A transpose A.

452
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
OK.
Now, if you were here when I
lectured about this topic,

453
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
when I gave the topic on
singular value decompositions,

454
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,220
you'll remember that I got into
trouble.

455
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:00,650
I'm sorry to remember that
myself, but it happened.

456
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,000
OK.

457
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
How did it happen?

458
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was in great shape for a
while, cruising along.

459
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So I found the eigenvectors for
A transpose A.

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Good.

461
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I found the singular values,
what were they?

462
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What were the singular values?

463
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The singular value number i,
or -- these are the guys in

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
sigma -- this is diagonal with
the number sigma in it.

465
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This diagonal is sigma one,
sigma two, up to the rank,

466
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
sigma r, those are the non-zero
ones.

467
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So I found those,
and what are they?

468
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Remind me about that?

469
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Well, here, I'm seeing them
squared, so their squares are

470
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,000
the eigenvalues of A transpose
A.

471
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Good.
So I just take the square root,
if I want the eigenvalues of A

472
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
transpose --
If I want the sigmas and I know

473
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
these, I take the square root,
the positive square root.

474
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
OK.

475
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Where did I run into trouble?

476
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Well, then, my final step was
to find U.

477
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And I didn't read the book.

478
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So, I did something that was
practically right,

479
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
but --
well, I guess practically right

480
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
is not quite the same.

481
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,100
OK, so I thought,
OK, I'll look at A A transpose.

482
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,000
What happened when I looked at
A A transpose?

483
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Let me just put it here,
and then I can feel it.

484
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,140
OK, so here's A A transpose.

485
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,000
So that's U sigma V transpose,
that's A, and then the

486
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,490
transpose is V sigma transpose,
U sigma transpose.

487
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,000
Fine.

488
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,110
And then, in the middle is the
identity again,

489
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,000
so it looks great.

490
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
U sigma sigma transpose,
U transpose.

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Fine.

492
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,050
All good, and now these columns
of U are the eigenvectors,

493
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,000
that's U is the eigenvector
matrix for this guy.

494
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That was correct,
so I did that fine.

495
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Where did something go wrong?

496
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,620
A sign went wrong.

497
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,000
A sign went wrong because --
and now -- now I see,

498
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
actually, somebody told me
right after class,

499
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
we can't tell from this
description which sign to give

500
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,230
the eigenvectors.

501
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,000
If these are the eigenvectors
of this matrix,

502
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
well, if you give me an
eigenvector and I change all its

503
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
signs, we've still got another
eigenvector.

504
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So what I wasn't able to
determine (and I had a

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
fifty-fifty change and life let
me down,) the signs I just

506
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
happened to pick for the
eigenvectors,

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
one of them I should have
reversed the sign.

508
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So, from this,
I can't tell whether the

509
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
eigenvector or its negative is
the right one to use in there.

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So the right way to do it is
to, having settled on the signs,

511
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,260
the Vs also,
I don't know which sign to

512
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,000
choose, but I choose one.

513
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I choose one.

514
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And then, instead,
I should have used the one that

515
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
tells me what sign to choose,
the rule that A times a V is

516
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
sigma times the U.

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So, having decided on the V,
I multiply by A,

518
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll notice the factor sigma
coming out, and there will be a

519
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
unit vector there,
and I now know exactly what it

520
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
is, and not only up to a change
of sign.

521
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So that's the good and,
of course, this is the main

522
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
point about the SVD.

523
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's the point that we've
diagonalized,

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that's A times the matrix of Vs
equals U times the diagonal

525
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
matrix of sigmas.

526
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's the same as that.

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,000
OK.
So that's, like,
correcting the wrong sign from

528
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
that earlier lecture.

529
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And that would complete that,
so that's how you would compute

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the SVD.
Now, on the quiz,
I going to ask -- well,

531
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
maybe on the final.

532
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So we've got quiz and final
ahead.

533
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Sometimes, you might be asked
to find the SVD if I give you

534
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the matrix -- let me come back,
now, to the main board -- or,

535
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I might give you the pieces.

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And I might ask you something
about the matrix.

537
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
For example,
suppose I ask you,

538
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
oh, let's say,
if I tell you what sigma is --

539
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
OK.

540
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Let's take one example.

541
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Suppose sigma is -- so all
that's how we would compute

542
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
them.

543
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,260
But now, suppose I give you
these.

544
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:52,000
Suppose I give you sigma is,
say, three two.

545
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I tell you that U has a
couple of columns,

546
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and V has a couple of columns.

547
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
OK.

548
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Those are orthogonal columns,
of course, because U and V are

549
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
orthogonal.

550
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm just sort of,
like, getting you to think

551
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
about the SVD,
because we only had that one

552
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
lecture about it,
and one homework,

553
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,440
and, what kind of a matrix have
I got here?

554
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,000
What do I know about this
matrix?

555
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
All I really know right now is
that its singular values,

556
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,010
those sigmas are three and two,
and the only thing interesting

557
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:40,000
that I can see in that is that
they're not zero.

558
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I know that this matrix is
non-singular,

559
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
right?

560
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's invertible,
I don't have any zero

561
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
eigenvalues, and zero singular
values, that's invertible,

562
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
there's a typical SVD for a
nice two-by-two non-singular

563
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
invertible good matrix.

564
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
If I actually gave you a
matrix, then you'd have to find

565
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
the Us and the Vs as we just
spoke.

566
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But, there.

567
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Now, what if the two wasn't a
two but it was -- well,

568
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
let me make an extreme case,
here -- suppose it was minus

569
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
five.

570
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,430
That's wrong,
right away.

571
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,000
That's not a singular value
decomposition,

572
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
right?

573
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The singular values are not
negative.

574
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So that's not a singular value
decomposition,

575
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and forget it.

576
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,000
OK.
So let me ask you about that
one.

577
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What can you tell me about that
matrix?

578
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's singular,
right?

579
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's got a singular matrix
there in the middle,

580
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
and, let's see,
so, OK, it's singular,

581
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
maybe you can tell me,
its rank?

582
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What's the rank of A?

583
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,460
It's clearly -- somebody just
say it -- one,

584
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,000
thanks.

585
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The rank is one,
so the null space,

586
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
what's the dimension of the
null space?

587
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,680
One.

588
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,000
Right?

589
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We've got a two-by-two matrix
of rank one, so of all that

590
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
stuff from the beginning of the
course is still with us.

591
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The dimensions of those
fundamental spaces is still

592
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
central, and a basis for them.

593
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Now, can you tell me a vector
that's in the null space?

594
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And then that will be my last
point to make about the SVD.

595
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Can you tell me a vector that's
in the null space?

596
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,150
So what would I multiply by and
get zero, here?

597
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,000
I think the answer is probably
v2.

598
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I think probably v2 is in the
null space, because I think that

599
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
must be the eigenvector going
with this zero eigenvalue.

600
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes.

601
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Have a look at that.

602
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And I could ask you the null
space of A transpose.

603
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I could ask you the column
space.

604
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
All that stuff.

605
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,260
Everything is sitting there in
the SVD.

606
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,000
The SVD takes a little more
time to compute,

607
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but it displays all the good
stuff about a matrix.

608
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000
OK.
Any question about the SVD?

609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let me keep going with further
topics.

610
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Now, let's see.

611
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Similar matrices we've talked
about, let me see if I've got

612
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,910
another, -- OK.

613
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:05,000
Here's a true false,
so we can do that,

614
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
easily.

615
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So.
Question, A given.

616
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
A is symmetric and orthogonal.

617
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
OK.

618
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So beautiful matrices like that
don't come along every day.

619
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But what can we say first about
its eigenvalues?

620
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Actually, of course.

621
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Here are our two most important
classes of matrices,

622
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and we're looking at the
intersection.

623
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So those really are neat
matrices, and what can you tell

624
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
me about what could the possible
eigenvalues be?

625
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Eigenvalues can be what?

626
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,550
What do I know about the
eigenvalues of a symmetric

627
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,170
matrix?

628
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,000
Lambda is real.

629
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What do I know about the
eigenvalues of an orthogonal

630
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
matrix?

631
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Ha.

632
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Maybe nothing.

633
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,230
But, no, that can't be.

634
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:14,000
What do I know about the
eigenvalues of an orthogonal

635
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,000
matrix?
Well, what feels right?

636
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Basing mathematics on just a
little gut instinct here,

637
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the eigenvalues of an
orthogonal matrix ought to have

638
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
magnitude one.

639
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Orthogonal matrices are like
rotations, they're not changing

640
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the length, so orthogonal,
the eigenvalues are one.

641
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,160
Let me just show you why.

642
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,000
Why?

643
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So the matrix,
can I call it Q for orthogonal

644
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
for the moment?

645
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If I look at Q x equal lambda
x, how do I see that this thing

646
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
has magnitude one?

647
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I take the length of both
sides.

648
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This is taking lengths,
taking lengths,

649
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
this is whatever the magnitude
is times the length of x.

650
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And what's the length of Q x if
Q is an orthogonal matrix?

651
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
This is something you should
know.

652
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's the same as the length of
x.

653
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Orthogonal matrices don't
change lengths.

654
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So lambda has to be one.

655
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Right.

656
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,000
OK.
That's worth committing to
memory, that could show up

657
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,990
again.

658
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,000
OK.

659
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So what's the answer now to
this question,

660
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
what can the eigenvalues be?

661
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There's only two possibilities,
and they are one and the other

662
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
one, the other possibility is
negative one,

663
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
right, because these have the
right magnitude,

664
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and they're real.

665
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,000
OK.
TK.
true -- OK.

666
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
True or false?

667
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A is sure to be positive
definite.

668
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, this is a great matrix,
but

669
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
is it sure to be positive
definite?

670
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,000
No.
If it could have an eigenvalue
minus one, it wouldn't be

671
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,580
positive definite.

672
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,000
True or false,
it has no repeated eigenvalues.

673
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's false,
too.

674
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
In fact, it's going to have
repeated eigenvalues if it's as

675
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,840
big
as three by three,

676
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,600
one of these c- one of these,
at least, will have to get

677
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,000
repeated.

678
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Sure.
So it's got repeated
eigenvalues, but,

679
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is it diagonalizable?

680
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's got these many,
many, repeated eigenvalues.

681
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
If it's fifty by fifty,
it's certainly got a lot of

682
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
repetitions.

683
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Is it diagonalizable?

684
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yes.
All symmetric matrices,
all orthogonal matrices can be

685
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
diagonalized.

686
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And, in fact,
the eigenvectors can even be

687
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,670
chosen orthogonal.

688
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,000
So it could be,
sort of, like,

689
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
diagonalized the best way with
a Q, and not just any old S.

690
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000
OK.
Is it non-singular?

691
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,180
Is a symmetric orthogonal
matrix non-singular?

692
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,000
Sure.

693
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Orthogonal matrices are always
non-singular.

694
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,240
And, obviously,
we don't have any zero

695
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,000
Eigenvalues.

696
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Is it sure to be
diagonalizable?

697
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yes.

698
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Now, here's a final step --
show that one-half of A plus I

699
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is A -- that is,
prove one-half of A plus I is a

700
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
projection matrix.

701
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
OK?
Let's see.

702
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,000
What do I do?

703
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I could see two ways to do
this.

704
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I could check the properties of
a projection matrix,

705
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
which are what?

706
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
A projection matrix is
symmetric.

707
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Well, that's certainly
symmetric, because A is.

708
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And what's the other property?

709
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I should square it,
and hopefully get the same

710
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
thing back.

711
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So can I do that,
square and see if I get the

712
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
same thing back?

713
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So if I square it,
I'll get one-quarter of A

714
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
squared plus two A plus I,
right?

715
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,430
And the question is,
does that agree with p- the

716
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,000
thing itself?

717
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
One-half A plus I.

718
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Hm.
I guess I'd like to know
something about A squared.

719
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What is A squared?

720
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's our problem.

721
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What is A squared?

722
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If A is symmetric and
orthogonal, A is symmetric and

723
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
orthogonal.

724
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
This is what we're given,
right?

725
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's symmetric,
and it's orthogonal.

726
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So what's A squared?

727
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I.
A squared is I,
because A times A -- if A

728
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,000
equals its own inverse,
so A times A is the same as A

729
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
times A inverse,
which is I.

730
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So this A squared here is I.

731
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And now we've got it.

732
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We've got two identities over
four, that's good,

733
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and we've got two As over four,
that's good.

734
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,000
OK.
So it turned out to be a
projection matrix safely.

735
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And we could also have said,
well, what are the eigenvalues

736
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
of this thing?

737
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What are the eigenvalues of a
half A plus I?

738
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
If the eigenvalues of A are one
and minus one,

739
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
what are the eigenvalues of A
plus I?

740
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Just stay with it these last
thirty seconds here.

741
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What if I know these
eigenvalues of A,

742
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and I add the identity,
the eigenvalues of A plus I are

743
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
zero and two.

744
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And then when I divide by two,
the eigenvalues are zero and

745
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,000
one.
So it's symmetric,
it's got the right eigenvalues,

746
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
it's a projection matrix.

747
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
OK, you're seeing a lot of
stuff about eigenvalues,

748
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and special matrices,
and that's what the quiz is

749
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
about.

750
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
OK, so good luck on the quiz.
