1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,775
I've been multiplying
matrices already,

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:15,125
but certainly time for
me to discuss the rules

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,000
for matrix multiplication.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And the interesting part is
the many ways you can do it,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and they all give
the same answer.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And they're all important.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So matrix multiplication,
and then, come inverses.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we mentioned the
inverse of a matrix.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's a big deal.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Lots to do about inverses
and how to find them.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, so I'll begin with how
to multiply two matrices.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,750
First way, okay, so suppose
I have a matrix A multiplying

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:01,000
a matrix B and -- giving
me a result -- well,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I could call it C.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A times B.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, let me just review
the rule for this entry.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,510
That's the entry in
row i and column j.

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,000
So that's the i j entry.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,740
Right there is C i j.

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,000
We always write the row number
and then the column number.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I might -- I might --
maybe I take it C 3 4,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
just to make it specific.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,250
So instead of i j,
let me use numbers.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,000
C 3 4.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,120
So where does that come
from, the three four entry?

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,500
It comes from row three, here,
row three and column four,

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
as you know.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Column four.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,500
And can I just write
down, or can we

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,000
write down the formula for it?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If we look at the whole
row and the whole column,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,928
the quick way for me to
say it is row three of A --

35
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:16,000
I could use a dot
for dot product.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I won't often use
that, actually.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dot column four of B.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,149
But this gives us a
chance to just, like,

39
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:29,000
use a little matrix notation.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are the entries?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's this first
entry in row three?

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That number that's
sitting right there is...

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A, so it's got two
indices and what are they?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,888
3 1.

45
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,000
So there's an a 3 1 there.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now what's the first guy
at the top of column four?

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So what's sitting up there?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
B 1 4, right.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,150
So that this dot product
starts with A 3 1 times B 1 4.

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,000
And then what's the next -- so
this is like I'm accumulating

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
this sum, then comes the next
guy, A 3 2, second column,

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
times B 2 4, second row.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So it's b A 3 2,
B 2 4 and so on.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just practice with indices.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, let me even practice
with a summation formula.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So this is -- most of the
course, I use whole vectors.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,552
I very seldom, get
down to the details

58
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:52,000
of these particular entries,
but here we'd better do it.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So it's some kind
of a sum, right?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of things in row three,
column K shall I say?

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Times things in
row K, column four.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you see that that's
what we're seeing here?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,200
This is K is one, here
K is two, on along --

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,000
so the sum goes all the
way along the row and down

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the column, say, one to N.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that's what the C three
four entry looks like.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A sum of a three K b K four.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,863
Just takes a little
practice to do that.

69
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:35,363
Okay.

70
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:38,267
And -- well, maybe
I should say --

71
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:44,000
when are we allowed to
multiply these matrices?

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are the shapes
of these things?

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The shapes are -- if we allow
them to be not necessarily

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
square matrices.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If they're square,
they've got to be the same

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,666
size.

77
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:04,000
If they're rectangular,
they're not the same size.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,180
If they're rectangular,
this might be -- well,

79
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,000
I always think of A as m
by n. m rows, n columns.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,850
So that sum goes to n.

81
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,785
Now what's the point -- how
many rows does B have to have?

82
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:15,285
n.

83
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:18,135
The number of rows in
B, the number of guys

84
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:22,501
that we meet coming down has
to match the number of ones

85
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,000
across.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So B will have to
be n by something.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Whatever.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
P. So the number of columns here
has to match the number of rows

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
there, and then
what's the result?

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What's the shape of the result?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's the shape
of C, the output?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, it's got these same
m rows -- it's got m rows.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And how many columns?

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
P. m by P. Okay.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,571
So there are m times P little
numbers in there, entries,

96
00:05:57,571 --> 00:06:01,000
and each one, looks like that.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Okay.

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
So that's the standard rule.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's the way people think
of multiplying matrices.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I do it too.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,920
But I want to talk
about other ways

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,000
to look at that
same calculation,

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,945
looking at whole
columns and whole rows.

104
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:28,444
Okay.

105
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:32,000
So can I do A B C again?

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A B equaling C again?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But now, tell me about...

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll put it up here.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So here goes A, again,
times B producing C.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And again, this is m by n.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is n by P and
this is m by P.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Now I want to look
at whole columns.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,426
I want to look at
the columns of --

115
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:14,000
here's the second way
to multiply matrices.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because I'm going to build
on what I know already.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How do I multiply a
matrix by a column?

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I know how to multiply
this matrix by that column.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Shall I call that column one?

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That tells me column
one of the answer.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The matrix times the first
column is that first column.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,270
Because none of
this stuff entered

123
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,000
that part of the answer.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,724
The matrix times
the second column

125
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:49,000
is the second column
of the answer.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you see what I'm saying?

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That I could think of
multiplying a matrix

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,728
by a vector, which I
already knew how to do,

129
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:06,725
and I can think of just P
columns sitting side by side,

130
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:11,940
just like resting
next to each other.

131
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,000
And I multiply A times
each one of those.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I get the P
columns of the answer.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,140
Do you see this as --
this is quite nice,

134
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,336
to be able to think, okay,
matrix multiplication works

135
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,200
so that I can just think
of having several columns,

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,000
multiplying by A and getting
the columns of the answer.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, like, here's column one
shall I call that column one?

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And what's going in there
is A times column one.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So that's the picture
a column at a time.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So what does that tell me?

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What does that tell me
about these columns?

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,350
These columns of C
are combinations,

144
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,000
because we've seen that
before, of columns of A.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,778
Every one of these
comes from A times this,

146
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:28,250
and A times a vector
is a combination

147
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,000
of the columns of A.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,800
And it makes sense, because
the columns of A have length m

149
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,000
and the columns of
C have length m.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,688
And every column of
C is some combination

151
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:47,000
of the columns of A.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,500
And it's these
numbers in here that

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,000
tell me what combination it is.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you see that?

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That in that answer, C,
I'm seeing stuff that's

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
combinations of these columns.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now, suppose I look at it
-- that's two ways now.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The third way is
look at it by rows.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So now let me change to rows.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,468
So now I can think
of a row of A --

162
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:33,285
a row of A multiplying all these
rows here and producing a row

163
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,550
of the product.

164
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,886
So this row takes a
combination of these rows

165
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:45,000
and that's the answer.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So these rows of C are
combinations of what?

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tell me how to finish that.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,776
The rows of C, when I have a
matrix B, it's got its rows

169
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:06,000
and I multiply by A,
and what does that do?

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It mixes the rows up.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It creates combinations
of the rows of B, thanks.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Rows of B.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's what I wanted to
see, that this answer --

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I can see where the
pieces are coming from.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The rows in the answer are
coming as combinations of these

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,583
rows.

177
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:36,000
The columns in the answer are
coming as combinations of those

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,666
columns.

179
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,000
And so that's three ways.

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now you can say, okay,
what's the fourth way?

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,714
The fourth way -- so that's
-- now we've got, like,

182
00:11:52,714 --> 00:12:01,000
the regular way, the column way,
the row way and -- what's left?

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The one that I can -- well,
one way is columns times rows.

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What happens if I multiply --
So this was row times column,

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,955
it gave a number.

186
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:20,454
Okay.

187
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:25,000
Now I want to ask you
about column times row.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If I multiply a column
of A times a row of B,

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
what shape I ending up with?

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,247
So if I take a
column times a row,

191
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:45,000
that's definitely different from
taking a row times a column.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So a column of A was -- what's
the shape of a column of A?

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
m by one.

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A column of A is a column.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's got m entries
and one column.

196
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And what's a row of B?

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's got one row and P columns.

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,500
So what's the shape -- what do
I get if I multiply a column

199
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
by a row?

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I get a big matrix.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I get a full-sized matrix.

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If I multiply a column by a
row -- should we just do one?

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Let me take the column two three
four times the row one six.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That product there -- I
mean, when I'm just following

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the rules of matrix
multiplication,

206
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
those rules are just looking
like -- kind of petite,

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,333
kind of small, because
the rows here are so short

208
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,664
and the columns
there are so short,

209
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:57,000
but they're the same
length, one entry.

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So what's the answer?

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,900
What's the answer if I do two
three four times one six, just

212
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,000
for practice?

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, what's the first
row of the answer?

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Two twelve.

215
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And the second row of the
answer is three eighteen.

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And the third row of the
answer is four twenty four.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's a very special
matrix, there.

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Very special matrix.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,328
What can you tell me
about its columns,

220
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:35,000
the columns of that matrix?

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They're multiples
of this guy, right?

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They're multiples of that one.

223
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Which follows our rule.

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,150
We said that the columns of
the answer were combinations,

225
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,000
but there's only -- to take
a combination of one guy,

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it's just a multiple.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,904
The rows of the
answer, what can you

228
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:00,000
tell me about those three rows?

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They're all multiples
of this row.

230
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,050
They're all multiples of
one six, as we expected.

231
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,000
But I'm getting a
full sized matrix.

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,612
And now, just to complete
this thought, if I have --

233
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:29,600
let me write down
the fourth way.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,000
A B is a sum of columns
of A times rows of B.

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So that, for example, if my
matrix was two three four

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and then had another column,
say, seven eight nine,

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and my matrix here has -- say,
started with one six and then

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,360
had another column
like zero zero, then --

239
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,000
here's the fourth way, okay?

240
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I've got two columns there,
I've got two rows there.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So the beautiful rule is --
see, the whole thing by columns

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,500
and rows is that I can take the
first column times the first

243
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,000
row and add the second
column times the second row.

244
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,700
So that's the fourth way -- that
I can take columns times rows,

245
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:41,000
first column times first row,
second column times second row

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and add.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Actually, what will I get?

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What will the answer be for
that matrix multiplication?

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, this one it's just
going to give us zero,

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
so in fact I'm back to
this -- that's the answer,

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,990
for that matrix multiplication.

252
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,690
I'm happy to put up here
these facts about matrix

253
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,000
multiplication, because it
gives me a chance to write down

254
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
special matrices like this.

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is a special matrix.

256
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
All those rows lie
on the same line.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All those rows lie on
the line through one six.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If I draw a picture of
all these row vectors,

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they're all the same direction.

260
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,050
If I draw a picture of
these two column vectors,

261
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,000
they're in the same direction.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,875
Later, I would
use this language.

263
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,000
Not too much later, either.

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,176
I would say the
row space, which is

265
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:39,816
like all the
combinations of the rows,

266
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:43,000
is just a line for this matrix.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The row space is the line
through the vector one six.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All the rows lie on that line.

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And the column space
is also a line.

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,248
All the columns lie on the
line through the vector two

271
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,000
three four.

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So this is like a
really minimal matrix.

273
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And it's because of these ones.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Okay.

275
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
So that's a third way.

276
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,833
Now I want to say one more thing
about matrix multiplication

277
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:24,000
while we're on the subject.

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And it's this.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You could also multiply --
You could also cut the matrix

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
into blocks and do the
multiplication by blocks.

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yet that's actually so, useful
that I want to mention it.

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Block multiplication.

283
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,554
So I could take my matrix A
and I could chop it up, like,

284
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:56,332
maybe just for simplicity,
let me chop it into two --

285
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,000
into four square blocks.

286
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,170
Suppose it's square.

287
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,940
Let's just take a nice case.

288
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,000
And B, suppose it's
square also, same size.

289
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So these sizes don't
have to be the same.

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What they have to do
is match properly.

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,230
Here they certainly will match.

292
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:25,000
So here's the rule for
block multiplication,

293
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that if this has blocks like,
A -- so maybe A1, A2, A3,

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
A4 are the blocks here,
and these blocks are B1,

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,980
B2,3 and B4?

296
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,000
Then the answer
I can find block.

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,565
And if you tell me
what's in that block,

298
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,000
then I'm going to be quiet
about matrix multiplication

299
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,917
for the rest of the day.

300
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,000
What goes into that block?

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,750
You see, these might be
-- this matrix might be --

302
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,320
these matrices might be, like,
twenty by twenty with blocks

303
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,780
that are ten by ten, to take the
easy case where all the blocks

304
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,000
are the same shape.

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And the point is that I could
multiply those by blocks.

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,470
And what goes in here?

307
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,000
What's that block in the answer?

308
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,408
A1 B1, that's a
matrix times a matrix,

309
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:25,000
it's the right size, ten by ten.

310
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Any more?

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Plus, what else goes in there?

312
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
A2 B3, right?

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's just like block
rows times block columns.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nobody, I think, not even
Gauss could see instantly

315
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that it works.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,054
But somehow, if we check
it through, all five ways

317
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:55,000
we're doing the same
multiplications.

318
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So this familiar
multiplication is

319
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,452
what we're really
doing when we do it

320
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:08,000
by columns, by rows by columns
times rows and by blocks.

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay.

322
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I just have to, like,
get the rules straight

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
for matrix multiplication.

324
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,240
Okay.

325
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,000
All right, I'm ready
for the second topic,

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
which is inverses.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

328
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ready for inverses.

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,875
And let me do it for
square matrices first.

330
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,375
Okay.

331
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,000
So I've got a square matrix A.

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And it may or may not
have an inverse, right?

333
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,520
Not all matrices have inverses.

334
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,000
In fact, that's the most
important question you can ask

335
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,666
about the matrix, is if it's
-- if you know it's square,

336
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,000
is it invertible or not?

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,571
If it is invertible, then
there is some other matrix,

338
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:14,000
shall I call it A inverse?

339
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,228
And what's the -- if
A inverse exists --

340
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:25,000
there's a big "if" here.

341
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If this matrix exists, and it'll
be really central to figure out

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
when does it exist?

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,300
And then if it does exist,
how would you find it?

344
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,935
But what's the equation
here that I haven't --

345
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:49,000
that I have to finish now?

346
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This matrix, if it exists
multiplies A and produces,

347
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I think, the identity.

348
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But a real -- an inverse
for a square matrix could be

349
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,126
on the right as well -- this
is true, too, that it's --

350
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:28,560
if I have a -- yeah in
fact, this is not --

351
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,333
this is probably the -- this
is something that's not easy

352
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,000
to prove, but it works.

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,857
That a left -- square matrices,
a left inverse is also a right

354
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:42,357
inverse.

355
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:47,000
If I can find a matrix on the
left that gets the identity,

356
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,500
then also that
matrix on the right

357
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,000
will produce that identity.

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,552
For rectangular matrices,
we'll see a left inverse

359
00:23:57,552 --> 00:24:00,000
that isn't a right inverse.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
In fact, the shapes
wouldn't allow it.

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But for square
matrices, the shapes

362
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,680
allow it and it happens,
if A has an inverse.

363
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, so give me some
cases -- let's see.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,500
I hate to be negative
here, but let's talk

365
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,000
about the case with no inverse.

366
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So -- these matrices are called
invertible or non singular --

367
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,270
those are the good ones.

368
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,360
And we want to be able
to identify how --

369
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,000
if we're given a matrix,
has it got an inverse?

370
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Can I talk about
the singular case?

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
No inverse.

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
All right.

373
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Best to start with an example.

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Tell me an example -- let's
get an example up here.

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,462
Let's make it two by two --
of a matrix that has not got

376
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:11,000
an inverse.

377
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And let's see why.

378
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Let me write one up.

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,690
No inverse.

380
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,000
Let's see why.

381
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Let me write up --
one three two six.

382
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Why does that matrix
have no inverse?

383
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You could answer
that various ways.

384
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Give me one reason.

385
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,110
Well, you could -- if you
know about determinants,

386
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:00,000
which you're not supposed to,
you could take its determinant

387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,901
and you would get -- Zero.

388
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:03,400
Okay.

389
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Now -- all right.

390
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let me ask you other reasons.

391
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,400
I mean, as for other
reasons that that matrix

392
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
isn't invertible.

393
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Here, I could use
what I'm saying here.

394
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Suppose A times other
matrix gave the identity.

395
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Why is that not possible?

396
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because -- oh, yeah -- I'm
thinking about columns here.

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,500
If I multiply this matrix A by
some other matrix, then the --

398
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,000
the result -- what can you
tell me about the columns?

399
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
They're all multiples
of those columns, right?

400
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,744
If I multiply A by
another matrix that --

401
00:26:57,744 --> 00:27:02,380
the product has columns that
come from those columns.

402
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,000
So can I get the
identity matrix?

403
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No way.

404
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,630
The columns of the identity
matrix, like one zero --

405
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,664
it's not a combination
of those columns,

406
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,815
because those two
columns lie on the --

407
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:18,000
both lie on the same line.

408
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,070
Every combination is just
going to be on that line

409
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,000
and I can't get one zero.

410
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,532
So, do you see that sort of
column picture of the matrix

411
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,000
not being invertible.

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
In fact, here's another reason.

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This is even a more
important reason.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Well, how can I
say more important?

415
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
All those are important.

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This is another way to see it.

417
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,380
A matrix has no inverse
-- yeah -- here --

418
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,000
now this is important.

419
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,380
A matrix has no -- a square
matrix won't have an inverse

420
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,000
if there's no inverse
because I can solve --

421
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,996
I can find an X of -- a
vector X with A times --

422
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:20,000
this A times X giving zero.

423
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
This is the reason I like best.

424
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That matrix won't
have an inverse.

425
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Can you -- well, let
me change I to U.

426
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So tell me a vector X that,
solves A X equals zero.

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,880
I mean, this is, like,
the key equation.

428
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,220
In mathematics, all
the key equations

429
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,000
have zero on the
right-hand side.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So what's the X?

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,822
Tell me an X here -- so
now I'm going to put --

432
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:04,000
slip in the X that you tell
me and I'm going to get zero.

433
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What X would do that job?

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Three and negative one?

435
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is that the one you
picked, or -- yeah.

436
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Or another -- well, if
you picked zero with zero,

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,200
I'm not so excited, right?

438
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Because that would always work.

439
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,632
So it's really the
fact that this vector

440
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:27,000
isn't zero that's important.

441
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's a non zero vector and
three negative one would do it.

442
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That just says three of this
column minus one of that column

443
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,901
is the zero column.

444
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:39,400
Okay.

445
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,000
So now I know that A
couldn't be invertible.

446
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But what's the reasoning?

447
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
If A X is zero, suppose I
multiplied by A inverse.

448
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah, well here's the reason.

449
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Here -- this is why this
spells disaster for an inverse.

450
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,500
The matrix can't have an
inverse if some combination

451
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,000
of the columns gives
z- it gives nothing.

452
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Because, I could
take A X equals zero,

453
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I could multiply by A inverse
and what would I discover?

454
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,330
Suppose I take that equation
and I multiply by --

455
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,400
if A inverse existed, which
of course I'm going to come

456
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
to the conclusion it can't
because if it existed,

457
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
if there was an A inverse
to this dopey matrix,

458
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I would multiply that equation
by that inverse and I would

459
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
discover X is zero.

460
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If I multiply A by A inverse
on the left, I get X.

461
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If I multiply by A inverse
on the right, I get zero.

462
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So I would discover X was zero.

463
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But it -- X is not zero.

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
X -- this guy wasn't zero.

465
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There it is.

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's three minus one.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,400
So, conclusion -- only, it takes
us some time to really work

468
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,600
with that conclusion -- our
conclusion will be that non

469
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
invertible matrices,
singular matrices,

470
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
some combinations of their
columns gives the zero column.

471
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They they take some
vector X into zero.

472
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And there's no way A
inverse can recover, right?

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's what this equation says.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,830
This equation says I take
this vector X and multiplying

475
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,000
by A gives zero.

476
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,688
But then when I
multiply by A inverse,

477
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,000
I can never escape from zero.

478
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So there couldn't
be an A inverse.

479
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Where here -- okay,
now fix -- all right.

480
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Now let me take -- all right,
back to the positive side.

481
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,350
Let's take a matrix that
does have an inverse.

482
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,852
And why not invert it?

483
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:02,352
Okay.

484
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:07,280
Can I -- so let me take on
this third board a matrix --

485
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,000
shall I fix that up a little?

486
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Tell me a matrix that
has got an inverse.

487
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, let me say one three
two -- what shall I put there?

488
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, don't put six,
I guess is -- right?

489
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Do I any favorites here?

490
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,666
One?

491
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,000
Or eight?

492
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I don't care.

493
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What, seven?

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,501
Seven.

495
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

496
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Seven is a lucky number.

497
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
All right, seven, okay.

498
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay.

499
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,840
So -- now what's our idea?

500
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,000
We believe that this
matrix is invertible.

501
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,333
Those who like determinants have
quickly taken its determinant

502
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,000
and found it wasn't zero.

503
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Those who like columns,
and probably that --

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,632
that department is not
totally popular yet --

505
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:10,000
but those who like columns
will look at those two columns

506
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and say, hey, they point
in different directions.

507
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I can get anything.

508
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Now, let me see, what do I mean?

509
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
How I going to
computer A inverse?

510
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So A inverse --
here's A inverse, now,

511
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and I have to find it.

512
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And what do I get when I
do this multiplication?

513
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,400
The identity.

514
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,364
You know, forgive me for
taking two by two s, but --

515
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:49,000
lt's good to keep the
computations manageable and let

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the ideas come out.

517
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay, now what's
the idea I want?

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,304
I'm looking for this
matrix A inverse, how

519
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,000
I going to find it?

520
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Right now, I've got
four numbers to find.

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm going to look
at the first column.

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Let me take this
first column, A B.

523
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What's up there?

524
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What -- tell me this.

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What equation does the
first column satisfy?

526
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The first column satisfies A
times that column is one zero.

527
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The first column of the answer.

528
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,464
And the second column,
C D, satisfies A times

529
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,150
that second column is zero one.

530
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:46,000
You see that finding the inverse
is like solving two systems.

531
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,224
One system, when the right
hand side is one zero --

532
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm just going to split
it into two pieces.

533
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't even need to rewrite it.

534
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I can take A times --
so let me put it here.

535
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,000
A times column j of A inverse
is column j of the identity.

536
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,200
I've got n equations.

537
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:27,070
I've got, well,
two in this case.

538
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,932
And they have the
same matrix, A,

539
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:32,000
but they have different
right-hand sides.

540
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,904
The right hand sides
are just the columns

541
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,000
of the identity, this
guy and this guy.

542
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And these are the two solutions.

543
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,684
Do you see what I'm going --
I'm looking at that equation

544
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,000
by columns.

545
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,100
I'm looking at A
times this column,

546
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,000
giving that guy, and A times
that column giving that guy.

547
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,135
So -- Essentially -- so
this is like the Gauss --

548
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,000
we're back to Gauss.

549
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,332
We're back to solving systems of
equations, but we're solving --

550
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:03,000
we've got two right hand
sides instead of one.

551
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That's where Jordan comes in.

552
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,200
So at the very beginning
of the lecture,

553
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:24,000
I mentioned Gauss Jordan,
let me write it up again.

554
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

555
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Here's the Gauss-Jordan idea.

556
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Gauss Jordan solve
two equations at once.

557
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,555
Okay.

558
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:44,000
Let me show you how
the mechanics go.

559
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
How do I solve a
single equation?

560
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So the two equations
are one three two seven,

561
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,980
multiplying A B gives one zero.

562
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,446
And the other
equation is the same

563
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:11,000
one three two seven
multiplying C D gives zero one.

564
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,210
Okay.

565
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,660
That'll tell me the two
columns of the inverse.

566
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,000
I'll have inverse.

567
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,195
In other words, if I can
solve with this matrix A,

568
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:25,955
if I can solve with
that right hand

569
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:30,000
side and that right-hand
side, I'm invertible.

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I've got it.

571
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay.

572
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And Jordan sort of said to
Gauss, solve them together,

573
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
look at the matrix -- if
we just solve this one,

574
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,424
I would look at one
three two seven,

575
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:51,000
and how do I deal with
the right-hand side?

576
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I stick it on as an
extra column, right?

577
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That's this augmented matrix.

578
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,086
That's the matrix when I'm
watching the right hand

579
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:06,750
side at the same time, doing
the same thing to the right side

580
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,000
that I do to the left?

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I just carry it along
as an extra column.

582
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,710
Now I'm going to carry
along two extra columns.

583
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,000
And I'm going to do
whatever Gauss wants, right?

584
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm going to do elimination.

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,072
I'm going to get
this to be simple

586
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:30,000
and this thing will
turn into the inverse.

587
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This is what's coming.

588
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,807
I'm going to do elimination
steps to make this

589
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,630
into the identity,
and lo and behold,

590
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,000
the inverse will show up here.

591
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
K--- let's do it.

592
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Okay.

593
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So what are the
elimination steps?

594
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,400
So you see -- here's my matrix
A and here's the identity, like,

595
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,000
stuck on, augmented on.

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
STUDENT: I'm sorry...

597
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
STRANG: Yeah?

598
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
STUDENT: -- is the two and the
three supposed to be switched?

599
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
STRANG: Did I -- oh, no,
they weren't supposed to be

600
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
switched.

601
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Sorry.

602
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,500
Thanks.

603
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay.

604
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Thank you very much.

605
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And there -- I've
got them right.

606
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay, thanks.

607
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,600
Okay.

608
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,000
So let's do elimination.

609
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
All right, it's going
to be simple, right?

610
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So I take two of this
row away from this row.

611
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,456
So this row stays
the same and two

612
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:28,000
of those come away from this.

613
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That leaves me with a zero and
a one and two of these away from

614
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,912
this is that what
you're getting --

615
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:40,688
after one elimination step --
Let me sort of separate the --

616
00:39:40,688 --> 00:39:44,000
the left half from
the right half.

617
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So two of that first row got
subtracted from the second row.

618
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,690
Now this is an upper
triangular form.

619
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,000
Gauss would quit, but
Jordan says keeps going.

620
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Use elimination upwards.

621
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,744
Subtract a multiple of
equation two from equation one

622
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:05,240
to get rid of the three.

623
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,000
So let's go the whole way.

624
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So now I'm going to -- this guy
is fine, but I'm going to --

625
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
what do I do now?

626
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
What's my final step that
produces the inverse?

627
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,149
I multiply this by
the right number

628
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,000
to get up to ther to
remove that three.

629
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,850
So I guess, I --
since this is a one,

630
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,000
there's the pivot sitting there.

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I multiply it by three
and subtract from that,

632
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,460
so what do I get?

633
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,000
I'll have one zero -- oh,
yeah that was my whole point.

634
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'll multiply this by three
and subtract from that,

635
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
which will give me seven.

636
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And I multiply this by three
and subtract from that,

637
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
which gives me a minus three.

638
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And what's my hope, belief?

639
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,768
Here I started with
A and the identity,

640
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:16,000
and I ended up with
the identity and who?

641
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That better be A inverse.

642
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's the Gauss Jordan idea.

643
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,555
Start with this long matrix,
double length A I, eliminate,

644
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:33,000
eliminate until this
part is down to I,

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
then this one will --
must be for some reason,

646
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and we've got to find the
reason -- must be A inverse.

647
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Shall I just check
that it works?

648
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let me just check that -- can I
multiply this matrix this part

649
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,375
times A, I'll carry A
over here and just do that

650
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,000
multiplication.

651
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You'll see I'll do it
the old fashioned way.

652
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Seven minus six is a one.

653
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,280
Twenty one minus
twenty one is a zero,

654
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,000
minus two plus two is a zero,
minus six plus seven is a one.

655
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,500
Check.

656
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,000
So that is the inverse.

657
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That's the Gauss-Jordan idea.

658
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So, you'll -- one of the
homework problems or more than

659
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
one for Wednesday will ask
you to go through those steps.

660
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,532
I think you just got to go
through Gauss Jordan a couple

661
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:41,000
of times, but I -- yeah --
just to see the mechanics.

662
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But the, important thing is,
why -- is, like, what happened?

663
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Why did we -- why did
we get A inverse there?

664
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,660
Let me ask you that.

665
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,000
We got -- so we take
-- We do row reduction,

666
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
we do elimination on this long
matrix A I until the first half

667
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Then a second half
is A inverse. is up.

668
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Well, how do I see that?

669
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Let me put up here
how I see that.

670
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So here's my Gauss Jordan thing,
and I'm doing stuff to it.

671
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So I'm -- well,
whole lot of E's.

672
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Remember those are those
elimination matrices.

673
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Those are the -- those are the
things that we figured out last

674
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
time.

675
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yes, that's what an elimination
step is it's in matrix form,

676
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm multiplying by some Es.

677
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,333
And the result -- well, so I'm
multiplying by a whole bunch

678
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:55,000
of Es.

679
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So, I get a -- can I call
the overall matrix E?

680
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
That's the elimination matrix,
the product of all those little

681
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,500
pieces.

682
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,000
What do I mean by little pieces?

683
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Well, there was an
elimination matrix

684
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
that subtracted two of
that away from that.

685
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,444
Then there was an
elimination matrix

686
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:22,000
that subtracted three
of that away from that.

687
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I guess in this
case, that was all.

688
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,840
So there were just two
Es in this case, one

689
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,996
that did this step and
one that did this step

690
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:38,000
and together they gave me
an E that does both steps.

691
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And the net result
was to get an I here.

692
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And you can tell me
what that has to be.

693
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This is, like, the
picture of what happened.

694
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,724
If E multiplied A,
whatever that E is --

695
00:44:55,724 --> 00:45:01,000
we never figured
it out in this way.

696
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,800
But whatever that E times
that E is, E times A is --

697
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,000
What's E times A?

698
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's I.

699
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
That E, whatever the heck it
was, multiplied A and produced

700
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So E must be -- E A equaling
I tells us what E is, I.

701
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,670
namely it is -- STUDENT:
It's the inverse of A.

702
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,000
STRANG: It's the inverse of A.

703
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Great.

704
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,284
And therefore, when the second
half, when E multiplies I,

705
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:44,090
it's E -- Put this A inverse.

706
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,000
You see the picture
looking that way?

707
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
E times A is the identity.

708
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,220
It tells us what E has to be.

709
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,000
It has to be the
inverse, and therefore,

710
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,904
on the right hand
side, where E --

711
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:57,875
where we just smartly
tucked on the identity,

712
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:04,000
it's turning in, step by step
-- It's turning into A inverse.

713
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There is the statement of
Gauss Jordan elimination.

714
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's how you find the inverse.

715
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,360
Where we can look at
it as elimination,

716
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,081
as solving n equations
at the same time -- --

717
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:28,915
and tacking on n columns,
solving those equations and up

718
00:46:28,915 --> 00:46:35,000
goes the n columns of
A inverse Okay, thanks.

719
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,150
See you on Wednesday.

720
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,000
