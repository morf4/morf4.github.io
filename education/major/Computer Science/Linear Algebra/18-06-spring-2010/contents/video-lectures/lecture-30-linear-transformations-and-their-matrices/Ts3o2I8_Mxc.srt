1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,130
OK, this is the lecture on
linear transformations.

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, linear algebra
courses used to begin with this

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
lecture, so you could say I'm
beginning this course again by

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
talking about linear
transformations.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In a lot of courses,
those come first before

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
matrices.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The idea of a linear
transformation makes sense

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
without a matrix,
and physicists and other --

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
some people like it better that
way.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
They don't like coordinates.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They don't want those numbers.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They want to see what's going
on with the whole space.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But, for most of us,
in the end, if we're going to

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,349
compute anything,
we introduce coordinates,

15
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,000
and then every linear
transformation will lead us to a

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
matrix.
And then, to all the things
that we've done about null space

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and row space,
and determinant,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and eigenvalues -- all will
come from the matrix.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But, behind it -- in other
words, behind this is the idea

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of a linear transformation.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let me give an example of a
linear transformation.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, example.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Example one.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,190
A projection.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,000
I can describe a projection
without telling you any matrix,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
anything about any matrix.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can describe a projection,
say, this will be a linear

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
transformation that takes,
say, all of R^2,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
every vector in the plane,
into a vector in the plane.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,030
And this is the way people
describe, a mapping.

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,000
It takes every vector,
and so, by what rule?

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So, what's the rule,
is, I take a -- so here's the

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,500
plane, this is going to be my
line, my line through my line,

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,000
and I'm going to project every
vector onto that line.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,060
So if I take a vector like b --
or let me call the vector v for

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,000
the moment -- the projection --
the linear transformation is

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
going to produce this vector as
T(v).

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So T -- it's like a function.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Exactly like a function.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You give me an input,
the transformation produces the

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
output.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So transformation,
sometimes the word map,

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,980
or mapping is used.

44
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,000
A map between inputs and
outputs.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So this is one particular map,
this is one example,

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a projection that takes every
vector -- here,

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
let me do another vector v,
or let me do this vector w,

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
what is T(w)?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You see?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There are no coordinates here.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've drawn those axes,
but I'm sorry I drew them,

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to remove them,
that's the whole point,

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
is that we don't need axes,
we just need -- so guts -- get

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
it out of there,
I'm not a physicist,

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so I draw those axes.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So the input is w,
the output of the projection

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is, project on that line,
T(w).

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
OK.
Now, I could think of a lot of
transformations T.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But, in this linear algebra
course, I want it to be a linear

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
transformation.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So here are the rules for a
linear transformation.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Here, see, exactly,
the two operations that we can

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
do on vectors,
adding and multiplying by

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
scalars, the transformation does
something special with respect

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to those operations.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, for example,
the projection is a linear

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
transformation because --
for example,

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
if I wanted to check that one,
if I took v to be twice as

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
long, the projection would be
twice as long.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If I took v to be minus -- if I
changed from v to minus v,

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the projection would change to
a minus.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So c equal to two,
c equal minus one,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
any c is OK.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So you see that actually,
those combine,

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can combine those into one
statement.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What the transformation does to
any linear combination,

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
it must produce the same
combination of T(v) and T(w).

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's think about some --
I mean, it's like,

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
not hard to decide,
is a transformation linear or

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is it not.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,250
Let me give you an example so
you can tell me the answer.

82
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:52,000
Suppose my transformation is --
here's another example two.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Shift the whole plane.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So here are all my vectors,
my plane, and every vector v in

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the plane, I shift it over by,
let's say, three by some vector

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
v0.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Shift whole plane by v0.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So every vector in the plane --
this was v, T(v) will be v+v0.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's T(v).

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here's v0.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's the typical v.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And there's T(v).

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You see what this
transformation does?

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Takes this vector and adds to
it.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Adds a fixed vector to it.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, that seems like a pretty
reasonable, simple

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
transformation,
but is it linear?

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The answer is no,
it's not linear.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,540
Which law is broken?

100
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe both laws are broken.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's see.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,820
If I double the length of v,
does the transformation produce

103
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,000
something double -- do I double
T(v)?

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If I double the length of v,
in this transformation,

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm just adding on the same one
-- same v0, not two v0s,

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
but only one v0 for every
vector, so I don't get two times

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the transform.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,230
Do you see what I'm saying?

110
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,000
That if I double this,
then the transformation starts

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,409
there and only goes one v0 out
and doesn't double T(v).

112
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,000
In fact, a linear
transformation -- what is T of

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
zero?
That's just like a special
case, but really worth noticing.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The zero vector in a linear
transformation must get

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
transformed to zero.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It can't move,
because, take any vector V here

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
--
well, so you can see why T of

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
zero is zero.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Take v to be the zero vector,
take c to be three.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then we'd have T of zero vector
equaling three T of zero vector,

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
the T of zero has to be zero.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
OK.
So, this example is really a
non-example.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Shifting the whole plane is not
a linear transformation.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or if I cooked up some formula
that involved squaring,

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
or the transformation that,
also non-example,

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
how about the transformation
that, takes any vector and

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
produces its length?

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So there's a transformation
that takes any vector,

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
say, any vector in R^3,
let me just -- I'll just get a

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
chance to use this notation
again.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Suppose I think of the
transformation that takes any

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
vector in R^3 and produces this
number.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So that, I could say,
is a member of R^1,

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
for example,
if I wanted.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Or just real numbers.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's certainly not linear.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's true that the zero vector
goes to zero.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But if I double a vector,
it does double the length,

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that's true.

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But suppose I multiply a vector
by minus two.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What happens to its length?

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It just doubles.

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,590
It doesn't get multiplied by
minus two.

144
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,000
So when c is minus two in my
requirement, I'm not satisfying

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that requirement.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So T of minus v is not minus v
-- minus, the length,

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
it's just the length.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OK, so that's another
non-example.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Projection was an example,
let me give you another

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
example.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can stay here and have a --
this will be an example that is

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a linear transformation,
a rotation.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Rotation by -- what shall we
say?

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
By 45 degrees.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OK?

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,320
So again, let me choose this,
this will be a mapping,

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,000
from the whole plane of
vectors, into the whole plane of

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
vectors, and it just -- here is
the input vector v,

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the output vector foam this
45 degree rotation is just

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
rotate that thing by 45 degrees,
T(v).

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So every vector got rotated.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You see that I can describe
this without any coordinates.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And see that it's linear.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If I doubled v,
the rotation would just be

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
twice as far out.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If I had v+w,
and if I rotated each of them

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and added, the answer's the same
as if I add and then rotate.

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's what the linear
transformation is.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
OK, so those are two examples.

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Two examples,
projection and rotation,

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and I could invent more that
are linear transformations where

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I haven't told you a matrix yet.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,250
Actually, the book has a
picture of the action of linear

174
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,000
transformations -- actually,
the cover of the book has it.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,100
So, in this section seven point
one, we can think of a --

176
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,000
actually, here let's take this
linear transformation,

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
rotation, suppose I have,
as the cover of the book has,

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a house in R^2.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So instead of this,
let me take a small house in

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
R^2.
So that's a whole lot of
points.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,400
The idea is,
with this linear

182
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,000
transformation,
that I can see what it does to

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
everything at once.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't have to just take one
vector at a time and see what T

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
of V is, I can take all the
vectors on the outline of the

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
house, and see where they all
go.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
In fact, that will show me
where the whole house goes.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So what will happen with this
particular linear

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
transformation?

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The whole house will rotate,
so the result,

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
if I can draw it,
will be, the house will be

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
sitting there.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
OK.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And, but suppose I give some
other examples.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, let me give some examples
that involve a matrix.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Example three -- and this is
important -- coming from a

197
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
matrix at -- we always call A.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So the transformation will be,
multiply by A.

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,220
There is a linear
transformation.

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,000
And a whole family of them,
because every matrix produces a

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
transformation by this simple
rule, just multiply every vector

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
by that matrix,
and it's linear,

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
right?
Linear, I have to check that
A(v) -- A times v plus w equals

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Av plus A w, which is fine,
and I have to check that A

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
times vc equals c A(v).

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,810
Check.

207
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,000
Those are fine.

208
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,290
So there is a linear
transformation.

209
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,000
And if I take my favorite
matrix A, and I apply it to all

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
vectors in the plane,
it will produce a bunch of

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
outputs.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
See, the idea is now worth
thinking of, like,

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the big picture.

214
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The whole plane is transformed
by matrix multiplication.

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Every vector in the plane gets
multiplied by A.

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's take an example,
and see what happens to the

217
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
vectors of the house.

218
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,030
So this is still a
transformation from plane to

219
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,070
plane, and let me take a
particular matrix A -- well,

220
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,000
if I cooked up a rotation
matrix, this would be the right

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
picture.

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If I cooked up a projection
matrix, the projection would be

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,260
the picture.

224
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,480
Let me just take some other
matrix.

225
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,000
Let me take the matrix one zero
zero minus one.

226
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What happens to the house,
to all vectors,

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and in particular,
we can sort of visualize it if

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
we look at the house --
so the house is not rotated any

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
more, what do I get?

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What happens to all the vectors
if I do this transformation?

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I multiply by this matrix.

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, of course,
it's an easy matrix,

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it's diagonal.

234
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The x component stays the same,
the y component reverses sign,

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
so that like the roof of that
house, the point,

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the tip of the roof,
has an x component which stays

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the same, but its y component
reverses, and it's down here.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,170
And, of course,
what we get is,

239
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,000
the house is,
like, upside down.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Now, I have to put -- where
does the door go?

241
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I guess the door goes upside
down there, right?

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So here's the input,
here's the input house,

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and this is the output.

244
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
OK.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This idea of a linear
transformation is like kind of

246
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the abstract description of
matrix multiplication.

247
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And what's our goal here?

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Our goal is to understand
linear transformations,

249
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and the way to understand them
is to find the matrix that lies

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
behind them.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's really the idea.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Find the matrix that lies
behind them.

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Um, and to do that,
we have to bring in

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
coordinates.

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We have to choose a basis.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So let me point out what's the
story -- if we have a linear

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
transformation -- so start with
-- start.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Suppose we have a linear
transformation.

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,030
Let -- from now on,
let T stand for linear

260
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,000
transformations.

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I won't be interested in the
nonlinear ones.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Only linear transformations I'm
interested in.

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,970
OK.

264
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,000
I start with a linear
transformation T.

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let's suppose its inputs are
vectors in R^3.

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OK?
And suppose its outputs are
vectors in R^2,

267
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
for example.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,000
OK.
What's an example of such a
transformation,

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
just before I go any further?

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Any matrix of the right size
will do this.

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So what would be the right
shape of a matrix?

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So, for example -- I'm wanting
to give you an example,

273
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
just because,
here, I'm thinking of

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
transformations that take
three-dimensional space to

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,740
two-dimensional space.

276
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,000
And I want them to be linear,
and the easy way to invent them

277
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
is a matrix multiplication.

278
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So example, T of v should be
any A v.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Those transformations are
linear, that's what 18.06 is

280
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,180
about.

281
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,550
And A should be what size,
what shape of matrix should

282
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,000
that be?

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I want V to have three
components, because this is what

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the inputs have -- so here's the
input in R^3,

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and here's the output in R^2.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So what shape of matrix?

287
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So this should be,
I guess, a two by three matrix?

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right?

289
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A two by three matrix.

290
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
A two by three matrix,
we'll multiply a vector in R^3

291
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
-- you see I'm moving to
coordinates so quickly,

292
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,260
I'm not a true physicist here.

293
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,000
A two by three matrix,
we'll multiply a vector in R^3

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
an produce an output in R^2,
and it will be a linear

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
transformation,
and OK.

296
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So there's a whole lot of
examples, every two by three

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
matrix give me an example,
and basically,

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to show you that there
are no other examples.

299
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Every linear transformation is
associated with a matrix.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Now, let me come back to the
idea of linear transformation.

301
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Suppose I've got this linear
transformation in my mind,

302
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and I want to tell you what it
is.

303
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Suppose I tell you what the
transformation does to one

304
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
vector.

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,000
OK.
You know one thing,
then.

306
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,000
All right.

307
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So this is like the -- what I'm
speaking about now is,

308
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,590
how much information is needed
to know the transformation?

309
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,000
By knowing T,
I -- to know T of v for all v.

310
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
All inputs.

311
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How much information do I have
to give you so that you know

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what the transformation does to
every vector?

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
OK, I could tell you what the
transformation -- so I could

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
take a vector v1,
one particular vector,

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
tell you what the
transformation does to it --

316
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
fine.

317
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But now you only know what the
transformation does to one

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000
vector.
So you say, OK,
that's not enough,

319
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
tell me what it does to another
vector.

320
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So I say, OK,
give me a vector,

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you give me a vector v2,
and we see, what does the

322
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
transformation do to v2?

323
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Now, you only know -- or do you
only know what the

324
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
transformation does to two
vectors?

325
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Have I got to ask you -- answer
you about every vector in the

326
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
whole input space,
or can you, knowing what it

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
does to v1 and v2,
how much do you now know about

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,980
the transformation?

329
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,000
You know what the
transformation does to a larger

330
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
bunch of vectors than just these
two, because you know what it

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,570
does to every linear
combination.

332
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,000
You know what it does,
now, to the whole plane of

333
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
vectors, with bases v1 and v2.

334
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm assuming v1 and v2 were
independent.

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If they were dependent,
if v2 was six times v1,

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
then I didn't give you any new
information in T of v2,

337
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
you already knew it would be
six times T of v1.

338
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
So you can see what I'd headed
for.

339
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If I know what the
transformation does to every

340
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
vector in a basis,
then I know everything.

341
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So the information needed to
know T of v for all inputs is T

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
of v1, T of v2,
up to T of vm,

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
let's say, or vn,
for any basis -- for a basis v1

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,730
up to vn.

345
00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:05,000
This is a base for any -- can I
call it an input basis?

346
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's a basis for the space of
inputs.

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The things that T is acting on.

348
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You see this point,
that if I have a basis for the

349
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
input space, and I tell you what
the transformation does to every

350
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
one of those basis vectors,
that is all I'm allowed to tell

351
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
you, and it's enough to know T
of v for all v-s,

352
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
because why?

353
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,530
Because every v is some
combination of these basis

354
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:56,650
vectors, c1v1+...+cnvn,
that's what a basis is,

355
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,000
right?

356
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It spans the space.

357
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And if I know what T does to
this, and what T does to v2,

358
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and what T does to vn,
then I know what T does to V.

359
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
By this linearity,
it has to be c1 T of v1 plus O

360
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
one plus cn T of vn.

361
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
There's no choice.

362
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So, the point of this comment
is that if I know what T does to

363
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a basis, to each vector in a
basis, then I know the linear

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
transformation.

365
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The property of linearity tells
me all the other vectors.

366
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
All the other outputs.

367
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,000
OK.
So now, we got -- so that light
we now see, what do we really

368
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
need in a linear transformation,
and we're ready to go to a

369
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
matrix.
OK.

370
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What's the step now that takes
us from a linear transformation

371
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
that's free of coordinates to a
matrix that's been created with

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
respect to coordinates?

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The matrix is going to come
from the coordinate system.

374
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
These are the coordinates.

375
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Coordinates mean a basis is
decided.

376
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Once you decide on a basis --
this is where coordinates come

377
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000
from.
You decide on a basis,
then every vector,

378
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,500
these are the coordinates in
that basis.

379
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,000
There is one and only one way
to express v as a combination of

380
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the basis vectors,
and the numbers you need in

381
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
that combination are the
coordinates.

382
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me write that down.

383
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So what are coordinates?

384
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Coordinates come from a basis.

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Coordinates come from a basis.

386
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The coordinates of v,
the coordinates of v are these

387
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
numbers that tell you how much
of each basis vector is in v.

388
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
If I change the basis,
I change the coordinates,

389
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
right?

390
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Now, we have always been
assuming that were working with

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
a standard basis,
right?

392
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The basis we don't even think
about this stuff,

393
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because if I give you the
vector v equals three two four,

394
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
you have been assuming
completely -- and probably

395
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
rightly -- that I had in mind
the standard basis,

396
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that this vector was three
times the first coordinate

397
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
vector, and two times the
second, and four times the

398
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
third.

399
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But you're not entitled -- I
might have had some other basis

400
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
in mind.

401
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,830
This is like the standard
basis.

402
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:32,000
And then the coordinates are
sitting right there in the

403
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
vector.

404
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I could have chosen a
different basis,

405
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
like I might have had
eigenvectors of a matrix,

406
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,420
and I might have said,
OK, that's a great basis,

407
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll use the eigenvectors of
this matrix as my basis vectors.

408
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Which are not necessarily these
three, but some other basis.

409
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So that was an example,
this is the real thing,

410
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the coordinates are these
numbers, I'll circle them again,

411
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the amounts of each basis.

412
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
OK.

413
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, if I want to create a
matrix that describes a linear

414
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,910
transformation,
now I'm ready to do that.

415
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,000
OK, OK.

416
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So now what I plan to do is
construct the matrix A that

417
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
represents, or tells me about,
a linear transformation,

418
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
linear transformation T.

419
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,000
OK.
So I really start with the
transformation --

420
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,970
whether it's a projection or a
rotation, or some strange

421
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,000
movement of this house in the
plane, or some transformation

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,850
from n-dimensional space to --
or m-dimensional space to

423
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,000
n-dimensional space.
n to m, I guess.

424
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Usually, we'll have T,
we'll somehow transform

425
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
n-dimensional space to
m-dimensional space,

426
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and the whole point is that if
I have a basis for n-dimensional

427
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,480
space -- I guess I need two
bases, really.

428
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,000
I need an input basis to
describe the inputs,

429
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and I need an output basis to
give me coordinates -- to give

430
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
me some numbers for the output.

431
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I've got to choose two
bases.

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Choose a basis v1 up to vn for
the inputs, for the inputs in --

433
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,170
they came from R^n.

434
00:30:53,170 --> 00:31:00,000
So the transformation is taking
every n-dimensional vector into

435
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
some m-dimensional vector.

436
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And I have to choose a basis,
and I'll call them w1 up to wn,

437
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
for the outputs.

438
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Those are guys in R^m.

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Once I've chosen the basis,
that settles the matrix -- I

440
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
now working with coordinates.

441
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Every vector in R^n,
every input vector has some

442
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
coordinates.

443
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So here's what I do,
here's what I do.

444
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Can I say it in words?

445
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I take a vector v.

446
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I express it in its basis,
in the basis,

447
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
so I get its coordinates.

448
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Then I'm going to multiply
those coordinates by the right

449
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
matrix A, and that will give me
the coordinates of the output in

450
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the output basis.

451
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'd better write that down,
that was a mouthful.

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What I want -- I want a matrix
A that does what the linear

453
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
transformation does.

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And it does it with respecting
these bases.

455
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So I want the matrix to be --
well, let's suppose -- look,

456
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,500
let me take an example.

457
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Let me take the projection
example.

458
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The projection example.

459
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Suppose I take -- because we've
got that -- we've got that

460
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
projection in mind -- I can fit
in here.

461
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Here's the projection example.

462
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So the projection example,
I'm thinking of n and m as two.

463
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The transformation takes the
plane, takes every vector in the

464
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
plane, and, let me draw the
plane, just so we remember it's

465
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
a plane -- and there's the thing
that I'm projecting onto,

466
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that's the line I'm projecting
onto -- so the transformation

467
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,160
takes every vector in the plane
and projects it onto that line.

468
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,000
So this is projection,
so I'm going to do projection.

469
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,000
OK.
But, I'm going to choose a
basis that I like better than

470
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,220
the standard basis.

471
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,000
My basis -- in fact,
I'll choose the same basis for

472
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
inputs and for outputs,
and the basis will be -- my

473
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
first basis vector will be right
on the line.

474
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
There's my first basis vector.

475
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Say, a unit vector,
on the line.

476
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And my second basis vector will
be a unit vector perpendicular

477
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
to that line.

478
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I'm going to choose that as
the output basis,

479
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
also.
And I'm going to ask you,
what's the matrix?

480
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What's the matrix?

481
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
How do I describe this
transformation of projection

482
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
with respect to this basis?

483
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
OK?

484
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So what's the rule?

485
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,530
I take any vector v,
it's some combination of the

486
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:34,000
first basis ve- vector,
and the second basis vector.

487
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Now, what is T of v?

488
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Suppose the input is -- well,
suppose the input is v1.

489
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What's the output?
v1, right?

490
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The projection leaves this one
alone.

491
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So we know what the projection
does to this first basis vector,

492
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
this guy, it leaves it.

493
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What does the projection do to
the second basis vector?

494
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It kills it,
sends it to zero.

495
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So what does the projection do
to a combination?

496
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It kills this part,
and this part,

497
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
it leaves alone.

498
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Now, all I want to do is find
the matrix.

499
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I now want to find the matrix
that takes an input,

500
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
c1 c2, the coordinates,
and gives me the output,

501
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
c1 0.

502
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You see that in this basis,
the coordinates of the input

503
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,330
were c1, c2, and the coordinates
of the output are c1,

504
00:35:49,330 --> 00:00:00,000


505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:35:49,000


506
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And of course,
not hard to find a matrix that

507
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
will do that.

508
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The matrix that will do that is
the matrix one,

509
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
zero, zero, zero.

510
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Because if I multiply input by
that matrix A -- this is A times

511
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
input coordinates -- and I'm
hoping to get the output

512
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
coordinates.

513
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And what do I get from that
multiplication?

514
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,370
I get the right answer,
c1 and zero.

515
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,000
So what's the point?

516
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So the first point is,
there's a matrix that does the

517
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
job.

518
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
If there's a linear
transformation out there,

519
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
coordinate-free,
no coordinates,

520
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and then I choose a basis for
the inputs, and I choose a basis

521
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,440
for the outputs,
then there's a matrix that does

522
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,000
the job.

523
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And what's the job?

524
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It multiplies the input
coordinates and produces the

525
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
output coordinates.

526
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Now, in this example -- let me
repeat, I chose the input basis

527
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
was the same as the output
basis.

528
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The input basis and output
basis were both along the line,

529
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and perpendicular to the line.

530
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
They're actually the
eigenvectors of the projection.

531
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And, as a result,
the matrix came out diagonal.

532
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In fact, it came out to be
lambda.

533
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
This is like,
the good basis.

534
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So the good -- the eigenvector
basis is the good basis,

535
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
it leads to the matrix --
the diagonal matrix of

536
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
eigenvalues lambda,
and just as in this example,

537
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of this linear

538
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
transformation were along the
line, and perpendicular.

539
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The eigenvalues were one and
zero, and that's the matrix that

540
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
we got.

541
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
OK.

542
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So that's a,
like, the great choice of

543
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
matrix, that's the choice a
physicist would do when he had

544
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to finally -- he or she had to
finally bring coordinates in

545
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
unwillingly, the coordinates to
be chosen, the good coordinates

546
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
are the eigenvectors,
because, if I did this

547
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
projection in the standard basis
-- which I could do,

548
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
right?

549
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,460
I could do the whole thing in
the standard basis -- I better

550
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,000
try, if I can do that.

551
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What are we calling -- so I'll
have to tell you now which line

552
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
we're projecting on.

553
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Say, the 45 degree line.

554
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So say we're projecting onto 45
degree line, and we use not the

555
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
eigenvector basis,
but the standard basis.

556
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The standard basis,
v1, is one, zero,

557
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and v2 is zero,
one.

558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And again, I'll use the same
basis for the outputs.

559
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Then I have to do this -- I can
find a matrix,

560
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
it will be the matrix that we
would always think of,

561
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
it would be the projection
matrix.

562
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It will be, actually,
it's the matrix that we learned

563
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
about in chapter four,
it's what I call the matrix --

564
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,520
do you remember,
P was A, A transpose over A

565
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,000
transpose A?

566
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And I think,
in this example,

567
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
it will come out,
one-half, one-half,

568
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,760
one-half, one-half.

569
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,000
I believe that's the matrix
that comes from our formula.

570
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And that's the matrix that will
do the job.

571
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
If I give you this input,
one, zero, what's the output?

572
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The output is one-half,
one-half.

573
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And that should be the right
projection.

574
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,330
And if I give you the input
zero, one, the output is,

575
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:40,000
again, one-half,
one-half, again the projection.

576
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So that's the matrix,
but not diagonal of course,

577
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
because we didn't choose a
great basis, we just chose the

578
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
handiest basis.

579
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Well, so the course has
practically been about the

580
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
handiest basis,
and just dealing with the

581
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
matrix that we got.

582
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And it's not that bad a matrix,
it's symmetric,

583
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and it has this P squared equal
P property, all those things are

584
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
good.

585
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But in the best basis,
it's easy to see that P squared

586
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
equals P, and it's symmetric,
and it's diagonal.

587
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So that's the idea then,
is, do you see now how I'm

588
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
associating a matrix to the
transformation?

589
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'd better write the rule down,
I'd better write the rule down.

590
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The rule to find the matrix A.

591
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
All right, first column.

592
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So, a rule to find A,
we're given the bases.

593
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Of course, we don't -- because
there's no way we could

594
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
construct the matrix until we're
told what the bases are.

595
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,340
So we're given the input basis,
and the output basis,

596
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,000
v1 to vn, w1 to wm.

597
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Those are given.

598
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Now, in the first column of A,
how do I find that column?

599
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The first column of the matrix.

600
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So that should tell me what
happens to the first basis

601
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
vector.

602
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So the rule is,
apply the linear transformation

603
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
to v1.

604
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
To the first basis vector.

605
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And then, I'll write it -- so
that's the output,

606
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
right?

607
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,460
The input is v1,
what's the output?

608
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,550
The output is in the output
space, it's some combination of

609
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,000
these guys, and it's that
combination that goes into the

610
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
first column -- so,
let me -- I'll put this word --

611
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
right, I'll say it in words
again.

612
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,770
How to find this matrix.

613
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,000
Take the first basis vector.

614
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Apply the transformation,
then it's in the output space,

615
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
T of v1, so it's some
combination of these outputs,

616
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
this output basis.

617
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So that combination,
the coefficients in that

618
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
combination will be the first
column -- so a1,

619
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
a row 2, column 1,
w2, am1, wm.

620
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
There are the numbers in the
first column of the matrix.

621
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Let me make the point by doing
the second column.

622
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Second column of A.

623
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
What's the idea,
now?

624
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I take the second basis vector,
I apply the transformation to

625
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it, that's in -- now I get an
output, so it's some combination

626
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:11,000
in the output basis --
and that combination is the

627
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
bunch of numbers that should go
in the second column of the

628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
matrix.

629
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
OK.
And so forth.

630
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So I get a matrix,
and the matrix I get does the

631
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,430
right job.

632
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:32,000
Now, the matrix constructed
that way, and following the

633
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
rules of matrix multiplication.

634
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The result will be that if I
give you the input coordinates,

635
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and I multiply by the matrix,
so the outcome of all this is A

636
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
times the input coordinates
correctly reproduces the output

637
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
coordinates.

638
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Why is this right?

639
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Let me just check the first
column.

640
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Suppose the input coordinates
are one and all zeros.

641
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What does that mean?

642
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
What's the input?

643
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
If the input coordinates are
one and other -- and the rest

644
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
zeros, then the input is v1,
right?

645
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's the vector that has
coordinates one and all zeros.

646
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
OK?

647
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
When I multiply A by the one
and all zeros,

648
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'll get the first column of A,
I'll get these numbers.

649
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And, sure enough,
those are the output

650
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,190
coordinates for T of v1.

651
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,000
So we made it right on the
first column,

652
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
we made it right on the second
column, we made it right on all

653
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the basis vectors,
and then it has to be right on

654
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,420
every vector.

655
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:49,000
OK.

656
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So there is a picture of the
matrix for a linear

657
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
transformation.

658
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,970
Finally, let me give you
another -- a different linear

659
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,000
transformation.

660
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The linear transformation that
takes the derivative.

661
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's a linear transformation.

662
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Suppose the input space is all
combination c1 plus c2x plus c3

663
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
x squared.

664
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So the basis is these simple
functions.

665
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Then what's the output?

666
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Is the derivative.

667
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The output is the derivative,
so the output is c2+2c3 x.

668
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And let's take as output basis,
the vectors one and x.

669
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So we're going from a
three-dimensional space of

670
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
inputs to a two-dimensional
space of outputs by the

671
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
derivative.

672
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:07,560
And I don't know if you ever
thought that the derivative is

673
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,000
linear.

674
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But if it weren't linear,
taking derivatives would take

675
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
forever, right?

676
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
We are able to compute
derivatives of functions exactly

677
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
because we know it's a linear
transformation,

678
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
so that if we learn the
derivatives of a few functions,

679
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
like sine x and cos x and e to
the x, and another little short

680
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
list, then we can take all their
combinations and we can do all

681
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
the derivatives.

682
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
OK, now what's the matrix?

683
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What's the matrix?

684
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I want the matrix to
multiply these input vectors --

685
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
input coordinates,
and give these output

686
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
coordinates.

687
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So I just think,
OK, what's the matrix that does

688
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
it?

689
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,500
I can follow my rule of
construction,

690
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,000
or I can see what the matrix
is.

691
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It should be a two by three
matrix, right?

692
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And the matrix -- so I'm just
figuring out,

693
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
what do I want?

694
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,750
No, I'll -- let me write it
here.

695
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,000
What do I want from my matrix?

696
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
What should that matrix do?

697
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,140
Well, I want to get c2 in the
first output,

698
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,000
so zero, one,
zero will do it.

699
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I want to get two c3,
so zero, zero,

700
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,210
two will do it.

701
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,000
That's the matrix for this
linear transformation with those

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
bases and those coordinates.

703
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You see, it just clicks,
and the whole point is that the

704
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
inverse matrix gives the inverse
to the linear transformation,

705
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
that the product of two
matrices gives the right matrix

706
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
for the product of two
transformations --

707
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:03,000
matrix multiplication really
came from linear

708
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
transformations.

709
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'd better pick up on that
theme Monday after Thanksgiving.

710
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I hope you have a great
holiday.

711
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I hope Indian summer keeps
going.

712
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
OK, see you on Monday.
