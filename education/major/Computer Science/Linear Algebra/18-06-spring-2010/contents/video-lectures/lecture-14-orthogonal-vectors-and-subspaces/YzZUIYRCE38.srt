1
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,000
OK.
cameras are rolling.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is lecture fourteen,
starting a new chapter.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Chapter about orthogonality.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,010
What it means for vectors to be
orthogonal.

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,000
What it means for subspaces to
be orthogonal.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What it means for bases to be
orthogonal.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So ninety degrees,
this is a ninety-degree

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
chapter.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So what does it mean -- let me
jump to subspaces.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Because I've drawn here the big
picture.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
This is the 18.06 picture here.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
And hold it down,
guys.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So this is the picture and we
know a lot about that picture

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
already.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We know the dimension of every
subspace.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We know that these dimensions
are r and n-r.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We know that these dimensions
are r and m-r.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What I want to show now is what
this figure is saying,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that the angle --
the figure is just my attempt

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to draw what I'm now going to
say, that the angle between

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
these subspaces is ninety
degrees.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And the angle between these
subspaces is ninety degrees.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now I have to say what does
that mean?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What does it mean for subspaces
to be orthogonal?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I hope you appreciate the
beauty of this picture,

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that that those subspaces are
going to come out to be

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
orthogonal.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Those two and also those two.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So that's like one point,
one important point to step

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
forward in understanding those
subspaces.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We knew what each subspace was
like, we could compute bases for

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,980
them.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,170
Now we know more.

34
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,000
Or we will in a few minutes.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
OK.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have to say first of all what
does it mean for two vectors to

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
be orthogonal?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So let me start with that.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Orthogonal vectors.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The word orthogonal is -- is
just another word for

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
perpendicular.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It means that in n-dimensional
space the angle between those

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,970
vectors is ninety degrees.

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,000
It means that they form a right
triangle.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It even means that the going
way back to the Greeks that this

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
angle that this triangle a
vector x, a vector x,

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and a vector x+y --
of course that'll be the

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
hypotenuse, so what was it the
Greeks figured out and it's

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
neat.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's the fact that the -- so
these are orthogonal,

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
this is a right angle,
if -- so let me put the great

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,080
name down, Pythagoras,
I'm looking for -- what I

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
looking for?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm looking for the condition
if you give me two vectors,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how do I know if they're
orthogonal?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How can I tell two
perpendicular vectors?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And actually you probably know
the answer.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let me write the answer down.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Orthogonal vectors,
what's the test for

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
orthogonality?

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I take the dot product which I
tend to write as x transpose y,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
because that's a row times a
column, and that matrix

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
multiplication just gives me the
right thing, that x1y1+x2y2 and

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
so on, so these vectors are
orthogonal if this result x

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
transpose y is zero.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's the test.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
OK.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Can I connect that to other
things?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean -- it's just beautiful
that here we have we're in n

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
dimensions, we've got a couple
of vectors, we want to know the

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,430
angle between them,
and the right thing to look at

72
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,050
is the simplest thing that you
could imagine,

73
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,000
the dot product.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OK.
Now why?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,550
So I'm answering the question
now why --

76
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,000
let's add some justification to
this fact, that's the test.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OK, so Pythagoras would say
we've got a right triangle,

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
if that length squared plus
that length squared equals that

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
length squared.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK, can I write it as x squared
plus y squared equals x plus y

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
squared?

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now don't, please don't think
that this is always true.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is only going to be true
in this -- it's going to be

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
equivalent to orthogonality.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For other triangles of course,
it's not true.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
For other triangles it's not.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But for a right triangle
somehow that fact should connect

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to that fact.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Can we just make that
connection?

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's the connection between
this test for orthogonality and

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
this statement of orthogonality?

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, I guess I have to say
what is the length squared?

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So let's continue on the board
underneath with that equation.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Give me another way to express
the length squared of a vector.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And let me just give you a
vector.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The vector one,
two, three.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,810
That's in three dimensions.

98
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,000
What is the length squared of
the vector x equal one,

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
two, three?

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So how do you find the length
squared?

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, really you just,
you want the length of that

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
vector that goes along one --
up two, and out three -- and

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we'll come back to that right
triangle stuff.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The length squared is exactly x
transpose x.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Whenever I see x transpose x,
I know I've got a number that's

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,830
positive.

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a length squared unless it
--

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
unless x happens to be the zero
vector, that's the one case

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,070
where the length is zero.

110
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,000
So right -- this is just x1
squared plus x2 squared plus so

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
on, plus xn squared.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,520
So one -- in the example I gave
you what was the length squared

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,000
of that vector one,
two, three?

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,890
So you square those,
you get one,

115
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,000
four and nine,
you add, you get fourteen.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So the vector one,
two, three has length fourteen.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So let me just put down a
vector here.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let x be the vector one,
two, three.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let me cook up a vector that's
orthogonal to it.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So what's the vector that's
orthogonal?

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,450
So right down here,
x squared is one plus four plus

122
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:42,000
nine, fourteen,
let me cook up a vector that's

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
orthogonal to it,
we'll get right that that --

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
those two vectors are
orthogonal, the length of y

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
squared is five,
and x plus y is one and two

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
making three,
two and minus one making one,

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
three and zero making three,
and the length of this squared

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
is nine plus one plus nine,
nineteen.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And sure enough,
I haven't proved anything.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've just like checked to see
that my test x transpose y

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
equals zero, which is true,
right?

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Everybody sees that x transpose
y is zero here?

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's maybe the main point.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That you should get really
quick at doing x transpose y,

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
so it's just this plus this
plus this and that's zero.

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And sure enough,
that clicks with fourteen plus

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
five agreeing with nineteen.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Now let me just do that in
letters.

139
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
So that's y transpose y.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And this is x plus y transpose
x plus y.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
OK.
So I'm looking,
again, this isn't always true.

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I repeat.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is going to be true when
we have a right angle.

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And let's just -- well,
of course, I'm just going to

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
simplify this stuff here.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There's an x transpose x there.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And there's a y transpose y
there.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And there's an x transpose y.

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,490
And there's a y transpose x.

150
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,310
I knew I could do that
simplification because I'm just

151
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,000
doing matrix multiplication and
I've just followed the rules.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
OK.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,200
So x transpose x-s cancel.

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Y transpose y-s cancel.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And what about these guys?

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,650
What can you tell me about the
inner product of x with y and

157
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,000
the inner product of y with x?

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is there a difference?

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think if we --
while we're doing real vectors,

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
which is all we're doing now,
there isn't a difference,

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
there's no difference.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,420
If I take x transpose y,
that'll give me zero,

163
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,680
if I took y transpose x I would
have the same x1y1 and x2y2 and

164
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,000
x3y3, it would be the same,
so this is --

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
this is the same as that,
this is really I'll knock that

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
guy out and say two of these.

167
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So actually that's the -- this
equation boiled down to this

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
thing being zero.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right?
Everything else canceled and
this equation boiled down to

170
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,000
that one.

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So that's really all I wanted.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I just wanted to check that
Pythagoras for a right triangle

173
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,850
led me to this -- of course I
cancel the two now.

174
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,920
No problem.

175
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,000
To x transpose y equals zero as
the test.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Fair enough.

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
OK.

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You knew it was coming.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The dot product of orthogonal
vectors is zero.

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's just -- I just want to say
that's really neat.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,430
That it comes out so well.

182
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,000
All right.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now what about -- so now I know
if two -- when two vectors are

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,290
orthogonal.

185
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,000
By the way, what about if one
of these guys is the zero

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
vector?

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Suppose x is the zero vector,
and y is whatever.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Are they orthogonal?

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,190
Sure.

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,000
In math the one thing about
math is you're supposed to

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
follow the rules.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So you're supposed to -- if x
is the zero vector,

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you're supposed to take the
zero vector dotted with y and of

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
course you always get zero.

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So just so we're all sure,
the zero vector is orthogonal

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to everybody.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But what I want to -- what I
now want to think about is

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
subspaces.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What does it mean for me to say
that some subspace is orthogonal

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to some other subspace?

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So OK.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,640
Now I've got to write this
down.

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,000
So because we're defining
definition of subspace S is

204
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
orthogonal so to subspace let's
say T, so I've got a couple of

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
subspaces.

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And what should it mean for
those guys to be orthogonal?

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's just sort of what's the
natural extension from

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
orthogonal vectors to orthogonal
subspaces?

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, and in particular,
let's think of some orthogonal

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
subspaces, like this wall.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's say in three dimensions.

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So the blackboard extended to
infinity, right,

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is a --
is a subspace,

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
a plane, a two-dimensional
subspace.

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a little bumpy but anyway,
it's a -- think of it as a

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
subspace, let me take the floor
as another subspace.

217
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Again, it's not a great
subspace, MIT only built it like

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,420
so-so, but I'll put the origin
right here.

219
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,000
So the origin of the world is
right there.

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
OK.

221
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thereby giving linear algebra
its proper importance in this.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,000
OK.
So there is one subspace,
there's another one.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The floor.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And are they orthogonal?

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What does it mean for two
subspaces to be orthogonal and

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
in that special case are they
orthogonal?

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
All right.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's finish this sentence.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What does it mean means we have
to know what we're talking about

230
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,000
here.
So what would be a reasonable
idea of orthogonal?

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, let me put the right
thing up.

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It means that every vector in
S, every vector in S,

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
is orthogonal to --
what I going to say?

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Every vector in T.

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's a reasonable and it's a
good and it's the right

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
definition for two subspaces to
be orthogonal.

237
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I just want you to see,
hey, what does that mean?

238
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So answer the question about
the -- the blackboard and the

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
floor.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Are those two subspaces,
they're two-dimensional,

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
right, and we're in R^3.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's like a xz plane or
something and a xy plane.

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Are they orthogonal?

244
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Is every vector in the
blackboard orthogonal to every

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
vector in the floor,
starting from the origin right

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
there?

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes or no?

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I could take a vote.

249
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well we get some yeses and some
noes.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No is the answer.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They're not.

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You can tell me a vector in the
blackboard and a vector in the

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,570
floor that are not orthogonal.

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,000
Well you can tell me quite a
few, I guess.

255
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Maybe like I could take some
forty-five-degree guy in the

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
blackboard, and something in the
floor, they're not at ninety

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
degrees, right?

258
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,490
In fact, even more,
you could tell me a vector

259
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,000
that's in both the blackboard
plane and the floor plane,

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
so it's certainly not
orthogonal to itself.

261
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So for sure,
those two planes aren't

262
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
orthogonal.

263
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What would that be?

264
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So what's a vector that's -- in
both of those planes?

265
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's this guy running along the
crack there, in the

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
intersection,
the intersection.

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
A vector, you know --
if two subspaces meet at some

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
vector, well then for sure
they're not orthogonal,

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
because that vector is in one
and it's in the other,

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and it's not orthogonal to
itself unless it's zero.

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So the only I mean so
orthogonal is for me to say

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
these two subspaces are
orthogonal first of all I'm

273
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
certainly saying that they don't
intersect in any nonzero vector.

274
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But also I mean more than that
just not intersecting isn't good

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,000
enough.
So give me an example,
oh, let's say in the plane,

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
oh well, when do we have
orthogonal subspaces in the

277
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,370
plane?

278
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, tell me in the plane,
so we don't -- there aren't

279
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that many different subspaces in
the plane.

280
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What what have we got in the
plane as possible subspaces?

281
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The zero vector,
real small.

282
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
A line through the origin.

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Or the whole plane.

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,000
OK.
Now so when is a line through
the origin orthogonal to the

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
whole plane?

286
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Never, right,
never.

287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When is a line through the
origin orthogonal to the zero

288
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
subspace?

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Always.

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Right.
When is a line through the
origin orthogonal to a different

291
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,650
line through the origin?

292
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, that's the case that we
all have a clear picture of,

293
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
they -- the two lines have to
meet at ninety degrees.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They have only the -- so that's
like this simple case I'm

295
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
talking about.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,550
There's one subspace,
there's the other subspace.

297
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,000
They only meet at zero.

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And they're orthogonal.

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,000
OK.
Now.
So we now know what it means
for two subspaces to be

300
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
orthogonal.

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And now I want to say that this
is true for the row space and

302
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the null space.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,000
OK.
So that's the neat fact.

304
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:04,000
So row space is orthogonal to
the null space.

305
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Now how did I come up with
that?

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But you see the rank it's
great, that means that these --

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that these subspaces are just
the right things,

308
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
they're just cutting the whole
space up into two perpendicular

309
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
subspaces.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
OK.

311
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So why?
Well, what have I got to work
with?

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,300
All I know is the null space.

313
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:49,000
The null space has vectors that
solve Ax equals zero.

314
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So this is a guy x.
x is in the null space.

315
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then Ax is zero.

316
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So why is it orthogonal to the
rows of A?

317
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If I write down Ax equals zero,
which is all I know about the

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
null space, then I guess I want
you to see that that's telling

319
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
me, just that equation right
there is telling me that the

320
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
rows of A, let me write it out.

321
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There's row one of A.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Row two.

323
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Row m of A.
that's A.

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And it's multiplying X.

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And it's producing zero.

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000
OK.
Written out that way you'll see
it.

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I'm saying that a vector in
the row space is perpendicular

328
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to this guy X in the null space.

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you see why?

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because this equation is
telling you that row one of A

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
multiplying that's a dot
product, right?

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Row one of A dot product with
this x is producing this zero.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So x is orthogonal to the first
row.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And to the second row.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Row two of A,
x is giving that zero.

336
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Row m of A times x is giving
that zero.

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So x is -- the equation is
telling me that x is orthogonal

338
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
to all the rows.

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Right, it's just sitting there.

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's all we -- it had to be
sitting there because we didn't

341
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
know anything more about the
null space than this.

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And now I guess to be totally
complete here I'd now check that

343
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
x is orthogonal to each separate
row.

344
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But what else strictly speaking
do I have to do?

345
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
To show that those subspaces
are orthogonal,

346
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to take this x in the
null space and show that it's

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
orthogonal to every vector in
the row space,

348
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
every vector in the row space,
so what --

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
what else is in the row space?

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This row is in the row space,
that row is in the row space,

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
they're all there,
but it's not the whole row

352
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,150
space, right,
we just have to like remember,

353
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,000
what does it mean,
what does that word space

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
telling us?

355
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And what else is in the row
space?

356
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Besides the rows?

357
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
All their combinations.

358
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I really have to check that
sure enough if x is

359
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
perpendicular to row one,
row two, all the different

360
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
separate rows,
then also x is perpendicular to

361
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
a combination of the rows.

362
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And that's just matrix
multiplication again.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You know, I have row one
transpose x is zero,

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
so on, row two transpose x is
zero, so I'm entitled to

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
multiply that by some c1,
this by some c2,

366
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I still have zeroes,
I'm entitled to add,

367
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so I have c1 row one so --
so all this when I put that

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
together that's big parentheses
c1 row one plus c2 row two and

369
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
so on.

370
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Transpose x is zero.

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Right?

372
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I just added the zeroes and got
zero, and I just added these

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
following the rule.

374
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
No big deal.

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The whole point was right
sitting in that.

376
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
OK.

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So if I come back to this
figure now I'm like a happier

378
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
person.

379
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Because I have this -- I now
see how those subspaces are

380
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
oriented.

381
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And these subspaces are also
oriented.

382
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, actually why is that
orthogonality?

383
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, it's the same statement
for A transpose that that one

384
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,270
was for A.

385
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,000
So I won't take time to prove
it again because we've checked

386
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it for every matrix and A
transpose is just as good a

387
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
matrix as A.

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So we're orthogonal over there.

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So we really have carved up
this --

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
this was like carving up
m-dimensional space into two

391
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,260
subspaces and this one was
carving up n-dimensional space

392
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,000
into two subspaces.

393
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And well, one more thing here.

394
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
One more important thing.

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let me move into three
dimensions.

396
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Tell me a couple of orthogonal
subspaces in three dimensions

397
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that somehow don't carve up the
whole space, there's stuff left

398
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,080
there.

399
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm thinking of a couple of
orthogonal lines.

400
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If I -- suppose I'm in three
dimensions, R^3.

401
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And I have one line,
one one-dimensional subspace,

402
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and a perpendicular one.

403
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Could those be the row space
and the null space?

404
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Could those be the row space
and the null space?

405
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Could I be in three dimensions
and have a row space that's a

406
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
line and a null space that's a
line?

407
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
No.

408
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Why not?

409
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Because the dimensions aren't
right.

410
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Right?
The dimensions are no good.

411
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The dimensions here,
r and n-r, they add up to

412
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
three, they add up to n.

413
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If I take -- just follow that
example -- if the row space is

414
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
one-dimensional,
suppose A is what's a good in

415
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
R^3, I want a one-dimensional
row space, let me take one,

416
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
two, five, two,
four, ten.

417
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What's the dimension of that
row space?

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,970
One.

419
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,000
What's the dimension of the
null space?

420
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Tell what's the null space look
like in that case?

421
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The row space is a line,
right?

422
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,510
One-dimensional,
it's just a line through one,

423
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,000
two, five.

424
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Geometrically what's the row
space look like?

425
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What's its dimension?

426
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So here r here n is three,
the rank is one,

427
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
so the dimension of the null
space, so I'm looking at this x,

428
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
x1, x2, x3.

429
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
To give zero.

430
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So the dimension of the null
space is we all know is two.

431
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Right.

432
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's a plane.

433
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And now actually we know,
we see better,

434
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,070
what plane is it?

435
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,000
What plane is it?

436
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's the plane that's
perpendicular to one,

437
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
two, five.

438
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Right?

439
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We now see.

440
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,080
In fact the two,
four, ten didn't actually have

441
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,000
any effect at all.

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I could have just ignored that.

443
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That didn't change the row
space or the null space.

444
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll just make that one
equation.

445
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah.
OK.

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Sure.
That's the easiest to deal
with.

447
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
One equation.

448
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Three unknowns.

449
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I want to ask --
what would the equation give me

450
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
the null space,
and you would have said back in

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
September you would have said it
gives you a plane,

452
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and we're completely right.

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And the plane it gives you,
the normal vector,

454
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,680
you remember in calculus,
there was this dumb normal

455
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
vector called N.

456
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Well there it is.

457
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
One, two, five.

458
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
OK.
What is the what's the point I
want to make here?

459
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I want to make -- I want to
emphasize that not only are the

460
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
-- let me write it in words.

461
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I want to write the null
space and the row space are

462
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:43,000
orthogonal, that's this neat
fact, which we've --

463
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
we've just checked from Ax
equals zero, but now I want to

464
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
say more because there's a
little more that's true.

465
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Their dimensions add to the
whole space.

466
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So that's like a little extra
information.

467
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That it's not like I could have
-- I couldn't have a line and a

468
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
line in three dimensions.

469
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Those don't add up one and one
don't add to three.

470
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So I used the word orthogonal
complements in R^n.

471
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And the idea of this word
complement is that the

472
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
orthogonal complement of a row
space contains not just some

473
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
vectors that are orthogonal to
it, but all.

474
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,530
So what does that mean?

475
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:42,000
That means that the null space
contains all,

476
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,000
not just some but all,
vectors that are perpendicular

477
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to the row space.

478
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,110
OK.

479
00:32:53,110 --> 00:33:01,670
Really what I've done in this
half of the lecture is just

480
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:09,000
notice some of the nice geometry
that --

481
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that we didn't pick up before
because we didn't discuss

482
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
perpendicular vectors before.

483
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But it was all sitting there.

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And now we picked it up.

485
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That these vectors are
orthogonal complements.

486
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I guess I even call this
part one of the fundamental

487
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
theorem of linear algebra.

488
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The fundamental theorem of
linear algebra is about these

489
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,410
four subspaces,
so part one is about their

490
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,000
dimension, maybe I should call
it part two now.

491
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Their dimensions we got.

492
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Now we're getting their
orthogonality,

493
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
that's part two.

494
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And part three will be about
bases for them.

495
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Orthogonal bases.

496
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So that's coming up.

497
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
OK.

498
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So I'm happy with that geometry
right now.

499
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
OK.
OK.

500
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Now what's my next goal in this
chapter?

501
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Here's the main problem of the
chapter.

502
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The main problem of the chapter
is -- so this is coming.

503
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's coming attraction.

504
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
This is the very last chapter
that's about Ax=b.

505
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,030
I would like to solve that
system of equations when there

506
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,000
is no solution.

507
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You may say what a ridiculous
thing to do.

508
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But I have to say it's done all
the time.

509
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
In fact it has to be done.

510
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You get -- so the problem is
solve --

511
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the best possible solve I'll
put quote Ax=b when there is no

512
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,650
solution.

513
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,000
And of course what does that
mean?

514
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
b isn't in the column space.

515
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And it's quite typical if this
matrix A is rectangular if I --

516
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
maybe I have m equations and
that's bigger than the number of

517
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
unknowns, then for sure the rank
is not m,

518
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the rank couldn't be m now,
so there'll be a lot of

519
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
right-hand sides with no
solution, but here's an example.

520
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Some satellite is buzzing
along.

521
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You measure its position.

522
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,980
You make a thousand
measurements.

523
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,000
So that gives you a thousand
equations for the -- for the

524
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
parameters that --
that give the position.

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But there aren't a thousand
parameters, there's just maybe

526
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
six or something.

527
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Or you're measuring the --
you're doing questionnaires.

528
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You're measuring resistances.

529
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You're taking pulses.

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,690
You're measuring somebody's
pulse rate.

531
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:40,000
OK.

532
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There's just one unknown.

533
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The pulse rate.

534
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So you measure it once,
OK, fine, but if you really

535
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
want to know it,
you measure it multiple times,

536
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
but then the measurements have
noise in them,

537
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
so there's -- the problem is
that in many many problems we've

538
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
got too many equations and
they've got noise in the

539
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
right-hand side.

540
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So Ax=b I can't expect to solve
it exactly right,

541
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
because I don't even know what
-- there's a measurement mistake

542
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
in b.

543
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,270
But there's information too.

544
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,000
There's a lot of information
about x in there.

545
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And what I want to do is like
separate the noise,

546
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
the junk, from the information.

547
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And so this is a
straightforward linear algebra

548
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
problem.

549
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
How do I solve,
what's the best solution?

550
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,570
OK.

551
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:42,960
Now.

552
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,000
I want to say so that's like
describes the problem in an

553
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
algebraic way.

554
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I got some equations,
I'm looking for the best

555
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
solution.

556
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, one way to find it is --
one way to start,

557
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
one way to find a solution is
throw away equations until

558
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,990
you've got a nice,
square invertible system and

559
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,000
solve that.

560
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's not satisfactory.

561
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There's no reason in these
measurements to say these

562
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
measurements are perfect and
these measurements are useless.

563
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
We want to use all the
measurements to get the best

564
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
information, to get the maximum
information.

565
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But how?

566
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OK.
Let me anticipate a matrix
that's going to show up.

567
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
This A is typically
rectangular.

568
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But a matrix that shows up
whenever you have -- and we

569
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
chapter three was all about
rectangular matrices.

570
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And we know when this is
solvable, you could do

571
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
elimination on it,
right?

572
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But I'm thinking hey,
you do elimination and you get

573
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
equation zero equal other
non-zeroes.

574
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm thinking we really --
elimination is going to fail.

575
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So that's our question.

576
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Elimination will get us down to
-- will tell us if there is a

577
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
solution or not.

578
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,350
But I'm now thinking not.

579
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:23,000
OK.

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,100
So what are we going to do?

581
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,000
All right.

582
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I want to tell you to jump
ahead to the matrix that will

583
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
play a key role.

584
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So this is the matrix that you
want to understand for this

585
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,540
chapter four.

586
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,000
And it's the matrix A transpose
A.

587
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What's -- tell me some things
about that matrix.

588
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So A is this m by n matrix,
rectangular,

589
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,000
but now I'm saying that the
good matrix that shows up in the

590
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
end is A transpose A.

591
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So tell me something about
that.

592
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Is it -- what's the first thing
you know about A transpose A.

593
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's square.

594
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Right?

595
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,490
Square because this is m by n
and this is n by m.

596
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,000
So this is the result is n by
n.

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,410
Good.

598
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,000
Square.

599
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What else?

600
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's symmetric.

601
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Good.
It's symmetric.

602
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Because you remember how to do
that.

603
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,610
If we transpose that matrix
let's transpose it,

604
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,000
A transpose A,
if I transpose it,

605
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,150
then that comes first
transposed, this comes second,

606
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,000
transposed, and then
transposing twice is leaves it

607
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
--
brings it back to the same so

608
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
it's symmetric.

609
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Good.

610
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Now we now know how to ask more
about a matrix.

611
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm interested in is it
invertible?

612
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If not, what's its null space?

613
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,390
So I want to know about --
because you're going to see,

614
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,180
well, let me --
let me even,

615
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,000
well I shouldn't do this,
but I will.

616
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Let me tell you what equation
to solve when you can't solve

617
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
that one.

618
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The good equation comes from
multiplying both sides by A

619
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
transpose, so the good equation
that you get to is this one.

620
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
A transpose Ax equals A
transpose b.

621
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That will be the central
equation in the chapter.

622
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I think why not tell it to
you.

623
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Why not admit it right away.

624
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
OK.

625
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I have to -- I should really
give x.

626
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I want to sort of indicate that
this x isn't I mean this x was

627
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the solution to that equation if
it existed, but probably didn't.

628
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Now let me give this a
different name,

629
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
x hat.

630
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Because I'm hoping this one
will have a solution.

631
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,300
And I'm saying that it's my
best solution.

632
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,000
I'll have to say what does best
mean.

633
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But that's going to be my --
my plan.

634
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm going to say that the best
solution solves this equation.

635
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So you see right away why I'm
so interested in this matrix A

636
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
transpose A.

637
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And in its invertibility.

638
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,000
OK.
Now, when is it invertible?

639
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
OK.
Let me take a case,
let me just do an example and

640
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
then --
I'll just pick a matrix here.

641
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Just so we see what A transpose
A looks like.

642
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So let me take a matrix A one,
one, one, one,

643
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
two, five.

644
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Just to invent a matrix.

645
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So there's a matrix A.

646
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,440
Notice that it has M equal
three rows and N equal two

647
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,590
columns.

648
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:55,000
Its rank is -- the rank of that
matrix is two.

649
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Right, yeah,
the columns are independent.

650
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Does Ax equal b?

651
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,940
If I look at Ax=b,
so x is just x1 x2,

652
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,000
and b is b1 b2 b3.

653
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Do I expect to solve Ax=b?

654
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What's -- no way,
right?

655
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I mean linear algebra's great,
but solving three equations

656
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
with only two unknowns usually
we can't do it.

657
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We can only solve it if this
vector is b is what?

658
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I can solve that equation if
that vector b1 b2 b3 is in the

659
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
column space.

660
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
If it's a combination of those
columns then fine.

661
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But usually it won't be.

662
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,960
The combinations just fill up a
plane and most vectors aren't on

663
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,000
that plane.

664
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So what I'm saying is that I'm
going to work with the matrix A

665
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
transpose A.

666
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I just want to figure out
in this example what A transpose

667
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,930
A is.

668
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,000
So it's two by two.

669
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
The first entry is a three,
the next entry is an eight,

670
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,960
this entry is -- what's that
entry?

671
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,000
Eight, for sure.

672
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
We knew it had to be,
and this entry is,

673
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
what's that now,
getting out my trusty

674
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,080
calculator, thirty,
is that right?

675
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,000
Thirty.

676
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And is that matrix invertible?

677
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
There's an A transpose A.

678
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And it is invertible,
right?

679
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Three, eight is not a multiple
of eight, thirty -- and it's

680
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
invertible.

681
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And that's the normal,
that's what I expect.

682
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So this is I want to show.

683
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So here's the final -- here's
the key point.

684
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,640
The null space of A transpose A
-- it's not going to be always

685
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,000
invertible.

686
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Tell me a matrix -- I have to
say that I can't say A transpose

687
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
A is always invertible.

688
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,310
Because that's asking too much.

689
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,000
I mean what could the matrix A
be, for example,

690
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
so that A transpose A was not
invertible?

691
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Well, it even could be the zero
matrix.

692
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I mean that's like extreme
case.

693
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Suppose I make this rank --
suppose I change to that A.

694
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Now I figure out A transpose A
again and I get -- what do I

695
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
get?

696
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I get nine, I get nine of
course and here I get what's

697
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
that entry?

698
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Twenty-seven.

699
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,760
And is that matrix invertible?

700
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,000
No.

701
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And why do I -- I knew it
wouldn't be invertible anyway.

702
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because this matrix only has
rank one.

703
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And if I have a product of
matrices of rank one,

704
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
the product is not going to
have a rank bigger than one.

705
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So I'm not surprised that the
answer only has rank one.

706
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And that's what I -- always
happens, that the rank of A

707
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
transpose A comes out to equal
the rank of A.

708
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So, yes, so the null space of A
transpose A equals the null

709
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
space of A, the rank of A
transpose A equals the rank of

710
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
A.

711
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:10,130
So let's -- as soon as I can
why that's true.

712
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:18,000
But let's draw from that what
the fact that I want.

713
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,950
This tells me that this square
symmetric matrix is invertible

714
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:34,000
if -- so here's my conclusion.

715
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
A transpose A is invertible if
exactly when --

716
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,000
exactly if this null space is
only got the zero vector.

717
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Which means the columns of A
are independent.

718
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So A transpose A is invertible
exactly if A has independent

719
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
columns.

720
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's the fact that I need
about A transpose A.

721
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And then you'll see next time
how A transpose A enters

722
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
everything.

723
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Next lecture is actually a
crucial one.

724
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Here I'm preparing for it by
getting us thinking about A

725
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
transpose A.

726
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And its rank is the same as the
rank of A, and we can decide

727
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
when it's invertible.

728
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
OK.

729
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So I'll see you Friday.

730
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Thanks.
