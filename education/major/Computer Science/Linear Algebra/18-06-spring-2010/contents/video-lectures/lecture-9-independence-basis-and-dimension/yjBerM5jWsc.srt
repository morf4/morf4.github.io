1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OK, this is linear algebra
lecture nine.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And this is a key lecture,
this is where we get these

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
ideas of linear independence,
when a bunch of vectors are

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
independent -- or dependent,
that's the opposite.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The space they span.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,650
A basis for a subspace or a
basis for a vector space,

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,850
that's a central idea.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,000
And then the dimension of that
subspace.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this is the day that those
words get assigned clear

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
meanings.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,910
And emphasize that we talk
about a bunch of vectors being

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,000
independent.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wouldn't talk about a matrix
being independent.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A bunch of vectors being
independent.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A bunch of vectors spanning a
space.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A bunch of vectors being a
basis.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the dimension is some
number.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
OK, so what are the
definitions?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Can I begin with a fact,
a highly important fact,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that, I didn't call directly
attention to earlier.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Suppose I have a matrix and I
look at Ax equals zero.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Suppose the matrix has a lot of
columns, so that n is bigger

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
than m.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So I'm looking at n equations
-- I mean, sorry,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
m equations,
a small number of equations m,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and more unknowns.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have more unknowns than
equations.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let me write that down.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
More unknowns than equations.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
More unknown x-s than
equations.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then the conclusion is that
there's something in the null

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
space of A, other than just the
zero vector.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The conclusion is there are
some non-zero x-s such that Ax

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
is zero.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,260
There are some special
solutions.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,250
And why?

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,470
We know why.

38
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,000
I mean, it sort of like seems
like a reasonable thing,

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
more unknowns than equations,
then it seems reasonable that

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we can solve them.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But we have a,
a clear algorithm which starts

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
with a system and does
elimination, gets the thing into

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,620
an echelon form with some pivots
and pivot columns,

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,000
and possibly some free columns
that don't have pivots.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And the point is here there
will be some free columns.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The reason, so the reason is
there must -- there will be free

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
variables, at least one.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's the reason.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That we now have this --
a complete, algorithm,

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
a complete systematic way to
say, OK, we take the system Ax

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
equals zero, we row reduce,
we identify the free variables,

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and, since there are n
variables and at most m pivots,

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
there will be some free
variables, at least one,

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
at least n-m in fact,
left over.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And those variables I can
assign non-zero values to.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't have to set those to
zero.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can take them to be one or
whatever I like,

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and then I can solve for the
pivot variables.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So then it gives me a solution
to Ax equals zero.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And it's a solution that isn't
all zeros.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, that's an important point
that we'll use now in this

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
lecture.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So now I want to say what does
it mean for a bunch of vectors

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
to be independent.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OK.
So this is like the background
that we know.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now I want to speak about
independence.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OK.
Let's see.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can give you the abstract
definition, and I will,

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but I would also like to give
you the direct meaning.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,860
So the question is,
when vectors x1,

71
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,000
x2 up to --
Suppose I have n vectors are

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
independent if.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,500
Now I have to give you -- or
linearly independent -- I'll

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
often just say and write
independent for short.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OK.
I'll give you the full
definition.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
These are just vectors in some
vector space.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can take combinations of
them.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The question is,
do any combinations give zero?

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If some combination of those
vectors gives the zero vector,

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
other than the combination of
all zeros, then they're

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
dependent.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They're independent if no
combination gives the zero

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
vector -- and then I have,
I'll have to put in an except

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the zero combination.

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So what do I mean by that?

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No combination gives the zero
vector.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Any combination c1 x1+c2 x2
plus, plus cn xn is not zero

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
except for the zero combination.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is when all the c-s,
all the c-s are zero.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then of course.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That combination -- I know I'll
get zero.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But the question is,
does any other combination give

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
zero?

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,570
If not, then the vectors are
independent.

95
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,000
If some other combination does
give zero, the vectors are

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
dependent.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,330
OK.

98
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's just take examples.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Suppose I'm in,
say, in two dimensional space.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
OK.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I give you -- I'd like to first
take an example -- let me take

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
an example where I have a vector
and twice that vector.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So that's two vectors,
V and 2V.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are those dependent or
independent?

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Those are dependent for sure,
right, because there's one

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
vector is twice the other.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,150
One vector is twice as long as
the other, so if the word

108
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,000
dependent means anything,
these should be dependent.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And they are.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And in fact,
I would take two of the first

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
-- so here's,
here is a vector V and the

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
other guy is a vector 2V,
that's my -- so there's a

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
vector V1 and my next vector V2
is 2V1.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,420
Of course those are dependent,
because two of these first

115
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,000
vectors minus the second vector
is zero.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's a combination of these
two vectors that gives the zero

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
vector.
OK, that was clear.

118
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Suppose, suppose I have a
vector -- here's another

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
example.
It's easy example.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Suppose I have a vector and the
other guy is the zero vector.

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Suppose I have a vector V1 and
V2 is the zero vector.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then are those vectors
dependent or independent?

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They're dependent again.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You could say,
well, this guy is zero times

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that one.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This one is some combination of
those.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But let me write it the other
way.

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let me say --
what combination,

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
how many V1s and how many V2s
shall I take to get the zero

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
vector?
If, if V1 is like the vector
two one and V2 is the zero

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
vector, zero zero,
then I would like to show that

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
some combination of those gives
the zero vector.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What shall I take?

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How many V1s shall I take?

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Zero of them.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, no, take no V1s.

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But how many V2s?

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Six.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OK.
Or five.

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then -- in other words,
the point is if the zero

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
vector's in there,
if the zero --

142
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
if one of these vectors is the
zero vector, independence is

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
dead, right?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If one of those vectors is the
zero vector then I could always

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
take -- include that one and
none of the others,

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and I would get the zero
answer, and I would show

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
dependence.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,320
OK.

149
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Now, let me,
let me finally draw an example

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
where they will be independent.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Suppose that's V1 and that's
V2.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Those are surely independent,
right?

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Any combination of V1 and V2,
will not be zero except,

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,850
the zero combination.

155
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,000
So those would be independent.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But now let me,
let me stick in a third vector,

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
V3.
Independent or dependent now,
those three vectors?

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So now n is three here.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm in two dimensional space,
whatever, I'm in the plane.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I have three vectors that I
didn't draw so carefully.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I didn't even tell you what
exactly they were.

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But what's this answer on
dependent or independent?

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Dependent.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How do I know those are
dependent?

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How do I know that some
combination of V1,

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
V2, and V3 gives me the zero
vector?

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I know because of that.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's the key fact that tells
me that three vectors in the

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
plane have to be dependent.

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why's that?

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's the connection between
the dependence of these three

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
vectors and that fact?

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OK.
So here's the connection.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I take the matrix A that has V1
in its first column,

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
V2 in its second column,
V3 in its third column.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So it's got three columns.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And V1 -- I don't know,
that looks like about two one

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
to me.
V2 looks like it might be one
two.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
V3 looks like it might be maybe
two, maybe two and a half,

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
minus one.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OK.
Those are my three vectors,
and I put them in the columns

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
of A.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now that matrix A is two by
three.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,260
It fits this pattern,
that where we know we've got

185
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,000
extra variables,
we know we have some free

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
variables, we know that there's
some combination --

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and let me instead of x-s,
let me call them c1,

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
c2, and c3 -- that gives the
zero vector.

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry that my little bit of art
got in the way.

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Do you see the point?

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
When I have a matrix,
I'm interested in whether its

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
columns are dependent or
independent.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The columns are dependent if
there is something in the null

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,230
space.

195
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,310
The columns are dependent
because this,

196
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,000
this thing in the null space
says that c1 of that plus c2 of

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,760
that plus c3 of this is zero.

198
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,000
So in other words,
I can go out some V1,

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,780
out some more V2,
back on V3, and end up zero.

200
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,000
OK.

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So let -- here I've give the
general, abstract definition,

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but let me repeat that
definition -- this is like

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
repeat -- let me call them Vs
now.

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
V1 up to Vn are the columns of
a matrix A.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In other words,
this is telling me that if I'm

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in m dimensional space,
like two dimensional space in

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the example, I can answer the
dependence-independence question

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,700
directly by putting those
vectors in the columns of a

209
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
matrix.

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They are independent if the
null space of A,

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of A, is what?

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If I have a bunch of columns in
a matrix, I'm looking at their

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
combinations,
but that's just A times the

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
vector of c-s.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And these columns will be
independent if the null space of

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
A is the zero vector.

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They are dependent if there's
something else in there.

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If there's something else in
the null space,

219
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:23,000
if A times c gives the zero
vector for some non-zero vector

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
c in the null space.

221
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then they're dependent,
because that's telling me a

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
combination of the columns gives
the zero column.

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,960
I think you're with be,
because we've seen,

224
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,000
like, lecture after lecture,
we're looking at the

225
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
combinations of the columns and
asking, do we get zero or don't

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,620
we?

227
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,000
And now we're giving the
official name,

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
dependent if we do,
independent if we don't.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So I could express this in
other words now.

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I could say the rank -- what's
the rank in this independent

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
case?

232
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The rank r of the,
of the matrix,

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in the case of independent
columns, is?

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So the columns are independent.

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So how many pivot columns have
I got.

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,000
All n.
All the columns would be pivot
columns, because free columns

237
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
are telling me that they're a
combination of earlier columns.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,240
So this would be the case where
the rank is n.

239
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,000
This would be the case where
the rank is smaller than n.

240
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So in this case the rank is n
and the null space of A is only

241
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
the zero vector.

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And no free variables.

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No free variables.

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And this is the case yes free
variables.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If you'll allow me to stretch
the English language that far.

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's the case where we have,
a combination that gives the

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
zero column.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm often interested in the
case when my vectors are popped

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
into a matrix.

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So the, the definition over
there of independence didn't

251
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
talk about any matrix.

252
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The vectors didn't have to be
vectors in N dimensional space.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I want to give you some
examples of vectors that aren't

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
what you think of immediately as
vectors.

255
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But most of the time,
this is -- the vectors we think

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
of are columns.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And we can put them in a
matrix.

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then independence or
dependence comes back to the

259
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
null space.

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
OK.
So that's the idea of
independence.

261
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,150
Can I just, yeah,
let me go on to spanning a

262
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,000
space.

263
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What does it mean for a bunch
of vectors to span a space?

264
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, actually,
we've seen it already.

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You remember,
if we had a columns in a

266
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
matrix, we took all their
combinations and that gave us

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the column space.

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Those vectors that we started
with span that column space.

269
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So spanning a space means -- so
let me move that important stuff

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
right up.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
OK.

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So vectors -- let me call them,
say, V1 up to -- call you some

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
different letter,
say Vl -- span a space,

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
a subspace, or just a vector
space I could say,

275
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
span a space means,
means the space consists of all

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
combinations of those vectors.

277
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's exactly what we did with
the column space.

278
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So now I could say in shorthand
the columns of a matrix span the

279
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
column space.

280
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So you remember it's a bunch of
vectors that have this property

281
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that they span a space,
and actually if I give you a

282
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,720
bunch of vectors and say --
OK, let S be the space that

283
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,000
they span, in other words let S
contain all their combinations,

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that space S will be the
smallest space with those

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
vectors in it,
right?

286
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Because any space with those
vectors in it must have all the

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
combinations of those vectors in
it.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And if I stop there,
then I've got the smallest

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
space, and that's the space that
they span.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OK.
So I'm just -- rather than,
needing to say,

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,250
take all linear combinations
and put them in a space,

292
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm compressing that into the
word span.

293
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Straightforward.

294
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,000
OK.

295
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,780
So if I think of a,
of the column space of a

296
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,000
matrix.

297
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I've got their -- so I start
with the columns.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I take all their combinations.

299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That gives me the columns
space.

300
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They span the column space.

301
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Now are they independent?

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Maybe yes, maybe no.

303
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It depends on the particular
columns that went into that

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,000
matrix.
But obviously I'm highly
interested in a set of vectors

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that spans a space and is
independent.

306
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,290
That's, that means like I've
got the right number of vectors.

307
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,000
If I didn't have all of them,
I wouldn't have my whole space.

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If I had more than that,
they probably wouldn't --

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
they wouldn't be independent.

310
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, like, basis -- and that's
the word that's coming -- is

311
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
just right.

312
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So here let me put what that
word means.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A basis for a vector space is,
is a, is a sequence of vectors

314
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
--
shall I call them V1,

315
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
V2, up to let me say Vd now,
I'll stop with that letters --

316
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that has two properties.

317
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've got enough vectors and not
too many.

318
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a natural idea of a basis.

319
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So a basis is a bunch of
vectors in the space and it's a

320
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
so it's a sequence of vectors
with two properties,

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
with two properties.

322
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
One, they are independent.

323
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And two -- you know what's
coming?

324
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
-- they span the space.

325
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,000
OK.
Let me take -- so time for
examples, of course.

326
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So I'm asking you now to put
definition one,

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the definition of independence,
together with definition two,

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and let's look at examples,
because this is -- this

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
combination means the set I've
-- of vectors I have is just

330
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
right, and the -- so that this
idea of a basis will be central.

331
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll always be asking you now
for a basis.

332
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Whenever I look at a subspace,
if I ask you for -- if you give

333
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
me a basis for that subspace,
you've told me what it is.

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You've told me everything I
need to know about that

335
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
subspace.

336
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Those -- I take their
combinations and I know that I

337
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
need all the combinations.

338
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
OK.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Examples.

340
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
OK, so examples of a basis.

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,020
Let me start with two
dimensional space.

342
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,000
Suppose the space -- say
example.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,440
The space is,
oh, let's make it R^3.

344
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Real three dimensional space.

345
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Give me one basis.

346
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
One basis is?

347
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So I want some vectors,
because if I ask you for a

348
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
basis, I'm asking you for
vectors, a little list of

349
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
vectors.

350
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it should be just right.

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So what would be a basis for
three dimensional space?

352
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, the first basis that
comes to mind,

353
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
why don't we write that down.

354
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The first basis that comes to
mind is this vector,

355
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
this vector,
and this vector.

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,000
OK.
That's one basis.

357
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Not the only basis,
that's going to be my point.

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But let's just see -- yes,
that's a basis.

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Are, are those vectors
independent?

360
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So that's the like the x,
y, z axes, so if those are not

361
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
independent, we're in trouble.

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Certainly, they are.

363
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Take a combination c1 of this
vector plus c2 of this vector

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
plus c3 of that vector and try
to make it give the zero vector.

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What are the c-s?

366
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
If c1 of that plus c2 of that
plus c3 of that gives me 0 0 0,

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
then the c-s are all -- 0,
right.

368
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So that's the test for
independence.

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
In the language of matrices,
which was under that board,

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I could make those the columns
of a matrix.

371
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, it would be the identity
matrix.

372
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Then I would ask,
what's the null space of the

373
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
identity matrix?

374
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And you would say it's only the
zero vector.

375
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I would say,
fine, then the columns are

376
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,190
independent.

377
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,000
The only thing -- the identity
times a vector giving zero,

378
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the only vector that does that
is zero.

379
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,000
OK.
Now that's not the only basis.

380
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Far from it.

381
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Tell me another basis,
a second basis,

382
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
another basis.

383
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So, give me -- well,
I'll just start it out.

384
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
One one two.

385
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Two two five.

386
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,690
Suppose I stopped there.

387
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,000
Has that little bunch of
vectors got the properties that

388
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm asking for in a basis for
R^3?

389
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We're looking for a basis for
R^3.

390
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Are they independent,
those two column vectors?

391
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes.

392
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Do they span R^3?

393
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,350
No.

394
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,000
Our feeling is no.

395
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Our feeling is no.

396
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Our feeling is that there're
some vectors in R3 that are not

397
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
combinations of those.

398
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,290
OK.

399
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,000
So suppose I add in -- I need
another vector then,

400
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because these two don't span
the space.

401
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,000
OK.
Now it would be foolish for me
to put in three three seven,

402
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
right, as the third vector.

403
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That would be a goof.

404
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Because that,
if I put in three three seven,

405
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,650
those vectors would be
dependent, right?

406
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,000
If I put in three three seven,
it would be the sum of those

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
two, it would lie in the same
plane as those.

408
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It wouldn't be independent.

409
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,310
My attempt to create a basis
would be dead.

410
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,000
But if I take -- so what vector
can I take?

411
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I can take any vector that's
not in that plane.

412
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let me try -- I hope that 3 3 8
would do it.

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
At least it's not the sum of
those two vectors.

414
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But I believe that's a basis.

415
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And what's the test then,
for that to be a basis?

416
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,570
Because I just picked those
numbers, and if I had picked,

417
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:57,000
5 7 -14 how would we know do we
have a basis or don't we?

418
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You would put them in the
columns of a matrix,

419
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and you would do elimination,
row reduction --

420
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and you would see do you get
any free variables or are all

421
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the columns pivot columns.

422
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Well now actually we have a
square -- the matrix would be

423
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
three by three.

424
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So, what's the test on the
matrix then?

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The matrix -- so in this case,
when my space is R^3 and I have

426
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
three vectors,
my matrix is square and what I

427
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
asking about that matrix in
order for those columns to be a

428
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,340
basis?

429
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:05,000
So in this -- for R^n,
if I have -- n vectors give a

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
basis if the n by n matrix with
those columns,

431
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
with those columns,
is what?

432
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
What's the requirement on that
matrix?

433
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Invertible, right,
right.

434
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The matrix should be
invertible.

435
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
For a square matrix,
that's the, that's the perfect

436
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
answer.

437
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Is invertible.

438
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So that's when,
that's when the space is the

439
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
whole space R^n.

440
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Let me, let me be sure you're
with me here.

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let me remove that.

442
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Are those two vectors a basis
for any space at all?

443
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Is there a vector space that
those really are a basis for,

444
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
those, that pair of vectors,
this guy and this 1,

445
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
1 1 2 and 2 2 5?

446
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Is there a space for which
that's a basis?

447
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Sure.
They're independent,
so they satisfy the first

448
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
requirement, so what space shall
I take for them to be a basis

449
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,000
of?
What spaces will they be a
basis for?

450
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The one they span.

451
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Their combinations.

452
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's a plane,
right?

453
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It'll be a plane inside R^3.

454
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So if I take this vector 1 1 2,
say it goes there,

455
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and this vector 2 2 5,
say it goes there,

456
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
those are a basis for --
because they span a plane.

457
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And they're a basis for the
plane, because they're

458
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,000
independent.
If I stick in some third guy,
like 3 3 7, which is in the

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
plane -- suppose I put in,
try to put in 3 3 7,

460
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,450
then the three vectors would
still span the plane,

461
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,000
but they wouldn't be a basis
anymore because they're not

462
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
independent anymore.

463
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,000
OK.

464
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So, we're looking at the
question of -- again,

465
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,810
the case with independent
columns is the case where the

466
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:32,000
column vectors span the column
space.

467
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,930
They're independent,
so they're a basis for the

468
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,000
column space.

469
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,000
OK.
So now there's one bit of
intuition.

470
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Let me go back to all of R^n.

471
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I -- where I put 3 3 8.

472
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,180
OK.

473
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,000
The first message is that the
basis is not unique,

474
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,480
right.

475
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,000
There's zillions of bases.

476
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I take any invertible three by
three matrix,

477
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
its columns are a basis for
R^3.

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The column space is R^3,
and if those,

479
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
if that matrix is invertible,
those columns are independent,

480
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I've got a basis for R^3.

481
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So there're many,
many bases.

482
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But there is something in
common for all those bases.

483
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There's something that this
basis shares with that basis and

484
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,870
every other basis for R^3.

485
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,000
And what's that?

486
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, you saw it coming,
because when I stopped here and

487
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
asked if that was a basis for
R^3, you said no.

488
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I know that you said no
because you knew there weren't

489
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
enough vectors there.

490
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And the great fact is that
there're many,

491
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
many bases, but -- let me put
in somebody else,

492
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
just for variety.

493
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
There are many,
many bases, but they all have

494
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
the same number of vectors.

495
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
If we're talking about the
space R^3, then that number of

496
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
vectors is three.

497
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
If we're talking about the
space R^n, then that number of

498
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
vectors is n.

499
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If we're talking about some
other space, the column space of

500
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
some matrix, or the null space
of some matrix,

501
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
or some other space that we
haven't even thought of,

502
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
then that still is true that
every basis -- that there're

503
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,510
lots of bases but every basis
has the same number of vectors.

504
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,770
Let me write that great fact
down.

505
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,000
Every basis -- we're given a
space.

506
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Given a space.

507
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
R^3 or R^n or some other column
space of a matrix or the null

508
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,070
space of a matrix or some other
vector space.

509
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:26,000
Then the great fact is that
every basis for this,

510
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
for the space has the same
number of vectors.

511
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If one basis has six vectors,
then every other basis has six

512
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
vectors.

513
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So that number six is telling
me like it's telling me how big

514
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
is the space.

515
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's telling me how many
vectors do I have to have to

516
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
have a basis.

517
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And of course we're seeing it
this way.

518
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That number six,
if we had seven vectors,

519
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
then we've got too many.

520
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If we have five vectors we
haven't got enough.

521
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Sixes are like just right for
whatever space that is.

522
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,470
And what do we call that
number?

523
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:27,000
That number is -- now I'm ready
for the last definition today.

524
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's the dimension of that
space.

525
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So every basis for a space has
the same number of vectors in

526
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,000
it.
Not the same vectors,
all sorts of bases --

527
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,680
but the same number of vectors
is always the same,

528
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,000
and that number is the
dimension.

529
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is definitional.

530
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This number is the dimension of
the space.

531
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,000
OK.
OK.

532
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Let's do some examples.

533
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,710
Because now we've got
definitions.

534
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:12,000
Let me repeat the four things,
the four words that have now

535
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
got defined.

536
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Independence,
that looks at combinations not

537
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,000
being zero.
Spanning, that looks at all the
combinations.

538
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Basis, that's the one that
combines independence and

539
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
spanning.

540
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And now we've got the idea of
the dimension of a space.

541
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's the number of vectors in
any basis, because all bases

542
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,790
have the same number.

543
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,000
OK.

544
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,470
Let's take examples.

545
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,000
Suppose I take,
my space is -- examples now --

546
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
space is the,
say, the column space of this

547
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
matrix.

548
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Let me write down a matrix.
1 1 1, 2 1 2,

549
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and I'll -- just to make it
clear, I'll take the sum there,

550
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
3 2 3, and let me take the sum
of all -- oh,

551
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
let me put in one -- yeah,
I'll put in one one one again.

552
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OK.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So that's four vectors.

554
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,740
OK, do they span the column
space of that matrix?

555
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,000
Let me repeat,
do they span the column space

556
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,150
of that matrix?

557
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes.

558
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,720
By definition,
that's what the column space --

559
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,000
where it comes from.

560
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Are they a basis for the column
space?

561
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Are they independent?

562
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
No, they're not independent.

563
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's something in that null
space.

564
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Maybe we can -- so let's look
at the null space of the matrix.

565
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Tell me a vector that's in the
null space of that matrix.

566
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So I'm looking for some vector
that combines those columns and

567
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
produces the zero column.

568
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Or in other words,
I'm looking for solutions to A

569
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
X equals zero.

570
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So tell me a vector in the null
space.

571
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Maybe -- well,
this was, this column was that

572
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
one plus that one,
so maybe if I have one of those

573
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and minus one of those that
would be a vector in the null

574
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,000
space.
So, you've already told me now,
are those vectors independent,

575
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the answer is -- those column
vectors, the answer is -- no.

576
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Right?

577
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They're not independent.

578
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,330
Because -- you knew they
weren't independent.

579
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,000
Anyway, minus one of this minus
one of this plus one of this

580
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,030
zero of that is the zero vector.

581
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,000
OK.

582
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
OK, so they're not independent.

583
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
They span, but they're not
independent.

584
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Tell me a basis for that column
space.

585
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,730
What's a basis for the column
space?

586
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,000
These are all the questions
that the homework asks,

587
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
the quizzes ask,
the final exam will ask.

588
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Find a basis for the column
space of this matrix.

589
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,000
OK.
Now there's many answers,
but give me the most natural

590
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,670
answer.

591
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,000
Columns one and two.

592
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Columns one and two.

593
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That's the natural answer.

594
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Those are the pivot columns,
because, I mean,

595
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
we s- we begin systematically.

596
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We look at the first column,
it's OK.

597
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We can put that in the basis.

598
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We look at the second column,
it's OK.

599
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We can put that in the basis.

600
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The third column we can't put
in the basis.

601
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The fourth column we can't,
again.

602
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So the rank of the matrix is --
what's the rank of our matrix?

603
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Two.

604
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,030
Two.

605
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:08,000
And, and now that rank is also
-- we also have another word.

606
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We, we have a great theorem
here.

607
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The rank of A,
that rank r,

608
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
is the number of pivot columns
and it's also -- well,

609
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
so now please use my new word.

610
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
This, it's the number two,
of course, two is the rank of

611
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,130
my matrix,
it's the number of pivot

612
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:46,900
columns, those pivot columns
form a basis,

613
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,000
of course, so what's two?

614
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's the dimension.

615
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The rank of A,
the number of pivot columns,

616
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,070
is the dimension of the column
space.

617
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,000
Of course, you say.

618
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It had to be.

619
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Right.

620
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But just watch,
look for one moment at the,

621
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the language,
the way the English words get

622
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
involved here.

623
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I take the rank of a matrix,
the rank of a matrix.

624
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's a number of columns and
it's the dimension of -- not the

625
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
dimension of the matrix,
that's what I want to say.

626
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's the dimension of a space,
a subspace, the column space.

627
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Do you see, I don't take the
dimension of A.

628
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That's not what I want.

629
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm looking for the dimension
of the column space of A.

630
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,000
If you use those words right,
it shows you've got the idea

631
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,000
right.
Similarly here.

632
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't talk about the rank of
a subspace.

633
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's a matrix that has a rank.

634
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I talk about the rank of a
matrix.

635
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And the beauty is that these
definitions just merge so that

636
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,760
the rank of a matrix is the
dimension of its column space.

637
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,000
And in this example it's two.

638
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And then the further question
is, what's a basis?

639
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And the first two columns are a
basis.

640
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,140
Tell me another basis.

641
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,000
Another basis for the columns
space.

642
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You see I just keep hammering
away.

643
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I apologize,
but it's, I have to be sure you

644
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
have the idea of basis.

645
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Tell me another basis for the
column space.

646
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, you could take columns
one and three.

647
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That would be a basis for the
column space.

648
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Or columns two and three would
be a basis.

649
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Or columns two and four.

650
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Or tell me another basis that's
not made out of those columns at

651
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
all?

652
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So -- I guess I'm giving you
infinitely many possibilities,

653
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
so I can't expect a unanimous
answer here.

654
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll tell you -- but let's look
at another basis,

655
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
though.

656
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'll just -- because it's only
one out of zillions,

657
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm going to put it down and
I'm going to erase it.

658
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Another basis for the column
space would be -- let's see.

659
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'll put in some things that
are not there.

660
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Say, oh well,
just to make it -- my life

661
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
easy, 2 2 2.

662
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's in the column space.

663
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And, that was sort of obvious.

664
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Let me take the sum of those,
say 6 4 6.

665
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,450
Or the sum of all of the
columns, 7 5 7,

666
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,000
why not.

667
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That's in the column space.

668
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Those are independent and I've
got the number right,

669
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I've got two.

670
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Actually, this is a key point.

671
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,040
If you know the dimension of
the space you're working with,

672
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:13,000
and we know that this column --
we know that the dimension,

673
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
DIM, the dimension of the
column space is two.

674
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,550
If you know the dimension,
then -- and we have a couple of

675
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:32,000
vectors that are independent,
they'll automatically be a

676
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000
basis.
If we've got the number of
vectors right,

677
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
two vectors in this case,
then if they're independent,

678
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
they can't help but span the
space.

679
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,380
Because if they didn't span the
space, there'd be a third guy to

680
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,000
help span the space,
but it couldn't be independent.

681
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,250
So, it just has to be
independent if we've got the

682
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,000
numbers right.

683
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And they span.

684
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,000
OK.
Very good.

685
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So you got the dimension of a
space.

686
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So this was another basis that
I just invented.

687
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000
OK.
Now, now I get to ask about the
null space.

688
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,820
What's the dimension of the
null space?

689
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,000
So we, we got a great fact
there, the dimension of the

690
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
column space is the rank.

691
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,340
Now I want to ask you about the
null space.

692
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:35,000
That's the other part of the
lecture, and it'll go on to the

693
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
next lecture.

694
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,540
OK.

695
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,000
So we know the dimension of the
column space is two,

696
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
the rank.

697
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
What about the null space?

698
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
This is a vector in the null
space.

699
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Are there other vectors in the
null space?

700
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yes or no?
Yes.

701
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So this isn't a basis because
it's doesn't span,

702
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
right?

703
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
There's more in the null space
than we've got so far.

704
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I need another vector at least.

705
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So tell me another vector in
the null space.

706
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Well, the natural choice,
the choice you naturally think

707
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
of is I'm going on to the fourth
column, I'm letting that free

708
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
variable be a one,
and that free variable be a

709
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
zero, and I'm asking is that
fourth column a combination of

710
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
my pivot columns?

711
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes, it is.

712
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And it's -- that will do.

713
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So what I've written there are
actually the two special

714
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
solutions, right?

715
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I took the two free variables,
free and free.

716
00:47:42,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I gave them the values 1 0 or 0

717
00:00:01,000 --> 00:47:46,000


718
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I figured out the rest.

719
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So do you see,
let me just say it in words.

720
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This vector,
these vectors in the null space

721
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
are telling me,
they're telling me the

722
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
combinations of the columns that
give zero.

723
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They're telling me in what way
the, the columns are dependent.

724
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's what the null space is
doing.

725
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Have I got enough now?

726
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And what's the null space now?

727
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,350
We have to think about the null
space.

728
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,000
These are two vectors in the
null space.

729
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,460
They're independent.

730
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,000
Are they a basis for the null
space?

731
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,350
What's the dimension of the
null space?

732
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:30,000
You see that those questions
just keep coming up all the

733
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,000
time.
Are they a basis for the null
space?

734
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You can tell me the answer even
though we haven't written out a

735
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
proof of that.

736
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Can you?

737
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yes or no?

738
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Do these two special solutions
form a basis for the null space?

739
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
In other words,
does the null space consist of

740
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
all combinations of those two
guys?

741
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes or no?

742
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,870
Yes.

743
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes.

744
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,570
The null space is two
dimensional.

745
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,000
The null space,
the dimension of the null

746
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
space, is the number of free
variables.

747
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So the dimension of the null
space is the number of free

748
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
variables.

749
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And at the last second,
give me the formula.

750
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This is then the key formula
that we know.

751
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
How many free variables are
there in terms of R,

752
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the rank, m --
the number of rows,

753
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
n, the number of columns?

754
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,090
What do we get?

755
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,000
We have n columns,
r of them are pivot columns,

756
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
so n-r is the number of free
columns, free variables.

757
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And now it's the dimension of
the null space.

758
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
OK.

759
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,600
That's great.

760
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,000
That's the key spaces,
their bases,

761
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and their dimensions.

762
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Thanks.
