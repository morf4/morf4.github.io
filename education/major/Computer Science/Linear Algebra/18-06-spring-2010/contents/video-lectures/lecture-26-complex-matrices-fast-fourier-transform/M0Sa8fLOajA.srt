1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay.
This is a lecture where complex
numbers come in.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's a -- complex numbers have
slipped into this course because

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
even a real matrix can have
complex eigenvalues.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we met complex numbers there
as the eigenvalues and complex

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
eigenvectors.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we -- or --
this is probably the last -- we

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
have a lot of other things to do
about eigenvalues and

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
eigenvectors.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And that will be mostly real.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,650
But at one point somewhere,
we have to see what you do when

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,000
the numbers become complex
numbers.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What happens when the vectors
are complex, when the matrixes

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
are complex,
when the -- what's the inner

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
product of two,
the dot product of two complex

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
vectors -- we just have to make
the change, just see -- what is

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the change when numbers become
complex?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then, can I tell you about the
most important example of

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
complex matrixes?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It comes in the Fourier matrix.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So the Fourier matrix,
which I'll describe,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
is a complex matrix.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's certainly the most
important complex matrix.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's the matrix that we need in
Fourier transform.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And the -- really,
the special thing that I want

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to
tell you about is what's called

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the fast Fourier transform,
and everybody refers to it as

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,820
the FFT and it's in all computer
and it's used -- it's being used

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,000
as we speak in a thousand
places, because it has,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
like, transformed whole
industries

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,830
to be able to do the Fourier
transform fast,

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,000
which means multiplying -- how
do I multiply fast by that

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
matrix -- by that n by n matrix?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Normally, multiplications by an
n by n matrix -- would normally

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
be n squared multiplications,
because I've got n squared

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
entries
and none of them is zero.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is a full matrix.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And it's a matrix with
orthogonal columns.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, it's just,
like, the best matrix.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this fast Fourier transform
idea reduces this n squared,

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
which was slowing up the
calculation of Fourier

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
transforms
down to n log(n).

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
n log(n), log to the base two,
actually.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And it's this -- when that hit
-- when that possibility hit,

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it made a big difference.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Everybody realized gradually
what, -- that this simple idea

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,960
-- you'll see it's just a simple
matrix factorization -- but it

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
changed everything.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I want to talk about complex
vectors and matrixes in general,

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
recap a little bit from last
time, and the Fourier matrix in

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
particular.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So what's the deal?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The main point is,
what about length?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm given a vector,
I have a vector x.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Or let me call it z as a
reminder that it's complex,

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
for the moment.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But I can -- later I'll call
the components x.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They'll be complex numbers.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,040
But it's a vector -- z1,
z2 down to zn.

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,000
So the only novelty is it's not
in R^n

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
anymore.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's in complex n dimensional
space.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Each of those numbers is a
complex number.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,000
So this z,z1 is in C^n,
n dimensional complex space

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
instead of R^n.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So just a different letter
there, but now the point about

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,560
its length
is what?

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,290
The point about its length is
that z transpose z is no good.

71
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:36,000
z transpose z -- if I just put
down z transpose here,

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it would be z1,
z2, to zn.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Doing that multiplication
doesn't give me the right thing.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
W-Why not?

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,920
Because the length squared
should

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,000
be positive.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And if I multiply -- suppose
this is, like,

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
1 and i.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's the length of the vector
with components 1 and i?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What if I do this,
so n is just two.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm in C^2, two dimensional
space, complex space with the

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
vector whose components are 1
and i.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So if I took one times one and
i times i and added,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
z transpose z would be zero.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But I don't -- that vector is
not -- doesn't have length zero

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
-- the vector with the
components 1 and i -- this

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
multiplication --
what I really want is z1

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
conjugate z1.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You remember that z1 conjugate
z1 is -- so you see that first

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
step will be z1 conjugate z1,
which is the magnitude of z1

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
squared, which is what I want.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's, like,
three squared or five squared.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now, if it's --
if z1 is i, then I multiplied

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
by minus i gives one plus one,
so the component of length --

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the component i,
its modulus squared is plus

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
one.
That's great.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So what I want to do then is do
that -- I want z1 bar z1,

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
z2 bar z2, zn bar zn.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And remember that -- you
remember this complex conjugate.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So -- so there's the point.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now I can erase the no good and
put is good, because that now

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
gives the answer zero for the
zero vector, of course,

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,409
but it gives a positive length
squared for any other vector.

105
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,000
So it's a --
it's the right definition of

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
length, and essentially the
message is that we're always

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
going to be taking -- when we
transpose, we also take complex

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
conjugate.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So let's -- let's find the
length of one -- so the vector

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
one i, that's z,
that's that vector z.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now I take the conjugate of one
is one, the conjugate of i is

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
minus i.
I take this vector,
I get one plus one -- I get

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
two.
So that's a vector and that's a
vector of length -- square root

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of two.
Square root of two is the
length and not the zero that we

115
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,000
would have got from one minus i
squared.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.
So the message really is
whenever we transpose,

117
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,000
we also take conjugates.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So here's a symbol -- one
symbol to do both.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So that symbol H,
it stands for a guy named

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hermite, who didn't actually
pronounce the H,

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but let's pronounce it -- so I
would

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
call that z Hermitian z.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll -- let me write that word,
Herm- so his name was Hermite,

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and then we make it into an
adjective, Hermitian.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So z Hermitian z.
z H z.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.
So, that's the -- that's the,
length squared.

127
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,210
Now what's the inner product?

128
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, it should match.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The inner product of two
vectors -- so inner product is

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
no longer -- used to be y
transpose x.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's for real vectors.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For complex vectors,
whenever we transpose,

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
we also take the conjugate.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So it's y Hermitian x.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Of course it's not real
anymore, usually.

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That -- the inner product will
usually be complex number.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But if y and x are the same,
if they're the same z,

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,560
then we have z -- z H z,
we have the length squared,

139
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
and that's what we want,
the inner product of a vector

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
with itself should be its length
squared.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So this is, like,
forced on us because this is

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
forced on us.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So -- so this z -- this --
everybody's picking up what this

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
equals.

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is z1 squared plus zn
squared.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's the length squared.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And that's the inner product
that we have to go with.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So it could be a complex number
now.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
One more change.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, two more changes.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We've got to change the idea of
a symmetric matrix.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I'll just recap on symmetric
matrixes.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,790
Symmetric means A transpose
equals A, but not -- no good if

154
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,510
A is complex.

155
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,000
So what do we
instead -- that applies

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
perfectly to real matrixes.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But now if my matrixes were
complex, I want to take the

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
transpose and the conjugate to
equal A.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So there's -- that's the -- the
right complex version of

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
symmetry.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The com- the symmetry now means
when

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I transpose it,
flip across the diagonal and

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
take conjugates.

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, for example -- here would
be an example.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
On the diagonal,
it had better be real,

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
because when I flip it,
the diagonal is still there and

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
it has to -- and then when
I take the complex conjugate it

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
has to be still there,
so it better be a real number,

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
let me say two and five.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What about entries off the
diagonal?

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If this entry is,
say, three plus i,

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
then this entry had better be
-- because I want whatever this

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
--
when I transpose,

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
it'll show up here and i
conjugate.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,840
So I need three minus I there.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,000
So there's a matrix with --
that corresponds to symmetry,

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but it's complex.

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And those matrixes are called
Hermitian matrixes.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hermitian matrixes.

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
A H equals A.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Fine.
Okay, that's -- and those
matrixes have real eigenvalues

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and they have perpendicular
eigenvectors.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What does perpendicular mean?

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Perpendicular means the inner
product -- so let's go on to

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
perpendicular.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, when I had perpendicular
vectors, for example,

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
they were like q1,
q2 up to qn.

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,640
That's my -- q is my letter
that I use for perpendicular.

189
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,000
Actually, I usually -- I also
mean unit length.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So those are perpendicular unit
vectors.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But now what does -- so it's a
-- orthonormal basis,

192
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll still use those words,
but how do I compute

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,370
perpendicular?

194
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,000
How do I check perpendicular?

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This means that the inner
product of qi with qj -- but now

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I not only transpose,
I must conjugate,

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
right, to get zero if i is not
j and one if

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
i is j.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So it's a unit vector,
meaning unit length,

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
orthogonal -- all the angles
are right angles,

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but these are angles in complex
n dimensional space.

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's q1, q on- qi bar
transpose.

203
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Or, for short,
qi H qj.

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it will still be true --
so let me -- again I'll create

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a matrix out of those guys.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The matrix will have these q-s
in its columns,

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
q2 to qn.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I want to turn that into
matrix language,

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
just like before.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What does that mean?

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That means I want all these
inner products,

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
so I take these columns of Q,
multiply by their rows -- so it

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
was -- it used to be Q -- it
used to be Q transpose Q equals

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I, right?

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This was an orthogonal matrix.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But what's changed?

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,810
These are now complex vectors.

218
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:38,000
Their inner products are --
involve conjugating the first

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
factor.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's not --
it's the conjugate of Q

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
transpose.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,940
It's Q bar transpose Q.

223
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,000
Q H.

224
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So can I call this -- let me
call it Q H Q,

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which is I.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So that's our new -- you -- you
see I'm just translating,

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and the -- the book h- on one
page gives a little dictionary

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
of the right words in the real
case, R^n, and the corresponding

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,070
words in
the complex case for the vector

230
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,000
space C^n.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Of course, C^n is a vector
space, the numbers we multiply

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
are now complex numbers -- we're
just moving into complex n

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
dimensional space.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Now -- actually,
I have to say we changed the

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
word
symmet- symmetric to Hermitian

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for those matrixes.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
People also change this word
orthogonal into another word

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that happens to be unitary,
as a word that applies -- that

240
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
signals that we might be dealing
with a complex matrix here.

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So what's a unitary matrix?

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a -- it's just like an
orthogonal matrix.

243
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's a square,
n by n matrix with orthonormal

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
columns, perpendicular columns,
unit vectors -- unit vectors

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
computed by -- and
perpendicularity computed by

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
remembering that there's a
conjugate as well as a

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
transpose.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,190
Okay.

249
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,000
So those are the words.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Now I'm ready to get into the
substance of the lecture which

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
is the most famous complex
matrix, which happens to be one

252
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of these guys.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It has orthogonal columns,
and it's named after Fourier

254
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
because it comes into the
Fourier transform,

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
so it's the matrix that's all
around us.

256
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.
Let me tell you what it is
first of all in the n by n case.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,950
Then often I'll let n be four
because four is a good size to

258
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,000
work with.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But here's the n by n Fourier
matrix.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Its first column is the vector
of

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,680
ones.

262
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
It's n by n,
of course.

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,450
Its second column is the
powers, the -- actually,

264
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:34,000
better if I move from the math
department to EE for this one

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
half hour and then,
please, let me move back again.

266
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay.

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's the difference between
those two departments?

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,050
It's just math starts counting
with

269
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,430
one and electrical engineers
start counting at zero.

270
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,000
Actually, they're probably
right.

271
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So anyway, we'll give them --
humor them.

272
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So this is really the zeroes
column.

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And the first column up to the
n-1, that's the one inconvenient

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
spot in electrical engineering.

275
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,840
All these expressions start at
zero, no problem,

276
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,000
but they end at n-1.

277
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,140
Well, that's -- that's the
difficulty of Course 6.

278
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,000
So what's -- they're the powers
of a number that I'm going to

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
call W -- W squared,
W cubed, W to the -- now what

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
is the W here?

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What's the power?

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This was the zeroes power,
first power,

283
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,690
second power,
this will be n minus first

284
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,000
power.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's the column.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's the next column?

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's the powers of W squared,
W to the fourth,

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,780
W to the sixth,
W to the two n-1.

289
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,000
And then more columns and more
columns and more columns and

290
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
what's the last column?

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's the powers of -- let's
see.

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We -- actually,
if we look around rows,

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
w- this matrix is symmetric.

294
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's symmetric in the old not
quite perfect way,

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,310
not perfect because these
numbers are complex.

296
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,000
And so it's -- that first row
is all ones.

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
One W W squared up to W to the
n-1.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's the last column is the
powers of W to the n-1,

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so this guy matches that,
and finally we get W to

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
something
here.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I guess we could actually
figure out what that something

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is.

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,630
What are the entries of this
matrix?

304
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,000
The i j entry of this matrix
are -- I going to -- are you

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
going to allow me to let i go
from zero to n minus one?

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So i and g go from zero
to n-1.

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So the one -- the zero zero
entry is a one -- it's just this

308
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
same W guy to the power i times
j.

309
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's see.

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm jumping into formulas here
and I have to tell you what W is

311
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and then you know everything
about this matrix.

312
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So W is the -- well,
shall we finish here?

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,440
What was this -- this is the
(n-1) (n-1) entry.

314
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
This is W to the n-1 squared.

315
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Everything's looking like a
mess here, because we have --

316
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
not too bad, because all the
entries are powers of W.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,040
There -- none of them are zero.

318
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,000
This is a full matrix.

319
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But W is a very special number.

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
W is the special number whose
n-th power is one.

321
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In fact -- well,
actually, there are n numbers

322
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
like that.

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
One of them is one,
of course.

324
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But the one we --
the W we want is -- the angle

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,890
is two pi over n.

326
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,000
Is that what I mean?
n over two pi.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
No, two pi over n.

328
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
W is E to the I and the angle
is two pi over n.

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Right.

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Where is this W in the complex
plane?

331
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,450
It's -- it's on the unit
circle,

332
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,000
right?

333
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is -- it's the cosine of
two pi over n plus I times the

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
sine of two pi over n.

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But actually,
forget this.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's never good to work with
the real and imaginary parts,

337
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the rectangular coordinates,
when we're taking powers.

338
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
To take that to the tenth
power, we can't see what we're

339
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
doing.

340
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
To take this form to the tenth
power, we see immediately what

341
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,560
we're doing.

342
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,000
It would be e to the i 20 pi
over n.

343
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So when our matrix is full of
powers -- so it's this formula,

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and where is this on the
complex plain?

345
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Here are the real numbers,
here's the imaginary axis,

346
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
here's the unit circle of
radius one, and this number is

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
on the unit circle at this
angle, which is one n-th of the

348
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
full way round.

349
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So if I drew,
for example,

350
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
n equals six,
this would be e to the two pi,

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
two pi over six,
it would be one sixth of the

352
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
way around, it would be 60
degrees.

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And where is W squared?

354
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So I -- my W is e to the two pi
I over six in this case,

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in this six by -- for the six
by six Fourier transform,

356
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
it's totally constructed out of
this

357
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
number and its powers.

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So what are its powers?

359
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, its powers are on the
unit circle, right?

360
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because when I square a number,
a complex number,

361
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,570
I square its absolute value,
which gives me one again.

362
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,000
All the powers have -- are on
the unit circle.

363
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And the -- the angle gets
doubled to a hundred and twenty,

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so there's W squared,
there's W cubed,

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
there's W to the fourth,
there's W to the fifth and

366
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
there is W to the sixth,
as we hoped,

367
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
W to the sixth coming back to
one.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So those are the six -- can I
say this on TV?

369
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The six sixth roots of one,
and it's this one,

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the primitive one we say,
the first one,

371
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
which is W.

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, so what -- let me change
-- let me -- I said I would

373
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
probably switch to n equal four.

374
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What's W for that?

375
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's the fourth root of one.

376
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
W to the fourth will be one.

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,890
W will be e to the two pi i
over

378
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,000
four now.

379
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What's that?

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is e to the i pi over two.

381
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This is a quarter of the way
around the unit circle,

382
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and that's exactly i,
a quarter of the way around.

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And sure enough,
the powers are i,

384
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
i squared, which is minus one,
i cubed,

385
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
which is minus i and finally i
to the fourth which is one,

386
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
right.

387
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So there's W,
W squared, W cubed,

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
W to the fourth -- I'm really
ready to write down this Fourier

389
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
matrix for the four by four
case, just so we see that

390
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
clearly.

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Let me do it here.

392
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
F4 is -- all right,
one one one one one one one W

393
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
-- it's I.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I squared.

395
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's minus one.
i cubed is minus i.

396
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll -- I could write i squared
and i cubed.

397
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Why don't I,
just so we see the pattern for

398
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
sure.
i squared,

399
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,490
i cubed, i squared,
i cubed, i fourth,

400
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,000
i sixth -- i fourth,
i sixth and i ninth.

401
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You see the exponents fall in
this nice -- the exponent is the

402
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
row number times the column
number, always starting at zero.

403
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay.
And now I can put in those
numbers if you like -- one one

404
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
one one,
one i minus one minus i,

405
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
one minus one,
one minus one and one minus i

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
minus one i.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,000
No.
Yes.

408
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Right.

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,560
What's -- why do I think that
matrix is so remarkable?

410
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:44,000
It's the four by four matrix
that comes into the four point

411
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Fourier transform.

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
When we want to find the
Fourier

413
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
transform, the four point
Fourier transform of a vector

414
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
with four components,
we want to multiply by this F4

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
or we want to multiply by F4
inverse.

416
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,610
One way we're taking the
transform, one way we're taking

417
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,000
the inverse transform.

418
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,290
Actually, they're so close that
it's

419
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,000
easy to confuse the two.

420
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,330
The inverse of this matrix will
be a nice matrix also.

421
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,000
So -- and that's,
of course, what makes it --

422
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
that -- I guess Fourier knew
that.

423
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He knew the inverse of this
matrix.

424
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
A- as you'll see,
it just comes from the fact

425
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that the
columns are orthogonal -- from

426
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
the fact that the columns are
orthogonal, we will quickly

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
figure out what is the inverse.

428
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What Fourier didn't know --
didn't notice -- I think Gauss

429
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
noticed it but didn't make a
point of it and then

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
it turned out to be really
important was the fact that this

431
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
matrix is so special that you
can break it up into nice pieces

432
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
with lots of zeroes,
factors that have lots of

433
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,660
zeroes and multiply by it or by
its inverse very,

434
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,000
very fast.

435
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay.
But how did it get into this
lecture first?

436
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Because the columns are
orthogonal.

437
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Can I just check that the
columns of this matrix are

438
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
orthogonal?

439
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So the inner product of that
column with that column is zero.

440
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The inner product of column one
with column three is zero.

441
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
How about the inner product of
two and four?

442
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Can I take the inner product of
column two

443
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,660
with column four?

444
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,000
Or even the inner product of
two with three,

445
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
let's -- let's see,
does that -- let me do two and

446
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,000
four.
Okay.

447
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What -- oh, I see,
yes, hmm.

448
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Hmm.
Let's see, I believe that those
two columns are

449
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
orthogonal.

450
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So let me take their inner
product and hope to get zero.

451
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, now if you hadn't
listened to the first half of

452
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
this lecture,
when you took the inner product

453
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
of that with that,
you would have multiplied one

454
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
by one, i by minus i,
and that would have given you

455
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
one,
minus one by minus one would

456
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
have given you another one minus
I by I would have been minus I

457
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
squared, that's another one.

458
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,980
So do I conclude that the inner
product of columns -- I said

459
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,000
columns two and four,
that's because I forgot those

460
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
are columns one and three.

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm interested in their inner
product and I'm hoping it's

462
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,060
zero, but it doesn't look like
zero.

463
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,000
Nevertheless,
it is zero.

464
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Those columns are
perpendicular.

465
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Why?

466
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Because the inner product -- we
conjugate.

467
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Do you remember that the -- one
of the vectors in the inner

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
product has to get conjugated.

469
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So when I conjugated,
it changes that i to a minus i,

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,760
changes this to a plus i,
changes those -- that second

471
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,000
sine and that fourth sine and I
do get zero.

472
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So those columns are
orthogonal.

473
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So columns are orthogonal.

474
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They're not quite orthonormal.

475
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,330
But I could fix that easily.

476
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,000
They -- all those columns have
length two.

477
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Length squared is four,
like this -- the four I had

478
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
there -- this length squared,
one plus -- one squared one

479
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
squared one squared one squared
is four, square root is two --

480
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
so if I really wanted them --
suppose I really wanted to fix

481
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
life perfectly,
I could divide by two,

482
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,500
and now I have columns that are
actually orthonormal.

483
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,000
So what?

484
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I can invert right away,
right?

485
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
O- orthonormal columns means --
now I'm keeping this one half in

486
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
here for the
moment -- c- means F4

487
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Hermitian, can I use that,
conjugate transpose times F4 is

488
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,000
i.
So I see what the inverse is.

489
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The inverse of F4 is -- it's
just like an -- an orthogonal

490
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
matrix.

491
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The inverse is the transpose --
here the inverse is the

492
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
conjugate transpose.

493
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So, fine.
That -- that tells me that
anything good that I learn about

494
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
F4 I'll know the same -- I'll
know a similar fact about its

495
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
inverse, because its inverse is
just its conjugate transpose.

496
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay, now -- so what's good?

497
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, first,
the columns are orthogonal.

498
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That's a key fact,
then.

499
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's the thing that makes the
inverse easy.

500
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But what property is it that
leads to the fast Fourier

501
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
transform?

502
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So now I'm going to talk,
in these last minutes,

503
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
about the fast Fourier
transform.

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What -- here's the idea.

505
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
F6, our six by six matrix,
will c- there's a neat

506
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
connection to F3,
half as big.

507
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
There's a connection of F8 to
F4.

508
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
There's a connection of F(64)
to F(32).

509
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Shall I write down what that
connection is?

510
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What's the connection of F(64)
to F(32)?

511
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So F(64) is a 64 by 64 matrix
whose W is the 64th root of one.

512
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,560
So it's one 64th of the way
round in F(64).

513
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,000
And it -- do- and F(32) is a 32
by 32 matrix.

514
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Remember, they're different
sizes.

515
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And the W in that 32 by 32
matrix is the 32nd root of one,

516
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
which is twice as far --
that -- you sh- see that key

517
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
point -- that's the -- that's
how 32 and 64 are connected in

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
the Ws.

519
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The W for 64 is one 64th of the
way -- so all I'm saying is that

520
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
if I square the W -- W(64),
that's what I'm using for the

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
one over -- the -- W sixty f-
this Wn is either the i two pi

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,830
over n --
so W(64) is one 64th of the way

523
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,000
around it.

524
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
When I square that,
what do I get but W(32)?

525
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Right?
If I square this matrix,
I double the angle -- if I

526
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
square this number,
I double the angle,

527
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I get, the -- the W(32).

528
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So somehow there's a little
hope

529
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
here to connect F(64) with
F(32).

530
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And here's the connection.

531
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Okay.
Let me -- let me go back,
-- yes, let me -- I'll do it

532
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
here.

533
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Here's the connection.

534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
F(64).

535
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The 64 by 64 Fourier matrix is
connected to two copies of

536
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
F(32).

537
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Let me leave a little space for
the connection.

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So this is 64 by 64.

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Here's a matrix of that same
size,

540
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
because it's got two copies of
F(32) and two zero matrixes.

541
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Those zero matrixes are the
key, because when I multiply by

542
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
this matrix, just as it is,
regular multiplication,

543
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I would take -- need 64 -- I
would -- I would have 64 squared

544
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
little multiplications to do.

545
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But this matrix is half zero.

546
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Well, of course,
the two aren't equal.

547
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm going to put an equals
sign, but there has to be some

548
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
fix up factors -- one there and
one there -- to make it true.

549
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The beauty is that these fix up
factors will be really -- almost

550
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
all zeroes.

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So that as soon as we get this
formula right,

552
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,490
we've got a great idea for how
to get from the sixty- from the

553
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,000
64 squared calculations -- so
this original -- originally we

554
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,750
have 64 squared calculations
from there, but this one will

555
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,000
give us -- this is -- this will
--

556
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
we don't need that many -- we
only need two times 32 squared,

557
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
because we've got that twice.

558
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And -- plus the fix-up.

559
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So I have to tell you what's in
this fix-up matrix.

560
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The one on the right is
actually a permutation matrix,

561
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
a very simple odds and evens
permutation matrix,

562
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,530
the --
ones show up -- I haven't put

563
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:04,000
enough ones, I really need a --
32 of these guys at -- double

564
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
space and then -- you see it's
-- it's a permutation matrix.

565
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What it does -- shall I call it
P for permutation matrix?

566
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So what that P does when it
multiplies a vector,

567
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it takes the odd -- the even
numbered components first and

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
then the odds.

569
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You see this -- this one
skipping every time is going to

570
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,760
pick out x0, x2,
x4, x6 and then below that will

571
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,000
come --
will pick out x1,

572
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
x3, x5.

573
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And of course,
that can be hard wired in the

574
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
computer to be instantaneous.

575
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So that says -- so far,
what have we said?

576
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,310
We're saying that the 64 by 64
Fourier matrix is really

577
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,000
separated into --
separate your vector into the

578
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
odd -- into the even components
and the odd components,

579
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
then do a 32 size Fourier
transform onto those separately,

580
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and then put the pieces
together again.

581
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So the pieces -- putting them
together turns them out

582
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to be I and a diagonal matrix
and I and a minus,

583
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that same diagonal matrix.

584
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So the fix-up cost is really
the cost of multiplying by D,

585
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
this diagonal matrix,
because there's essentially no

586
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,110
cost in -- in the I part or in
the permutation part,

587
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,000
so really it's -- the fix-up
cost is

588
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
essentially because D is
diagonal -- is 32

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
multiplications.

590
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That's the -- there you're
seeing -- of course we didn't

591
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
check the formula or we didn't
even say what D is yet,

592
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
but I will -- this diagonal
matrix D is powers of W -- one W

593
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
W squared down to W to the 31st.

594
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So you see that when I -- to do
a multiplication by D,

595
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I need to do 32
multiplications.

596
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
There they are.

597
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Then -- but the other,
the more serious work is to do

598
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
the F(32) twice on the --
separately on the even numbered

599
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and odd numbered components,
so twice 32 squared.

600
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So 64 squared is gone now.

601
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And that's the new count.

602
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay, great,
but what next?

603
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So that's -- I -- we now have
the key idea -- we would have to

604
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
check the algebra,
but it's just checking a lot of

605
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
sums that come out correctly.

606
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is right --
the right way to see the fast

607
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Fourier transform,
or one right way to see it.

608
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Then you've got to see what's
the next idea.

609
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The next idea is to break the
32s down.

610
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Break those 32s down.

611
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So we have this factor,
and now we have the F(32),

612
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,590
but that breaks into some guy
here -- F thirty- F six- F(16)

613
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,000
-- F(16).

614
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Each -- each F(32) is breaking
into two copies of F(16),

615
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and then we have a permutation
and then the -- so this is a --

616
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,950
like, this was a 64 size
permutation, this is a 32 size

617
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,000
permutation -- I guess I've got
it twice.

618
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So it's -- I'm --
I'm just using the same idea

619
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
recursively -- recursion is the
key word -- that on each of

620
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
those F(32)s -- so here's zero
zero -- it's just -- to get

621
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
F(32) -- this is the odd even
permutations -- so you see,

622
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
we're -- the combination of
those permutations,

623
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
what's it doing?

624
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This guy separates into odds --
in -- into evens and odds,

625
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and then this guy separates the
evens into the ones -- the

626
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
numbers that are mult- the even
evens, which means zero four

627
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
eight sixteen -- and even odds,
which means two,

628
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
six, ten, fourteen -- and then
odd evens and

629
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,650
odd odds.

630
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,000
You see, together these
permutations then break it --

631
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
break our vector down into x,
even even and three other

632
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
pieces.

633
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Those are the four pieces that
separately get multiplied by

634
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
F(16) -- separately fixed up by
these Is and Ds and Is and minus

635
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Ds -- so this count is now
reduced.

636
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,610
This count is now -- what's it
reduced to?

637
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:26,000
So that's going to be gone,
because 32 squared -- that's --

638
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that's the change I'm making,
right?

639
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The 32 squared -- w- so -- so
it's this that's now reduced.

640
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So I still have two times it,
but now what's 32 squared?

641
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's gone in favor of two
sixteen squareds plus sixteen.

642
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's -- and then the original
32 to fix.

643
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Maybe you see what's happening.

644
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Even easier than this formula
is w- what's -- when I do the

645
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
recursion more and more times,
I get simpler and simpler

646
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
factors in
the middle.

647
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Eventually I'll be down to two
point or one point Fourier

648
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
transforms.

649
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But I get more and more factors
piling up on the right and left.

650
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
On the right,
I'm just getting permutation

651
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,000
matrixes.
On the left,
I'm getting these guys,

652
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,000
these Is and Ds,
so that there was a 32 there

653
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and -- each one of these is
costing 32.

654
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Each one of those is costing

655
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,400


656
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,000
And how many will there be?

657
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So you see the 32 for this
original fix up,

658
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
because D had 32 numbers,
32 for this next fix up,

659
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
because D has 16 and 16 more.

660
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,010
I keep going.

661
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,000
So the count in the middle goes
down to zip, but these fix up

662
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
counts are all that I'm left
with, and how many factors --

663
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
how many fix-ups have I got --
log in -- from 64,

664
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
one step to 32,
one step to 16,

665
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
one step to eight,
four, two and one.

666
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Six steps.

667
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So I have six fix-up --
six fix up factors.

668
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Finally I get to six times the

669
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000


670
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That's my final count.

671
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Instead of 64 squared,
this is log to the base two of

672
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,360
64 times 64 -- actually,
half of 64.

673
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:49,330
So actually,
the final count is n log to the

674
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:56,000
base two of n -- that's the 32
-- a half.

675
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So can I put a box around that
wonderful, extremely important

676
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,970
and satisfying conclusion --
that the fast Fourier transform

677
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:15,000
multiplies by an n by n matrix,
but it does it not in n squared

678
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
steps, but in one half n log n
steps.

679
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And if we just -- complete by
doing a count,

680
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
let's suppose -- suppose -- a
typical case would be two to the

681
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000
tenth.
Now n squared is bigger than a
million.

682
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,350
So it's a thousand twenty four
times a thousand twenty four.

683
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:51,000
But what is n -- what is one
half -- what is the new count,

684
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
done the right way?

685
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's n -- the thousand twenty
four times one half,

686
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and what's the logarithm?

687
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's ten.

688
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So times ten over two.

689
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,360
So it's five times -- it's five
times a thousand twenty four,

690
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,000
where this one was a thousand
twenty four times a thousand

691
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
twenty four.

692
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
We've reduced the calculation
by a

693
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
factor of 200 just by factoring
the matrix properly.

694
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This was a thousand times n,
we're now down to five times n.

695
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So we can do 200 Fourier
transforms, where before we

696
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
could do one,
and in real scientific

697
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,780
calculations where Fourier
transforms are happening all the

698
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,000
time, we're saving a factor of

699
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
in one of the major steps of
modern scientific computing.

700
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,070
So that's the idea of the fast
Fourier transform,

701
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,870
and you see the whole thing
hinged on being a special matrix

702
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,000
with orthonormal columns.

703
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay, that's actually it for
complex numbers.

704
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm back next time really to --
to real numbers,

705
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
eigenvalues and eigenvectors
and the key idea of positive

706
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
definite matrixes is going to
show up.

707
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What's a positive definite
matrix?

708
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And it's terrific that this
course is going to reach

709
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
positive definiteness,
because those are the matrixes

710
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,670
that you see the most in
applications.

711
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,000
Okay, see you next time.

712
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Thanks.
