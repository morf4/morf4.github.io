2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Hi.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the first lecture
in MIT's course 18.06,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
linear algebra, and
I'm Gilbert Strang.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,360
The text for the
course is this book,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,000
Introduction to Linear Algebra.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,040
And the course web page, which
has got a lot of exercises from

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,285
the past, MatLab codes, the
syllabus for the course,

9
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,000
is web.mit.edu/18.06.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,970
And this is the first
lecture, lecture one.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,000
So, and later we'll give the
web address for viewing these,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
videotapes.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, so what's in
the first lecture?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is my plan.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The fundamental problem
of linear algebra,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is to solve a system
of linear equations.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,328
So let's start
with a case when we

18
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:14,000
have some number of equations,
say n equations and n unknowns.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So an equal number of
equations and unknowns.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's the normal, nice case.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,082
And what I want to do is --
with examples, of course --

22
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:31,020
to describe, first, what
I call the Row picture.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,000
That's the picture of
one equation at a time.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,632
It's the picture you've
seen before in two

25
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:42,000
by two equations
where lines meet.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So in a minute, you'll
see lines meeting.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,108
The second picture,
I'll put a star

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,030
beside that, because that's
such an important one.

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,000
And maybe new to you is the
picture -- a column at a time.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And those are the rows
and columns of a matrix.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,564
So the third -- the algebra
way to look at the problem is

32
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:12,000
the matrix form and using
a matrix that I'll call A.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, so can I do an example?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The whole semester will be
examples and then see what's

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
going on with the example.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
So, take an example.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,800
Two equations, two unknowns.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,000
So let me take 2x
-y =0, let's say.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And -x 2y=3.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Okay. let me -- I can
even say right away --

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:50,000
what's the matrix, that is,
what's the coefficient matrix?

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The matrix that involves
these numbers --

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a matrix is just a
rectangular array of numbers.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,455
Here it's two rows and
two columns, so 2 and --

45
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:10,000
minus 1 in the first row minus
1 and 2 in the second row,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that's the matrix.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the right hand --
the, unknown -- well,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we've got two unknowns.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,284
So we've got a vector, with
two components, x and y,

50
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:29,333
and we've got two right hand
sides that go into a vector

51
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,000
0 3.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,500
I couldn't resist writing
the matrix form, right --

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
even before the pictures.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I always will think
of this as the matrix A,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,928
the matrix of coefficients,
then there's a vector of

56
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:46,428
unknowns.

57
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:49,000
Here we've only
got two unknowns.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,267
And that vector of
unknowns, well I'll often --

60
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll make that x -- extra bold.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,900
A and the right hand
side is also a vector

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,000
that I'll always call b.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,284
So linear equations are A
x equal b and the idea now

64
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:11,816
is to solve this
particular example

65
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:17,000
and then step back to
see the bigger picture.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, what's the picture for
this example, the Row picture?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, so here comes
the Row picture.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,950
So that means I take
one row at a time

69
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,440
and I'm drawing
here the xy plane

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,985
and I'm going to plot
all the points that

71
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:43,000
satisfy that first equation.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x y =0.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's often good to start with
which point on the horizontal

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
line -- on this horizontal
line, y is zero.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,400
The x axis has y as zero and
that -- in this case, actually,

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,000
then x is zero.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,500
So the point, the origin -- the
point with coordinates (0,0) is

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
on the line.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It solves that equation.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,500
Okay, tell me in -- well,
I guess I have to tell you

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,000
another point that solves
this same equation.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me suppose x is one,
so I'll take x to be one.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then y should be two, right?

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So there's the point one two
that also solves this equation.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I could put in more points.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,448
But, but let me put
in all the points

87
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:48,000
at once, because they all
lie on a straight line.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,997
This is a linear equation
and that word linear

89
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:51,792
got the letters

90
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, thanks. for line in it.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's the equation --
this is the line that ...

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of solutions to 2x y=0 my
first row, first equation.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So typically, maybe, x equal
a half, y equal one will work.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And sure enough it does.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, that's the first one.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now the second one is not
going to go through the origin.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's always important.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Do we go through
the origin or not?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In this case, yes, because
there's a zero over there.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In this case we don't
go through the origin,

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
because if x and y are
zero, we don't get three.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,213
So, let me again say
suppose y is zero,

103
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,000
what x do we actually get?

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If y is zero, then I
get x is minus three.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So if y is zero, I
go along minus three.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,590
So there's one point
on this second line.

107
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,000
Now let me say, well,
suppose x is minus one --

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
just to take another x.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
If x is minus one,
then this is a one

110
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,000
and I think y should be a one,
because if x is minus one,

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
then I think y should be a
one and we'll get that point.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,850
Is that right?

113
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,000
If x is minus one, that's a one.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,750
If y is a one, that's
a two and the one

115
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,500
and the two make three and
that point's on the equation.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,984
Now, I should just
draw the line, right,

118
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,554
connecting those
two points at --

119
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,000
that will give me
the whole line.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And if I've done
this reasonably well,

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think it's going to happen
to go through -- well,

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
not happen -- it was arranged
to go through that point.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,280
So I think that the
second line is this one,

124
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,000
and this is the all important
point that lies on both lines.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,688
Shall we just check
that that point which

126
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:01,000
is the point x equal one
and y was two, right?

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,430
That's the point there
and that, I believe,

128
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,000
solves both equations.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's just check this.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If x is one, I have a minus one
plus four equals three, okay.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,885
Apologies for
drawing this picture

132
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:25,000
that you've seen before.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,284
But this -- seeing the row
picture -- first of all,

134
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,815
for n equal 2, two
equations and two unknowns,

135
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:36,000
it's the right place to start.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,917
Okay.

137
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,000
So we've got the solution.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The point that
lies on both lines.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now can I come to
the column picture?

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Pay attention, this
is the key point.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So the column picture.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm now going to look at
the columns of the matrix.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to look at
this part and this part.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,333
I'm going to say that the x part
is really x times -- you see,

145
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:04,416
I'm putting the two -- I'm kind
of getting the two equations

146
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:11,000
at once -- that part and then
I have a y and in the first

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,908
equation it's multiplying a
minus one and in the second

148
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:21,670
equation a two, and on the
right hand side, zero and three.

149
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,630
You see, the columns of the
matrix, the columns of A

150
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,000
are here and the right
hand side b is there.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And now what is the
equation asking for?

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's asking us to find --
somehow to combine that vector

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and this one in the right
amounts to get that one.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,450
It's asking us to find the
right linear combination --

155
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,000
this is called a
linear combination.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And it's the most fundamental
operation in the whole course.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a linear combination
of the columns.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's what we're
seeing on the left side.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Again, I don't want to
write down a big definition.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You can see what it is.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's column one,
there's column two.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I multiply by some
numbers and I add.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,500
That's a combination -- a linear
combination and I want to make

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,000
those numbers the right
numbers to produce zero three.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now I want to draw a picture
that, represents what this --

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
this is algebra.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,720
What's the geometry, what's
the picture that goes with it?

169
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,220
Okay.

170
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,000
So again, these vectors
have two components,

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
so I better draw a
picture like that.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So can I put down these columns?

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,331
I'll draw these
columns as they are,

174
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:55,000
and then I'll do a
combination of them.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So the first column is over
two and down one, right?

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So there's the first column.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The first column.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Column one.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's the vector two minus one.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,413
The second column is -- minus
one is the first component

181
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,000
and up two.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's here.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's column two.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So this, again, you see
what its components are.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Its components are
minus one, two.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Good.

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
That's this guy.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now I have to take
a combination.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What combination shall I take?

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,928
Why not the right
combination, what the hell?

191
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:49,428
Okay.

192
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:52,424
So the combination
I'm going to take

193
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:55,726
is the right one to
produce zero three

194
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:59,000
and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,284
So the right combination is
to take x as one of those

196
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:05,490
and two of these.

197
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:11,000
It's because we already know
that that's the right x and y,

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,901
so why not take the correct
combination here and see it

199
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,400
happen?

200
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, so how do I picture
this linear combination?

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,330
So I start with this vector
that's already here --

202
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,000
so that's one of column one,
that's one times column one,

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
right there.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,576
vector onto the front of the
arrow will start the next

206
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,000
vector and it will go this way.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So let's see, can I do it right?

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,456
If I added on one
of these vectors,

209
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:47,663
it would go left one and up two,
so we'd go left one and up two,

210
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:51,000
so it would probably
get us to there.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe I'll do dotted
line for that.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay?

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's one of column
two tucked onto the end,

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
but I wanted to tuck
on two of column two.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,961
So that -- the second one --
we'll go up left one and up two

216
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,460
also.

217
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,300
It'll probably end there.

218
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,000
And there's another one.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So what I've put in here
is two of column two.

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Added on.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And where did I end up?

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What are the coordinates
of this result?

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What do I get when I take
one of this plus two of that?

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I do get that, of course.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There it is, x is zero,
y is three, that's b.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's the answer we wanted.

227
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And how do I do it?

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You see I do it just
like the first component.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I have a two and a minus
two that produces a zero,

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and in the second component I
have a minus one and a four,

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
they combine to give the three.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But look at this picture.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So here's our key picture.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I combine this column and
this column to get this guy.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That was the b.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's the zero three.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,641
Okay.

238
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:17,770
So that idea of linear
combination is crucial,

239
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:23,000
and also -- do we want to
think about this question?

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sure, why not.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What are all the combinations?

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If I took -- can I
go back to xs and ys?

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,800
This is a question for really
-- it's going to come up over

244
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
and over, but why don't
we see it once now?

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If I took all the xs and all
the ys, all the combinations,

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
what would be all the results?

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
And, actually, the
result would be

248
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,960
that I could get any
right hand side at all.

249
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,708
The combinations
of this and this

250
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,000
would fill the whole plane.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You can tuck that away.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We'll, explore it further.

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But this idea of what linear
combination gives b and what do

254
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
all the linear
combinations give,

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
what are all the possible,
achievable right hand sides be

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,780
-- that's going to be basic.

257
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,280
Okay.

258
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,000
Can I move to three
equations and three unknowns?

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because it's easy to
picture the two by two case.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let me do a three
by three example.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay, I'll sort of
start it the same way,

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,500
say maybe 2x y and maybe I'll
take no zs as a zero and maybe

263
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,110
a -x 2y and maybe
a -z as a -- oh,

264
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:02,996
let me make that a minus one
and, just for variety let me

265
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:09,360
take, -3z, -3ys, I should
keep the ys in that line,

266
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,000
and 4zs is, say, 4.

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's three equations.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm in three
dimensions, x, y, z.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And, I don't have
a solution yet.

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,875
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.

272
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,375
Okay.

273
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,000
So how do I you understand them?

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The row picture one way.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The column picture is
another very important way.

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,500
Just let's remember
the matrix form, here,

277
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,000
because that's easy.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The matrix form --
what's our matrix A?

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Our matrix A is this right hand
side, the two and the minus one

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,641
and the zero from the first
row, the minus one and the two

281
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:59,000
and the minus one
from the second row,

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the zero, the minus three and
the four from the third row.

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So it's a three by three matrix.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Three equations, three unknowns.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And what's our right-hand side?

286
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Of course, it's the vector,
zero minus one, four.

287
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,278
So that's the way, well, that's
the short hand to write out

289
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,000
the three equations.

290
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But it's the picture that
I'm looking for today.

291
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,960
Okay, so the row picture.

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,000
All right, so I'm in
three dimensions, x,

293
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
find out when there isn't
a solution. y and z.

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,970
And I want to take those
equations one at a time and ask

295
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:55,000
-- and make a picture of all
the points that satisfy --

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
let's take equation number two.

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,284
If I make a picture of all
the points that satisfy --

298
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:05,000
all the x, y, z points that
solve this equation -- well,

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
first of all, the origin
is not one of them.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0
would not solve that equation.

301
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So what are some points
that do solve the equation?

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's see, maybe if x is
one, y and z could be zero.

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That would work, right?

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So there's one point.

305
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,426
I'm looking at this
second equation,

306
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:32,000
here, just, to start with.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's see.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Also, I guess, if
z could be one,

309
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
x and y could be zero,
so that would just

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,380
go straight up that axis.

311
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,000
And, probably I'd want
a third point here.

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let me take x to be
zero, z to be zero,

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
then y would be
minus a half, right?

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So there's a third point,
somewhere -- oh my -- okay.

315
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,856
Let's see.

316
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to put in all the points
that satisfy that equation.

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Do you know what that
bunch of points will be?

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a plane.

319
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If we have a linear
equation, then, fortunately,

320
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,800
the graph of the thing, the plot
of all the points that solve it

321
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
are a plane.

322
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,270
These three points
determine a plane,

323
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,416
but your lecturer
is not Rembrandt

324
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:41,000
and the art is going to
be the weak point here.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So I'm just going to
draw a plane, right?

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There's a plane somewhere.

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's my plane.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That plane is all the
points that solves this guy.

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Then, what about this one?

330
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Two x minus y plus zero z.

331
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So z actually can be anything.

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Again, it's going
to be another plane.

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,072
Each row in a three
by three problem

334
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:12,750
gives us a plane in
three dimensions.

335
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,600
So this one is going to
be some other plane --

336
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,000
maybe I'll try to
draw it like this.

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And those two planes
meet in a line.

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,830
So if I have two equations,
just the first two

339
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,000
equations in three dimensions,
those give me a line.

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,730
The line where those
two planes meet.

341
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,000
And now, the third
guy is a third plane.

342
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And it goes somewhere.

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay, those three
things meet in a point.

344
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Now I don't know where
that point is, frankly.

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But -- linear
algebra will find it.

346
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,713
The main point is that the three
planes, because they're not

347
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,000
parallel, they're not special.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,450
They do meet in one point
and that's the solution.

349
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,240
But, maybe you can see
that this row picture is

350
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,000
getting a little hard to see.

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,885
The row picture was a cinch
when we looked at two lines

352
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:21,384
meeting.

353
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:24,072
When we look at
three planes meeting,

354
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:29,000
it's not so clear and in
four dimensions probably

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
a little less clear.

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,200
So, can I quit on
the row picture?

357
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,520
Or quit on the row picture
before I've successfully

358
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,000
found the point where
the three planes meet?

359
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,532
All I really want to see is
that the row picture consists

360
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:54,000
of three planes and, if
everything works right,

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
three planes meet in one
point and that's a solution.

362
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Now, you can tell I
prefer the column picture.

363
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, so let me take
the column picture.

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,070
That's x times -- so there were
two xs in the first equation

365
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,000
minus one x is, and
no xs in the third.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's just the first
column of that.

367
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And how many ys are there?

368
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,500
There's minus one in the first
equations, two in the second

369
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,000
and maybe minus
three in the third.

370
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Just the second
column of my matrix.

371
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And z times no zs minus
one zs and four zs.

372
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,270
And it's those three
columns, right,

373
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,496
that I have to combine to
produce the right hand side,

374
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:48,000
which is zero minus one four.

375
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,870
So what have we got on
this left hand side?

377
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,000
A linear combination.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's a linear combination
now of three vectors,

379
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and they happen to be -- each
one is a three dimensional

380
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,500
vector, so we want to know
what combination of those three

381
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
vectors produces that one.

382
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,640
Shall I try to draw the
column picture, then?

383
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,080
So, since these vectors
have three components --

384
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,744
so it's some multiple -- let
me draw in the first column

385
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:25,000
as before -- x is two
and y is minus one.

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Maybe there is the first column.

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,332
y -- the second column has maybe
a minus one and a two and the y

388
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:42,000
is a minus three, somewhere,
there possibly, column two.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And the third column has
-- no zero minus one four,

390
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
so how shall I draw that?

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So this was the first component.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,730
The second component
was a minus one.

393
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,000
Maybe up here.

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's column three, that's the
column zero minus one and four.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This guy.

396
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So, again, what's my problem?

397
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,304
What this equation
is asking me to do

398
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:18,666
is to combine
these three vectors

399
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:24,000
with a right combination
to produce this one.

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,800
Well, you can see what the
right combination is, because

401
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,110
in this special problem,
specially chosen

402
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:40,620
by the lecturer, that right
hand side that I'm trying to get

403
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,770
is actually one
of these columns.

404
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,000
So I know how to get that one.

405
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So what's the solution?

406
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What combination will work?

407
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I just want one of
these and none of these.

408
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So x should be zero, y
should be zero and z should

409
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,800
be one.

410
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
That's the combination.

411
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
One of those is
obviously the right one.

412
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Column three is
actually the same

413
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,650
as b in this particular problem.

414
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,349
I made it work
that way just so we

415
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:19,400
would get an answer,
(0,0,1), so somehow that's

416
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,428
the point where those
three planes met

417
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:26,000
and I couldn't see it before.

418
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Of course, I won't always be
able to see it from the column

419
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
picture, either.

420
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,220
It's the next lecture, actually,
which is about elimination,

421
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,800
which is the systematic
way that everybody --

422
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,000
every bit of software,
too -- production,

423
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
large scale software
would solve the equations.

424
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So the lecture that's coming up.

425
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,852
If I was to add that
to the syllabus,

426
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:05,000
will be about how to find
x, y, z in all cases.

427
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Can I just think again,
though, about the big picture?

428
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,071
By the big picture I mean
let's keep this same matrix

429
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:23,470
on the left but imagine that
we have a different right hand

430
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,120
side.

431
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, let me take a
different right hand side.

432
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,541
So I'll change that
right hand side

433
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:35,000
to something that actually
is also pretty special.

434
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Let me change it to -- if I
add those first two columns,

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
that would give me a one
and a one and a minus three.

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
There's a very special
right hand side.

437
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,880
I just cooked it up by
adding this one to this one.

438
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,170
Now, what's the solution with
this new right hand side?

439
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,000
The solution with this new
right hand side is clear.

440
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
took one of these
and none of those.

441
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So actually, it just
changed around to this

442
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
when I took this
new right hand side.

443
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,545
Okay.

444
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:17,000
So in the row picture, I
have three different planes,

445
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
three new planes meeting
now at this point.

446
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
In the column picture, I
have the same three columns,

447
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
but now I'm combining
them to produce this guy,

448
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and it turned out that column
one plus column two which would

449
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,456
be somewhere -- there
is the right column --

450
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:45,875
one of this and one of this
would give me the new b.

451
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,375
Okay.

452
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:49,000
So we squeezed in
an extra example.

453
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,750
But now think about all
bs, all right hand sides.

454
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:02,060
Can I solve these equations
for every right hand side?

455
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,370
Can I ask that question?

456
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,000
So that's the algebra question.

457
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Can I solve A x=b for every b?

458
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let me write that down.

459
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Can I solve A x =b for
every right hand side b?

460
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I mean, is there a solution?

461
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,178
And then, if there
is, elimination

462
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:31,000
will give me a way to find it.

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,267
I really wanted to ask,
is there a solution

464
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:37,000
for every right-hand side?

465
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,330
So now, can I put that
in different words --

466
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,000
in this linear
combination words?

467
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,900
So in linear combination words,
do the linear combinations

468
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:00,000
of the columns fill
three dimensional space?

469
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Every b means all the bs
in three dimensional space.

470
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,160
Do you see that I'm just
asking the same question

471
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,000
in different words?

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Solving A x -- A x --
that's very important.

473
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
A times x -- when I multiply
a matrix by a vector,

474
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I get a combination
of the columns.

475
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll write that
down in a moment.

476
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But in my column picture,
that's really what I'm doing.

477
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,432
I'm taking linear combinations
of these three columns

478
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:57,000
and I'm trying to find b.

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And, actually, the answer
for this matrix will be yes.

480
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For this matrix A -- for these
columns, the answer is yes.

481
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
This matrix -- that I chose for
an example is a good matrix.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
A non-singular matrix.

483
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
An invertible matrix.

484
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Those will be the matrices
that we like best.

485
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
There could be other -- and we
will see other matrices where

486
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
the answer becomes,
no -- oh, actually,

487
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,417
you can see when
it would become no.

488
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,000
What could go wrong? find out
-- because if elimination fails,

489
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,280
How could it go wrong
that out of these --

490
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,080
out of three columns and
all their combinations --

491
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,000
when would I not be able
to produce some b off here?

492
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When could it go wrong?

493
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,541
Do you see that
the combinations --

494
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:05,000
let me say when it goes wrong.

495
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If these three columns
all lie in the same plane,

496
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
then their combinations
will lie in that same plane.

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,760
So then we're in trouble.

498
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,920
If the three columns
of my matrix --

499
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,800
if those three vectors happen
to lie in the same plane --

500
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,840
for example, if column three
is just the sum of column one

501
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,000
and column two, I
would be in trouble.

502
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That would be a matrix A
where the answer would be no,

503
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
because the combinations --
if column three is in the same

504
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
plane as column one and two,
I don't get anything new from

505
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
that.

506
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right hand sides

507
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
b that I could get would
be the ones in that plane.

508
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,333
So I could solve it for
some right hand sides, when

509
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:08,663
b is in the plane, but
most right hand sides

510
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:11,000
would be out of the
plane and unreachable.

511
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So that would be
a singular case.

512
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
The matrix would
be not invertible.

513
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,070
There would not be a
solution for every b.

514
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,000
The answer would
become no for that.

515
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay.

516
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't know -- shall we take
just a little shot at thinking

517
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
about nine dimensions?

518
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Imagine that we have vectors
with nine components.

519
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well, it's going to be
hard to visualize those.

520
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't pretend to do it.

521
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But somehow, pretend you do.

522
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Pretend we have -- if this
was nine equations and nine

523
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
unknowns, then we would
have nine columns,

524
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,224
and each one would be a vector
in nine dimensional space

525
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:09,000
and we would be looking at
their linear combinations.

526
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,200
So we would be having
the linear combinations

527
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,360
of nine vectors in
nine dimensional space,

528
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,815
and we would be trying to
find the combination that hit

529
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:20,000
the correct right hand side b.

530
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And we might also ask the
question can we always do it?

531
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Can we get every
right hand side b?

532
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And certainly it will depend
on those nine columns.

533
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,333
Sometimes the answer will be yes
-- if I picked a random matrix,

534
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,000
it would be yes, actually.

535
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,333
If I used MatLab and just used
the random command, picked

536
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:43,901
out a nine by nine matrix,
I guarantee it would be

537
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:44,400
good.

538
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,200
It would be non
singular, it would

539
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,280
be invertible, all beautiful.

540
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:57,000
But if I choose those columns
so that they're not independent,

541
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,970
so that the ninth column is
the same as the eighth column,

542
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:12,000
then it contributes nothing new
and there would be right hand

543
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
sides b that I couldn't get.

544
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,632
Can you sort of think
about nine vectors

545
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:23,000
in nine dimensional space
an take their combinations?

546
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,724
That's really the
central thought --

547
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:30,000
that you get kind of used
to in linear algebra.

548
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,270
Even though you can't
really visualize it,

549
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,000
you sort of think you
can after a while.

550
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,500
Those nine columns and
all their combinations

551
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,000
may very well fill out the
whole nine dimensional space.

552
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,545
But if the ninth column happened
to be the same as the eighth

553
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:56,000
column and gave nothing new,
then probably what it would

554
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
fill out would be -- I
hesitate even to say this --

555
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
it would be a sort of a plane
-- an eight dimensional plane

556
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
inside nine-dimensional space.

557
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,426
And it's those eight
dimensional planes

558
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:14,500
inside nine dimensional
space that we

559
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,000
have to work with eventually.

560
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
For now, let's stay with a nice
case where the matrices work,

561
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,664
we can get every
right hand side b

562
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:29,000
and here we see how
to do it with columns.

563
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,040
Okay.

564
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,100
There was one step
which I realized

565
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:41,000
I was saying in words that I
now want to write in letters.

566
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Because I'm coming back to the
matrix form of the equation,

567
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
so let me write it here.

568
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,149
The matrix form of my
equation, of my system

569
00:35:56,149 --> 00:36:01,200
is some matrix A times some
vector x equals some right hand

570
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
side b.

571
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Okay.

572
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So this is a multiplication.

573
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
A times x.

574
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,267
Matrix times vector,
and I just want to say

575
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:13,000
how do you multiply
a matrix by a vector?

576
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Okay, so I'm just going
to create a matrix --

577
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,496
let me take two
five one three --

578
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:26,000
and let me take a vector
x to be, say, 1and 2.

579
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?

580
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,500
But just think a little
bit about matrix notation

581
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,000
and how to do that
in multiplication.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So let me say how I multiply
a matrix by a vector.

583
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Actually, there are
two ways to do it.

584
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Let me tell you my favorite way.

585
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's columns again.

586
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's a column at a time.

587
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,220
For me, this matrix
multiplication

588
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:04,000
says I take one of that column
and two of that column and add.

589
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,330
So this is the way
I would think of it

590
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,331
is one of the first column
and two of the second column

591
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:14,000
and let's just see what we get.

592
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So in the first component
I'm getting a two and a ten.

593
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm getting a twelve there.

594
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
In the second component I'm
getting a one and a six,

595
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm getting a seven.

596
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So that matrix times that
vector is twelve seven.

597
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Now, you could do
that another way.

598
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You could do it a row at a time.

599
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,500
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did

600
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,000
it here -- this way.

601
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Two -- I could take that
row times my vector.

602
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
This is the idea
of a dot product.

603
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,910
This vector times this vector,
two times one plus five times

604
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,000
two is the twelve.

605
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,400
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times

606
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,000
two is the seven.

607
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,800
So I can do it by rows,
and in each row times

608
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,000
my x is what I'll later
call a dot product.

609
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But I also like to
see it by columns.

610
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I see this as a linear
combination of a column.

611
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So here's my point.

612
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
A times x is a combination
of the columns of A.

613
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,000
That's how I hope you will
think of A times x when we need

614
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,500
it.

615
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Right now we've got
-- with small ones,

616
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,330
we can always do it in
different ways, but later,

617
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,000
think of it that way.

618
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,727
Okay.

619
00:38:53,727 --> 00:39:01,000
So that's the picture
for a two by two system.

620
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And if the right hand side B
happened to be twelve seven,

621
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
then of course the correct
solution would be one two.

622
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay.

623
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,000
So let me come back next
time to a systematic way,

624
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,500
using elimination,
to find the solution,

625
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,750
if there is one, to a
system of any size and
