1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is the lecture on the
singular value decomposition.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But everybody calls it the SVD.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this is the final and best
factorization of a matrix.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let me tell you what's coming.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The factors will be,
orthogonal matrix,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
diagonal matrix,
orthogonal matrix.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So it's things that we've seen
before, these special good

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
matrices, orthogonal diagonal.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The new point is that we need
two orthogonal matrices.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A can be any matrix whatsoever.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Any matrix whatsoever has this
singular value decomposition,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,480
so a diagonal one in the
middle, but I need two different

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,000
-- probably different orthogonal
matrices to be able to do this.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.
And this factorization has
jumped into importance and is

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,100
properly, I think,
maybe the bringing together of

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,650
everything in this course.

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,000
One thing we'll bring together
is the very good family of

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
matrices that we just studied,
symmetric, positive,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
definite.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you remember the stories
with those guys?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because they were symmetric,
their eigenvectors were

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,370
orthogonal, so I could produce
an orthogonal matrix -- this is

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,000
my usual one.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My usual one is the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the symmetric case,
the eigenvectors are

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
orthogonal, so I've got the good
-- my ordinary s has become an

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
especially good Q.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And positive definite,
my ordinary lambda has become a

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
positive lambda.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,960
So that's the singular value
decomposition in case our matrix

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,000
is symmetric positive definite
-- in that case,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't need two -- U and a V
-- one orthogonal matrix will do

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
for both sides.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So this would be no good in
general, because usually the

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
eigenvector matrix isn't
orthogonal.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,660
So that's not what I'm after.

38
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm looking for orthogonal
times diagonal times orthogonal.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And let me show you what that
means and where it comes from.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What does it mean?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You remember the picture of any
linear transformation.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This was, like,
the most important figure in

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000


45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And what I looking for now?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,890
A typical vector in the row
space

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
-- typical vector,
let me call it v1,

48
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:34,000
gets taken over to some vector
in the column space,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
say u1.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So u1 is Av1.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now, another vector gets taken
over here somewhere.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What I looking for?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In this SVD,
this singular value

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,660
decomposition,
what I'm looking for is an

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,000
orthogonal basis here that gets
knocked over into an orthogonal

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
basis over there.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
See that's pretty special,
to have an orthogonal basis in

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,350
the row space that goes over
into an orthogonal basis --

60
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,000
so this is like a right angle
and this is a right angle --

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
into an orthogonal basis in the
column space.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that's our goal,
is to find -- do you see how

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
things are coming together?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
First of all,
can I find an orthogonal basis

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,750
for this row space?

66
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,000
Of course.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No big deal to find an
orthogonal basis.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Graham Schmidt tells me how to
do it.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Start with any old basis and
grind through Graham Schmidt,

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
out comes an orthogonal basis.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,610
But then, if I just take any
old orthogonal basis,

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,000
then when I multiply by A,
there's no reason why it should

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
be orthogonal over here.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I'm looking for this special
set up where A takes these basis

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
vectors into orthogonal vectors
over there.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now, you might have noticed
that the null space I didn't

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
include.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why don't I stick that in?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You remember our usual figure
had a little null space and a

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
little null space.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And those are no problems.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Those null spaces are going to
show up as zeroes on the

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
diagonal of sigma,
so that doesn't present any

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
difficulty.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Our difficulty is to find
these.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,640
So do you see what this will
mean?

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,000
This will mean that A times
these v-s, v1,

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
v2, up to -- what's the
dimension of this row space?

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Vr.
Sorry, make that V a little
smaller -- up to vr.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So that's -- Av1 is going to be
the first column,

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so here's what I'm achieving.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, I'm not only going to make
these orthogonal,

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,410
but why not make them
orthonormal?

94
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,000
Make them unit vectors.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So maybe the unit vector is
here, is the u1,

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and this might be a multiple of
it.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So really, what's happening is
Av1 is some multiple of u1,

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
right?
These guys will be unit vectors
and they'll go over into

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
multiples of unit vectors and
the multiple I'm not going to

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
call lambda anymore.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm calling it sigma.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So that's the number -- the
stretching number.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And similarly,
Av2 is sigma two u2.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is my goal.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And now I want to express that
goal in matrix language.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's the usual step.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Think of what you want and then
express it as a matrix

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
multiplication.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So Av1 is sigma one u1 --
actually, here we go.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let me pull out these -- u1,
u2 to ur and then a matrix with

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,970
the sigmas.

112
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:39,000
Everything now is going to be
in that little part of the

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
blackboard.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,020
Do you see that this equation
says what I'm trying to do with

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,000
my figure.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
A times the first basis vector
should be sigma one times the

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
other basis -- the other first
basis vector.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
These are the basis vectors in
the row space,

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
these are the basis vectors in
the column space and these are

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the multiplying factors.

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So Av2 is sigma two times u2,
Avr is sigma r times ur.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then we've got a whole lot
of zeroes and maybe some zeroes

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
at the end, but that's the heart
of it.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And now if I express that in --
as matrices, because you knew

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that was coming -- that's what I
have.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, this is my goal,
to find an orthogonal basis in

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the orthonormal,
even -- basis in the row space

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and an orthonormal basis in the
column space so that I've sort

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of diagonalized the matrix.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The matrix A is,
like, getting converted to this

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
diagonal matrix sigma.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And you notice that usually I
have to allow myself two

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
different bases.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My little comment about
symmetric positive definite was

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the one case where it's A Q
equal Q sigma,

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
where V and U are the same Q.

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But mostly, you know,
I'm going to take a matrix like

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
-- oh, let me take a matrix like
four four minus three three.

139
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,360
There's a two by two matrix.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,000
It's invertible,
so it has rank two.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So I'm going to look for two
vectors, v1 and v2 in the row

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
space, and U -- so I'm going to
look for v1, v2 in the row

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
space, which of course is R^2.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I'm going to look for u1,
u2 in the column space,

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which of course is also R^2,
and I'm going to look for

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
numbers sigma one and sigma two
so that it all comes out right.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So these guys are orthonormal,
these guys are orthonormal and

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
these are the scaling factors.

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I'll do that example as soon
as I get the matrix picture

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
straight.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you see that this expresses
what I want?

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Can I just say two words about
null spaces?

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If there's some null space,
then we want to stick in a

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
basis for those,
for that.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So here comes a basis for the
null space, v(r+1) down to vm.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So if we only had an r
dimensional row space and the

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
other n-r dimensions were in the
null space --

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
okay, we'll take an orthogonal
-- orthonormal basis there.

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No problem.
And then we'll just get zeroes.

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, actually,
w- those zeroes will come out

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
on the diagonal matrix.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I'll complete that to an
orthonormal basis for the whole

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
space, R^m.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I complete this to an
orthonormal basis for the whole

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
space R^n and I complete that
with zeroes.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Null spaces are no problem
here.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,660
So really the true problem is
in a matrix like that,

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,980
which isn't symmetric,
so I can't use its

171
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,000
eigenvectors,
they're not orthogonal -- but

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
somehow I have to get these
orthogonal --

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in fact, orthonormal guys that
make it work.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have to find these
orthonormal guys,

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
these orthonormal guys and I
want Av1 to be sigma one u1 and

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Av2 to be sigma two u2.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.
That's my goal.

178
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,000
Here's the matrices that are
going to get me there.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,170
Now these are orthogonal
matrices.

180
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,000
I can put that -- if I multiply
on both sides by V inverse,

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I have A equals U sigma V
inverse, and of course you know

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the other way I can write V
inverse.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is one of those square
orthogonal matrices,

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so it's the same as U sigma V
transpose.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Here's my problem.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've got two orthogonal
matrices here.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I don't want to find them
both at once.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I want to cook up some
expression that will make the Us

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
disappear.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I would like to make the Us
disappear and leave me only with

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the Vs.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And here's how to do it.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's the same combination that
keeps showing up whenever we

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
have a general rectangular
matrix, then it's A transpose A,

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that's the great matrix.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's the great matrix.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's the matrix that's
symmetric, and in fact positive

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,920
definite or at least positive
semi-definite.

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,000
This is the matrix with nice
properties, so let's see what

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
will it be?
So if I took the transpose,
then, I would have -- A

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,280
transpose A will be what?

203
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,000
What do I have?

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If I transpose that I have V
sigma transpose U transpose,

205
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that's the A transpose.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,050
Now the A -- and what have I
got?

207
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,000
Looks like worse,
because it's got six things now

208
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,590
together, but it's going to
collapse into something good.

209
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,000
What does U transpose U
collapse into?

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I, the identity.

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So that's the key point.

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is the identity and we
don't have U anymore.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And sigma transpose times
sigma, those are diagonal

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
matrixes, so their product is
just going to have sigma

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
squareds on the diagonal.

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So do you see what we've got
here?

217
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is V times this easy
matrix sigma one squared sigma

218
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
two squared times V transpose.

219
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the A transpose A.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is -- let me copy down --
A transpose A is that.

221
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Us are out of the picture,
now.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm only having to choose the
Vs, and what are these Vs?

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And what are these sigmas?

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Do you know what the Vs are?

225
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
They're the eigenvectors that
-- see, this is a perfect

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,320
eigenvector, eigenvalue,
Q lambda Q transpose for the

227
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,000
matrix A transpose A.

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A itself is nothing special.

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But A transpose A will be
special.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It'll be symmetric positive
definite, so this will be its

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
eigenvectors and this'll be its
eigenvalues.

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And the eigenvalues'll be
positive because this thing's

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
positive definite.

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So this is my method.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This tells me what the Vs are.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And how I going to find the Us?

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, one way would be to look
at A A transpose.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Multiply A by A transpose in
the opposite order.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,480
That will stick the Vs in the
middle, knock them out,

240
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
and leave me with the Us.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So here's the overall picture,
then.

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The Vs are the eigenvectors of
A transpose A.

243
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The Us are the eigenvectors of
A A transpose,

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
which are different.

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,090
And the sigmas are the square
roots of these and the positive

246
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,000
square roots,
so we have positive sigmas.

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let me do it for that example.

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is really what you should
know and be able to do for the

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,570
SVD.

250
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,110
Okay.

251
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,000
Let me take that matrix.

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So what's my first step?

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Compute A transpose A,
because I want its

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
eigenvectors.

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay.
So I have to compute A
transpose A.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So A transpose is four four
minus three three,

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and A is four four minus three
three, and I do that

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
multiplication and I get sixteen
-- I get twenty five -- I get

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
sixteen minus nine -- is that
seven?

260
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And it better come out
symmetric.

261
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And -- oh, okay,
and then it comes out 25.

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.
So, I want its eigenvectors and
its eigenvalues.

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Its eigenvectors will be the
Vs, its eigenvalues will be the

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
squares of the sigmas.

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.
What are the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of this guy?

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Have you seen that two by two
example enough to recognize that

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the eigenvectors are -- that one
one is an eigenvector?

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So this here is A transpose A.

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm looking for its
eigenvectors.

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So its eigenvectors,
I think, are one one and one

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
minus one, because if I multiply
that matrix by one one,

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
what do I get?

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If I multiply that matrix by
one one, I get 32 32,

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which is 32 of one one.

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So there's the first
eigenvector, and there's the

276
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
eigenvalue for A transpose A.

277
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I'm going to take its square
root for sigma.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay.

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What's the eigenvector that
goes -- eigenvalue that goes

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
with this one?

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If I do that multiplication,
what do I get?

282
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I get some multiple of one
minus one, and what is that

283
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
multiple?

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Looks like 18.

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Okay.

286
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So those are the two
eigenvectors,

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
but -- oh, just a moment,
I didn't normalize them.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
To make everything absolutely
right, I ought to normalize

289
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
these eigenvectors,
divide by their length,

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
square root of two.

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So all these guys should be
true unit vectors and,

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
of course, that normalization
didn't change the 32 and the 18.

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay.

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So I'm happy with the Vs.

295
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Here are the Vs.

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So now let me put together the
pieces here.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Here's my A.

298
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Here's my A.

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let me write down A again.

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If life is right,
we should get U,

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
which I don't yet know -- U I
don't yet know,

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
sigma I do now know.

303
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's sigma?

304
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,350
So I'm looking for a U sigma V
transpose.

305
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,000
U, the diagonal guy and V
transpose.

306
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay.

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's just see that come out
right.

308
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So what are the sigmas?

309
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They're the square roots of
these things.

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So square root of 32 and square
root of 18.

311
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Zero zero.

312
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay.

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What are the Vs?

314
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They're these two.

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,120
And I have to transpose --
maybe that just leaves me with

316
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,000
ones --
with one over square root of

317
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
two in that row and the other
one is one over square root of

318
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
two minus one over square root
of two.

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Now finally,
I've got to know the Us.

320
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, actually,
one way to do -- since I now

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
know all the other pieces,
I could put those together and

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
figure out what the Us are.

323
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But let me do it the A A
transpose way.

324
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.
Find the Us now.
u1 and u2.

325
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,000
And what are they?

326
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I look at A A transpose -- so A
is supposed to be U sigma V

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
transpose, and then when I
transpose that I get V sigma

328
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
transpose U transpose.

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I'm just doing it in the
opposite order,

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
A times A transpose,
and what's the good part here?

331
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That in the middle,
V transpose V is going to be

332
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the identity.

333
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So this is just U sigma sigma
transpose, that's some diagonal

334
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
matrix with sigma squareds and U
transpose.

335
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So what I seeing here?

336
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,010
I'm seeing here,
again, a symmetric positive

337
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,000
definite or at least
semi-definite matrix and I'm

338
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
seeing its eigenvectors and its
eigenvalues.

339
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So if I compute A A transpose,
its eigenvectors will be the

340
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
things that go into U.

341
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay, so I need to compute A A
transpose.

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I guess I'm going to have to go
-- can I move that up just a

343
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
little?

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Maybe a little more and do A A
transpose.

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So what's A?

346
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Four four minus three and
three.

347
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And what's A transpose?

348
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Four four minus three and
three.

349
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And when I do that
multiplication,

350
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
what do I get?

351
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,610
Sixteen and sixteen,
thirty two.

352
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,000
Uh, that one comes out zero.

353
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, so this is a lucky case and
that one comes out 18.

354
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So this is an accident that A A
transpose happens to come out

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
diagonal, so we know easily its
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So its eigenvectors -- what's
the first eigenvector for this A

357
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
A transpose matrix?

358
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's just one zero,
and when I do that

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
multiplication,
I get 32 times one zero.

360
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And the other eigenvector is
just zero one and when I

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
multiply by that I get 18.

362
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So this is A A transpose.

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Multiplying that gives me the
32 A A transpose.

364
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Multiplying this guy gives me

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000


366
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,200
First of all,
I got 32 and 18 again.

367
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Am I surprised?

368
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,300
You know, it's clearly not an
accident.

369
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,000
The eigenvalues of A A
transpose were exactly the same

370
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
as the eigenvalues of -- this
one was A transpose A.

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's no surprise at all.

372
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The eigenvalues of A B are the
same as the eigenvalues of B A.

373
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,000
That's a very nice fact,
that eigenvalues stay the same

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
if I switch the order of
multiplication.

375
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So no surprise to see 32 and

376
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000


377
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
What I learned -- first the
check that things were

378
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
numerically correct,
but now I've learned these

379
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
eigenvectors,
and actually they're about as

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,770
nice as can be.

381
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,000
They're the best orthogonal
matrix, just the identity.

382
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay.

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So my claim is that it ought to
all fit together,

384
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
that these numbers should come
out right.

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The numbers should come out
right because the matrix

386
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
multiplications use the
properties that we want.

387
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay.
Shall we just check that?

388
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
Here's the identity,
so not doing anything -- square

389
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,850
root of 32 is multiplying that
row, so that square root of 32

390
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,000
divided by square root of two
means square root of 16,

391
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
four, correct?

392
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And square root of 18 is
divided by square root of two,

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
so that leaves me square root
of 9, which is three,

394
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but --
well, Professor Strang,

395
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you see the problem?

396
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,660
Why is that -- okay.

397
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:23,000
Why I getting minus three three
here and here I'm getting three

398
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
minus three?

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Phooey.

400
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know why.

401
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It shouldn't have happened,
but it did.

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Now, okay, you could say,
well, just -- the eigenvector

403
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
there could have -- I could have
had the minus sign here for that

404
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
eigenvector, but I'm not happy
about that.

405
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Hmm.

406
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Okay.
So I realize there's a little
catch here somewhere and I may

407
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
not see it until Wednesday.

408
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Which then gives you a very
important reason to come back on

409
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Wednesday, to catch that sine
difference.

410
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So what did I do illegally?

411
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think I put the eigenvectors
in that matrix V transpose --

412
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
okay, I'm going to have to
think.

413
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Why did that come out with with
the opposite sines?

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So you see -- I mean,
if I had a minus there,

415
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I would be all right,
but I don't want that.

416
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I want positive entries down
the diagonal of sigma squared.

417
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay.

418
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It'll come to me,
but, I'm going to leave this

419
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
example to finish.

420
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

421
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And the beauty of,
these sliding boards is I can

422
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
make that go away.

423
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Can I,-- let me not do it,
though, yet.

424
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Let me take a second example.

425
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let me take a second example
where the matrix is singular.

426
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So rank one.

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay, so let me take as an
example two, where my matrix A

428
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
is going to be rectangular again
-- let me just make it four

429
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
three eight six.

430
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay.

431
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's a rank one matrix.

432
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So that has a null space and
only a one dimensional row space

433
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and column space.

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So actually,
my picture becomes easy for

435
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this matrix, because what's my
row space for this one?

436
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So this is two by two.

437
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So my pictures are both two
dimensional.

438
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
My row space is all multiples
of that vector four three.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So the whole -- the row space
is just a line,

440
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
right?

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's the row space.

442
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And the null space,
of course, is the perpendicular

443
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
line.

444
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So the row space for this
matrix is multiples of four

445
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
three.

446
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Typical row.

447
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,970
Okay.

448
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,000
What's the column space?

449
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,980
The columns are all multiples
of four eight,

450
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,000
three six, one two.

451
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The column space,
then, goes in,

452
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
like, this direction.

453
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So the column space -- when I
look at those columns,

454
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,060
the column space -- so it's
only one dimensional,

455
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,670
because the rank is one.

456
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,000
It's multiples of four eight.

457
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Okay.

458
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And what's the null space of A
transpose?

459
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's the perpendicular guy.

460
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So this was the null space of A
and this is the null space of A

461
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
transpose.

462
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay.

463
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
What I want to say here is that
choosing these orthogonal bases

464
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
for the row space and the column
space is, like,

465
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
no problem.

466
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They're only one dimensional.

467
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So what should V be?

468
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,840
V should be -- v1,
but -- yes, v1,

469
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,000
rather -- v1 is supposed to be
a unit vector.

470
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There's only one v1 to choose
here, only one dimension in the

471
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
row space.

472
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I just want to make it a unit
vector.

473
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So v1 will be -- it'll be this
vector, but made into a unit

474
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
vector, so four -- point eight
point six.

475
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Four fifths,
three fifths.

476
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,460
And what will be u1?
u1 will be the unit vector

477
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,000
there.

478
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,950
So I want to turn four eight or
one two into a unit vector,

479
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,000
so u1 will be -- let's see,
if it's one two,

480
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
then what multiple of one two
do I want?

481
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That has length square root of
five, so I have to divide by

482
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
square root of five.

483
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let me complete the singular
value decomposition for this

484
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
matrix.

485
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So this matrix,
four three eight six,

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:15,000
is -- so I know what u1 --
here's A and I want to get U the

487
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
basis in the column space.

488
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And it has to start with this
guy, one over square root of

489
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
five two over square root of
five.

490
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Then I want the sigma.

491
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.
What are we expecting now for
sigma?

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This is only a rank one matrix.

493
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We're only expecting a sigma
one, which I have to find,

494
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
but zeroes here.

495
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay.

496
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So what's sigma one?

497
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It should be the -- where did
these sigmas come from?

498
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,220
They came from A transpose A,
so I -- can I do that little

499
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,000
calculation over here?

500
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
A transpose A is four three --
four three eight six times four

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
three eight six.

502
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This had better -- this is a
rank one matrix,

503
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
this is going to be --
the whole thing will have rank

504
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
one, that's 16 and 64 is 80,
12 and 48 is 60,

505
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
12 and 48 is 60,
9 and 36 is 45.

506
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Okay.

507
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's a rank one matrix.

508
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Of course.

509
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Every row is a multiple of four
three.

510
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And what's the eigen -- what
are the eigenvalues of that

511
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
matrix?

512
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So this is the calculation --
this is like practicing,

513
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,000
now.
What are the eigenvalues of
this rank one matrix?

514
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well, tell me one eigenvalue,
since the rank is only one,

515
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
one eigenvalue is going to be
zero.

516
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,179
And then you know that the
other eigenvalue is going to be

517
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,000
a hundred and twenty five.

518
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So that's sigma squared,
right, in A transpose A.

519
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So this will be the square root
of a hundred and twenty five.

520
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And then finally,
the V transpose -- the Vs will

521
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
be -- there's v1,
and what's v2?

522
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,090
What's v2 in the -- how do I
make this into an orthonormal

523
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,000
basis?

524
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Well, v2 is,
in the null space direction.

525
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's perpendicular to that,
so point six and minus point

526
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,000
eight.
So those are the Vs that go in
here.

527
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,990
Point eight,
point six and point six minus

528
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,000
point eight.

529
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Okay.
And I guess I better finish
this guy.

530
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So this guy,
all I want is to complete the

531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
orthonormal basis --
it'll be coming from there.

532
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It'll be a two over square root
of five and a minus one over

533
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
square root of five.

534
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let me take square root of five
out of that matrix to make it

535
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
look better.

536
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So one over square root of five
times one two two minus one.

537
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay.

538
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So there I have -- including
the square root of five --

539
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
that's an orthogonal matrix,
that's an orthogonal matrix,

540
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that's a diagonal matrix and
its rank is only one.

541
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And now if I do that
multiplication,

542
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I pray that it comes out right.

543
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
The square root of five will
cancel into that square root of

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
one twenty five and leave me
with the square root of 25,

545
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
which is five,
and five will multiply these

546
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
numbers and I'll get whole
numbers and out will come A.

547
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Okay.

548
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That's like a second example
showing how the null space guy

549
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
-- so this -- this vector and
this one were multiplied by this

550
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
zero.

551
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So they were easy to deal with.

552
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Tthe key ones are the ones in
the column space and the row

553
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
space.

554
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Do you see how I'm getting
columns here,

555
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
diagonal here,
rows here, coming together to

556
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
produce A.

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Okay, that's the singular value
decomposition.

558
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So, let me think what I want to
add to complete this topic.

559
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So that's two examples.

560
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,130
And now let's think what we're
really doing.

561
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:41,000
We're choosing the right basis
for the four subspaces of linear

562
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
algebra.

563
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Let me write this down.

564
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So v1 up to vr is an
orthonormal basis for the row

565
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
space.
u1 up to ur is an orthonormal

566
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
basis for the column space.

567
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then I just finish those
out by v(r+1),

568
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the rest up to vn is an
orthonormal basis for the null

569
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
space.

570
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And finally,
u(r+1) up to is an orthonormal

571
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
basis for the null space of A
transpose.

572
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Do you see that we finally got
the bases right?

573
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
They're right because they're
orthonormal, and also -- again,

574
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Graham Schmidt would have done
this in chapter four.

575
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Here we needed eigenvalues,
because these bases make the

576
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
matrix diagonal.

577
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
A times V I is a multiple of U
I.

578
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So I'll put "and" -- the matrix
has been made diagonal.

579
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
When we choose these bases,
there's no coupling between Vs

580
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,800
and no coupling between Us.

581
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,000
Each A -- A times each V is in
the direction of the

582
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
corresponding U.

583
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,760
So it's exactly the right basis
for the four fundamental

584
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,000
subspaces.

585
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,470
And of course,
their dimensions are what we

586
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,010
know.

587
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,650
The dimension of the row space
is the rank r,

588
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,000
and so is the dimension of the
column space.

589
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The dimension of the null space
is n-r, that's how many vectors

590
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
we need, and m-r basis vectors
for the left null space,

591
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
the null space of A transpose.

592
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Okay.
I'm going to stop there.

593
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,390
I could develop further from
the SVD, but we'll see it again

594
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,000
in the very last lectures of the
course.

595
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So there's the SVD.

596
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Thanks.
