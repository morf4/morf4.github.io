1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, OK, four,
three, two, one,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OK, I see you guys are in a
happy mood.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know if that means
18.06 is ending,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
or, the quiz was good.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Uh, my birthday conference was
going on at the time of the

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
quiz, and in the conference,
of course, everybody had to say

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
nice things, but I was
wondering, what would my 18.06

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
class be saying,
because it was at the exactly

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the same time.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But, what I know from the
grades so far,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
they're basically close to,
and maybe slightly above the

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
grades that you got on quiz two.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, very satisfactory.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And, then we have a final exam
coming up, and today's lecture,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,820
as I told you by email,
will be a first step in the

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,610
review, and then on Wednesday
I'll do all I can in reviewing

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,000
the whole course.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So my topic today is --
actually, this is a lecture I

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
have never given before in this
way, and it will -- well,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
four subspaces,
that's certainly fundamental,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,860
and you know that,
so I want to speak about

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,000
left-inverses and right-inverses
and then something called

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
pseudo-inverses.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And pseudo-inverses,
let me say right away,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that comes in near the end of
chapter seven,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and that would not be expected
on the final.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But you'll see that what I'm
talking about is really the

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
basic stuff that,
for an m-by-n matrix of rank r,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
we're going back to the most
fundamental picture in linear

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
algebra.
Nobody could forget that
picture, right?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,919
When you're my age,
even, you'll remember the row

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
space, and the null space.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Orthogonal complements over
there, the column space and the

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
null space of A transpose
column, orthogonal complements

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
over here.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,900
And I want to speak about
inverses.

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,000
OK.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I want to identify the
different possibilities.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So first of all,
when does a matrix have a just

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
a perfect inverse,
two-sided, you know,

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
so the two-sided inverse is
what we just call inverse,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
right?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And, so that means that there's
a matrix that produces the

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
identity, whether we write it on
the left or on the right.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And just tell me,
how are the numbers r,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,610
the rank, n the number of
columns, m the number of rows,

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,000
how are those numbers related
when we have an invertible

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
matrix?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So this is the matrix which was
-- chapter two was all about

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
matrices like this,
the beginning of the course,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
what was the relation of th- of
r, m, and n, for the nice case?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They're all the same,
all equal.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So this is the case when r=m=n.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,230
Square matrix,
full rank, period,

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:51,000
just -- so I'll use the words
full rank.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,040
OK, good.

57
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Everybody knows that.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
OK.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then chapter three.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We began to deal with matrices
that were not of full rank,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and they could have any rank,
and we learned what the rank

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
was.
And then we focused,
if you remember on some cases

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
like full column rank.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now, can you remember what was
the deal with full column rank?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, now, I think this is the
case in which we have a

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
left-inverse,
and I'll try to find it.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So we have a -- what was the
situation there?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the case of full column
rank, and that means -- what

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
does that mean about r?

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,760
It equals, what's the deal with
r, now, if we have full column

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,000
rank, I mean the columns are
independent, but maybe not the

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
rows.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So what is r equal to in this
case?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
n.
Thanks.
n.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
r=n.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,820
The n columns are independent,
but probably,

77
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,000
we have more rows.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's the picture,
and then what's the null space

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
for this?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So the n columns are
independent, what's the null

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
space in this case?

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So of course,
you know what I'm asking.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're saying,
why is this guy asking

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
something, I know that-- I think
about it in my sleep,

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
right?
So the null space of this
matrix if the rank is n,

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the null space is what vectors
are in the null space?

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Just the zero vector.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right?

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The columns are independent.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Independent columns.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No combination of the columns
gives zero except that one.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And what's my picture over,
-- let me redraw my picture --

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the row space is everything.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No.
Is that right?

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's see, I often get these
turned around,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
right?

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
So what's the deal?

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The columns are independent,
right?

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So the rank should be the full
number of columns,

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
so what does that tell us?

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's no null space,
right.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,180
OK.

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,000
The row space is the whole
thing.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, I won't even draw the
picture.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And what was the deal with --
and these were very important in

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
least squares problems because
-- So, what more is true here?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If we have full column rank,
the null space is zero,

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we have independent columns,
the unique -- so we have zero

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
or one solutions to Ax=b.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There may not be any solutions,
but if there's a solution,

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,390
there's only one solution
because other solutions are

112
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,840
found by adding on stuff from
the null space,

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,000
and there's nobody there to add
on.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So the particular solution is
the solution,

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
if there is a particular
solution.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But of course,
the rows might not be - are

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
probably not independent
-- and therefore,

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
so right-hand sides won't end
up with a zero equal zero after

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
elimination, so sometimes we may
have no solution,

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
or one solution.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
OK.
And what I want to say is that
for this matrix A -- oh,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
yes, tell me something about A
transpose A in this case.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So this whole part of the
board, now, is devoted to this

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
case.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What's the deal with A
transpose A?

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've emphasized over and over
how important that combination

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
is, for a rectangular matrix,
A transpose A is the good thing

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to look at, and if the rank is
n, if the null space has only

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
zero in it, then the same is
true of A transpose A.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,590
That's the beautiful fact,
that if the rank of A is n,

131
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:47,000
well, we know this will be an n
by n symmetric matrix,

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,320
and it will be full rank.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
So this is invertible.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This matrix is invertible.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That matrix is invertible.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And now I want to show you that
A itself has a one-sided

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
inverse.
Here it is.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,850
The inverse of that,
which exists,

139
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,000
times A transpose,
there is a one-sided -- shall I

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
call it A inverse?
-- left of the matrix A.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why do I say that?

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Because if I multiply this guy
by A, what do I get?

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What does that multiplication
give?

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Of course, you know it
instantly, because I just put

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,870
the parentheses there,
I have A transpose A inverse

146
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,000
times A transpose A so,
of course, it's the identity.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So it's a left inverse.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And this was the totally
crucial case for least squares,

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
because you remember that least
squares, the central equation of

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,200
least squares had this matrix,
A transpose A,

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
as its coefficient matrix.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,300
And in the case of full column
rank, that matrix is invertible,

153
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,000
and we're go.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,130
So that's the case where there
is a left-inverse.

155
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,100
So A does whatever it does,
we can find a matrix that

156
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,000
brings it back to the identity.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now, is it true that,
in the other order -- so A

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
inverse left times A is the
identity.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,470
Right?

160
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,000
This matrix is m by n.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,720
This matrix is n by m.

162
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,000
The identity matrix is n by n.

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All good.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
All good if you're n.

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But if you try to put that
matrix on the other side,

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it would fail.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,500
If the full column rank -- if
this is smaller than m,

168
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
the case where they're equals
is the beautiful case,

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but that's all set.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, we're looking at the case
where the columns are

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
independent but the rows are
not.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So this is invertible,
but what matrix is not

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
invertible?
A A transpose is bad for this
case.

174
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,000
A transpose A is good.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So we can multiply on the left,
everything good,

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
we get the left inverse.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But it would not be a two-sided
inverse.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
A rectangular matrix can't have
a two-sided inverse,

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
because there's got to be some
null space, right?

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If I have a matrix that's
rectangular, then either that

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
matrix or its transpose has some
null space, because if n and m

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
are different,
then there's going to be some

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
free variables around,
and we'll have some null space

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in that direction.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
OK, tell me the corresponding
picture for the opposite case.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,150
So now I'm going to ask you
about right-inverses.

187
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,000
A right-inverse.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And you can fill this all out,
this is going to be the case of

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
full row rank.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And then r is equal to m,
now, the m rows are

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
independent, but the columns are
not.

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So what's the deal on that?

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, just exactly the flip of
this one.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The null space of A transpose
contains only zero,

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
because there are no
combinations of the rows that

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
give the zero row.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,370
We have independent rows.

198
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,000
And in a minute,
I'll give an example of all

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
these.

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,250
So, how many solutions to Ax=b
in this case?

201
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,050
The rows are independent.

202
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,000
So we can always solve Ax=b.

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Whenever elimination never
produces a zero row,

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so we never get into that zero
equal one problem,

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
so Ax=b always has a solution,
but too many.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So there will be some null
space, the null space of A --

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,190
what will be the dimension of
A's null space?

208
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,000
How many free variables have we
got?

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How many special solutions in
that null space have we got?

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So how many free variables in
this setup?

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We've got n columns,
so n variables,

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and this tells us how many are
pivot variables,

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that tells us how many pivots
there are, so there are n-m free

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
variables.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So there are infinitely many
solutions to Ax=b.

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We have n-m free variables in
this case.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
OK.
Now I wanted to ask about this
idea of a right-inverse.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,100
OK.

219
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,000
So I'm going to have a matrix
A, my matrix A,

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and now there's going to be
some inverse on the right that

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,420
will give the identity matrix.

222
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,000
So it will be A times A inverse
on the right,

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
will be I.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And can you tell me what,
just by comparing with what we

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
had up there,
what will be the right-inverse,

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
we even have a formula for it.

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There will be other --
actually, there are other

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
left-inverses,
that's our favorite.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There will be other
right-inverses,

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but tell me our favorite here,
what's the nice right-inverse?

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The nice right-inverse will be,
well, there we had A transpose

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A was good, now it will be A A
transpose that's good.

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The good matrix,
the good right -- the thing we

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
can invert is A A transpose,
so now if I just do it that

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
way, there sits the
right-inverse.

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You see how completely parallel
it is to the one above?

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Right.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So that's the right-inverse.

239
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So that's the case when there
is -- In terms of this picture,

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
tell me what the null spaces
are like so far for these three

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,480
cases.

242
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
What about case one,
where we had a two-sided

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
inverse, full rank,
everything great.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The null spaces were,
like, gone, right?

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The null spaces were just the
zero vectors.

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then I took case two,
this null space was gone.

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Case three, this null space was
gone, and then case four is,

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like, the most general case
when this picture is all there

249
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
-- when all the null spaces --
this has dimension r,

250
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
of course, this has dimension
n-r, this has dimension r,

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this has dimension m-r,
and the final case will be when

252
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
r is smaller than m and n.

253
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But can I just,
before I leave here look a

254
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
little more at this one?

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
At this case of full column
rank?

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So A inverse on the left,
it has this left-inverse to

257
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
give the identity.

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I said if we multiply it in the
other order, we wouldn't get the

259
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
identity.

260
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But then I just realized that I
should ask you,

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
what do we get?

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So if I put them in the other
order -- if I continue this down

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
below, but I write A times A
inverse left -- so there's A

264
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,830
times the left-inverse,
but it's not on the left any

265
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,000
more.

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,380
So it's not going to come out
perfectly.

267
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:37,000
But everybody in this room
ought to recognize that matrix,

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
right?

269
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's see, is that the guy we
know?

270
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Am I OK, here?

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What is that matrix?

272
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
P.

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thanks.

274
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,000
P.
That matrix -- it's a
projection.

275
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's the projection onto the
column space.

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's trying to be the identity
matrix, right?

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A projection matrix tries to be
the identity matrix,

278
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but you've given it,
an impossible job.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So it's the identity matrix
where it can be,

280
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and elsewhere,
it's the zero matrix.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So this is P,
right.

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,390
A projection onto the column
space.

283
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,000
OK.

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And if I asked you this one,
and put these in the opposite

285
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
order -- so this came from up
here.

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And similarly,
if I try to put the right

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
inverse on the left -- so that,
like, came from above.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This, coming from this side,
what happens if I try to put

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the right inverse on the left?

290
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then I would have A transpose
A, A transpose inverse A,

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if this matrix is now on the
left, what do you figure that

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
matrix is?

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's going to be a projection,
too, right?

294
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,060
It looks very much like this
guy, except the only difference

295
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,000
is, A and A transpose have been
reversed.

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So this is a projection,
this is another projection,

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
onto the row space.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Again, it's trying to be the
identity, but there's only so

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
much the matrix can do.

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And this is the projection onto
the column space.

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So let me now go back to the
main picture and tell you about

302
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the general case,
the pseudo-inverse.

303
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
These are cases we know.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,180
So this was important review.

305
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,000
You've got to know the business
about these ranks,

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and the free variables --
really, this is linear algebra

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
coming together.

308
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And, you know,
one nice thing about teaching

309
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
18.06,

310
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not trivial.

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But it's -- I don't know,
somehow, it's nice when it

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
comes out right.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I mean -- well,
I shouldn't say anything bad

314
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
about calculus,
but I will.

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean, like,
you know, you have formulas for

316
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
surface area,
and other awful things and,

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,700
you know, they do their best in
calculus, but it's not elegant.

318
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:44,000
And, linear algebra just is --
well, you know,

319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
linear algebra is about the
nice part of calculus,

320
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
where everything's,
like, flat, and,

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,080
the formulas come out right.

322
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,000
And you can go into high
dimensions where,

323
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in calculus,
you're trying to visualize

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,480
these things,
well, two or three dimensions

325
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,590
is kind of the limit.

326
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,000
But here, we don't -- you know,
I've stopped doing two-by-twos,

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm just talking about the
general case.

328
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
OK, now I really will speak
about the general case here.

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What could be the inverse --
what's a kind of reasonable

330
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
inverse for a matrix for the
completely general matrix where

331
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
there's a rank r,
but it's smaller than n,

332
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
so there's some null space
left, and it's smaller than m,

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
so a transpose has some null
space, and it's those null

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
spaces that are screwing up
inverses, right?

335
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because if a matrix takes a
vector to zero,

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:59,000
well, there's no way an inverse
can, like, bring it back to

337
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
life.

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,490
My topic is now the
pseudo-inverse,

339
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,000
and let's just by a picture,
see what's the best inverse we

340
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
could have?

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,270
So, here's a vector x in the
row space.

342
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,000
I multiply by A.

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now, the one thing everybody
knows is you take a vector,

344
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
you multiply by A,
and you get an output,

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and where is that output?

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Where is Ax?

347
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Always in the column space,
right?

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Ax is a combination of the
columns.

349
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So Ax is somewhere here.

350
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So I could take all the vectors
in the row space.

351
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I could multiply them all by A.

352
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I would get a bunch of vectors
in the column space and what I

353
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,560
think is, I'd get all the
vectors in the column space just

354
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,000
right.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think that this connection
between an x in the row space

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and an Ax in the column space,
this is one-to-one.

357
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
We got a chance,
because they have the same

358
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,000
dimension.
That's an r-dimensional space,
and that's an r-dimensional

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
space.

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And somehow,
the matrix A -- it's got these

361
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,390
null spaces hanging around,
where it's knocking vectors to

362
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:27,000
zero.

363
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And then it's got all the
vectors in between,

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
which is almost all vectors.

365
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Almost all vectors have a row
space component and a null space

366
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,000
component.
And it's killing the null space
component.

367
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But if I look at the vectors
that are in the row space,

368
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
with no null space component,
just in the row space,

369
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
then they all go into the
column space,

370
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
so if I put another vector,
let's say, y,

371
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
in the row space,
I positive that wherever Ay is,

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it won't hit Ax.

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Do you see what I'm saying?

374
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's see why.

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
All right.

376
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So here's what I said.

377
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If x and y are in the row
space, then A x is not the same

378
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
as A y.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
They're both in the column
space, of course,

380
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
but they're different.

381
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That would be a perfect
question on a final exam,

382
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
because that's what I'm
teaching you in that material of

383
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
chapter three and chapter four,
especially chapter three.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If x and y are in the row
space, then Ax is different from

385
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Ay.

386
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So what this means -- and we'll
see why -- is that,

387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
in words, from the row space to
the column space,

388
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
A is perfect,
it's an invertible matrix.

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If we, like,
limited it to those spaces.

390
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And then, its inverse will be
what I'll call the

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
pseudo-inverse.

392
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So that's that the
pseudo-inverse is.

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's the inverse -- so A goes
this way, from x to y -- sorry,

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
x to A x, from y to A y,
that's A, going that way.

395
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Then in the other direction,
anything in the column space

396
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
comes from somebody in the row
space, and the reverse there is

397
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
what I'll call the
pseudo-inverse,

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and the accepted notation is A
plus.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So y will be A plus x.

400
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No, y will be A plus times
whatever it started with,

402
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
A y.

403
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Do you see my picture there?

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Same, of course,
for x and A x.

405
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This way, A does it,
the other way is the

406
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
pseudo-inverse,
and the pseudo-inverse just

407
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
kills this stuff,
and the matrix just kills this

408
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
stuff.
So everything that's really
serious here is going on in the

409
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
row space and the column space,
and now, tell me

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
-- this is the fundamental
fact, that between those two

411
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
r-dimensional spaces,
our matrix is perfect.

412
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Why?
Suppose they weren't.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,680
Why do I get into trouble?

414
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,000
Suppose -- so,
proof.

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I haven't written down proof
very much, but I'm going to use

416
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that word once.

417
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Suppose they were the same.

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Suppose these are supposed to
be two different vectors.

419
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Maybe I'd better make the
statement correctly.

420
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If x and y are different
vectors in the row space --

421
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
maybe I'll better put if x is
different from y,

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
both in the row space -- so I'm
starting with two different

423
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,950
vectors in the row space,
I'm multiplying by A -- so

424
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,000
these guys are in the column
space, everybody knows that,

425
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and the point is,
they're different over there.

426
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So, suppose they weren't.

427
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Suppose A x=A y.

428
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Suppose, well,
that's the same as saying

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
A(x-y) is zero.

430
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So what?

431
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So, what do I know now about
(x-y), what do I know about this

432
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
vector?

433
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Well, I can see right away,
what space is it in?

434
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's sitting in the null space,
right?

435
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So it's in the null space.

436
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But what else do I know about
it?

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Here it was x in the row space,
y in the row space,

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
what about x-y?

439
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's also in the row space,
right?

440
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Heck, that thing is a vector
space, and if the vector space

441
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
is anything at all,
if x is in the row space,

442
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and y is in the row space,
then the difference is also,

443
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so it's also in the row space.

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,070
So what?

445
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,660
Now I've got a vector x-y
that's in the null space,

446
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,400
and that's also in the row
space, so what vector is it?

447
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
It's the zero vector.

448
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So I would conclude from that
that x-y had to be the zero

449
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
vector, x-y, so,
in other words,

450
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
if I start from two different
vectors, I get two different

451
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
vectors.

452
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
If these vectors are the same,
then those vectors had to be

453
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the same.

454
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's like the algebra proof,
which we understand completely

455
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
because we really understand
these subspaces of what I said

456
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in words, that a matrix A is
really a nice,

457
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
invertible mapping from row
space to columns pace.

458
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If the null spaces keep out of
the way, then we have an

459
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
inverse.

460
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And that inverse is called the
pseudo inverse,

461
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,900
and it's a very,
very, useful in application.

462
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,000
Statisticians discovered,
oh boy, this is the thing that

463
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
we needed all our lives,
and here it finally showed up,

464
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,730
the pseudo-inverse is the right
thing.

465
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,000
Why do statisticians need it?

466
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And because statisticians are
like least-squares-happy.

467
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I mean they're always doing
least squares.

468
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And so this is their central
linear regression.

469
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Statisticians who may watch
this on video,

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,810
please forgive that description
of your interests.

471
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:29,000
One of your interests is linear
regression and this problem.

472
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But this problem is only OK
provided we have full column

473
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,000
rank.
And statisticians have to worry
all the time about,

474
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
oh, God, maybe we just repeated
an experiment.

475
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You know, you're taking all
these measurements,

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,540
maybe you just repeat them a
few times.

477
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,000
You know, maybe they're not
independent.

478
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, in that case,
that A transpose A matrix that

479
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
they depend on becomes singular.

480
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So then that's when they needed
the pseudo-inverse,

481
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,830
it just arrived at the right
moment, and it's the right

482
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,000
quantity.

483
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,000
OK.
So now that you know what the
pseudo-inverse should do,

484
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
let me see what it is.

485
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Can we find it?

486
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So this is my -- to complete
the lecture is -- how do I find

487
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
this pseudo-inverse A plus?

488
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
OK.

489
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000
OK.
Well, here's one way.

490
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Everything I do today is to try
to review stuff.

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,470
One way would be to start from
the SVD.

492
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,000
The Singular Value
Decomposition.

493
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And you remember that that
factored A into an orthogonal

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
matrix times this diagonal
matrix times this orthogonal

495
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
matrix.

496
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But what did that diagonal guy
look like?

497
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This diagonal guy,
sigma, has some non-zeroes,

498
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
and you remember,
they came from A transpose A,

499
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and A A transpose,
these are the good guys,

500
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,940
and then some more zeroes,
and all zeroes there,

501
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,000
and all zeroes there.

502
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So you can guess what the
pseudo-inverse is,

503
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,590
I just invert stuff that's nice
to invert -- well,

504
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,000
what's the pseudo-inverse of
this?

505
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's what the problem comes
down to.

506
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
What's the pseudo-inverse of
this beautiful diagonal matrix?

507
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But it's got a null space,
right?

508
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
What's the rank of this matrix?

509
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
What's the rank of this
diagonal matrix?

510
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
r, of course.

511
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's got r non-zeroes,
and then it's otherwise,

512
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
zip.
So it's got n columns,
it's got m rows,

513
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and it's got rank r.

514
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's the best example,
the simplest example we could

515
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
ever have of our general setup.

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,000
OK?
So what's the pseudo-inverse?

517
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What's the matrix -- so I'll
erase our columns,

518
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
because right below it,
I want to write the

519
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
pseudo-inverse.

520
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
OK, you can make a pretty darn
good guess.

521
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If it was a proper diagonal
matrix, invertible,

522
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
if there weren't any zeroes
down here, if it was sigma one

523
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
to sigma n, then everybody knows
what the inverse would be,

524
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the inverse would be one over
sigma one, down to one over s-

525
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but of course,
I'll have to stop at sigma r.

526
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And, it will be the rest,
zeroes again,

527
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
of course.

528
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And now this one was m by n,
and this one is meant to have a

529
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
slightly different,
you know, transpose shape,

530
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
n by m.

531
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
They both have that rank r.

532
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My idea is that the
pseudo-inverse is the best -- is

533
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the closest I can come to an
inverse.

534
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So what is sigma times its
pseudo-inverse?

535
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Can you multiply sigma by its
pseudo-inverse?

536
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Multiply that by that?

537
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
What matrix do you get?

538
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They're diagonal.

539
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Rectangular,
of course.

540
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But of course,
we're going to get ones,

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
R ones, and all the rest,
zeroes.

542
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And the shape of that,
this whole matrix will be m by

543
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,000
m.
And suppose I did it in the
other order.

544
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,000
Suppose I did sigma plus sigma.

545
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Why don't I do it right
underneath?

546
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,170
in the opposite order?

547
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,000
See, this matrix hasn't got a
left-inverse,

548
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
it hasn't got a right-inverse,
but every matrix has got a

549
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
pseudo-inverse.

550
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
If I do it in the order sigma
plus sigma, what do I get?

551
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,420
Square matrix,
this is m by n,

552
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,000
this is m by m,
my result is going to m by m --

553
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
is going to be n by n,
and what is it?

554
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Those are diagonal matrices,
it's going to be ones,

555
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,610
and then zeroes.

556
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,000
It's not the same as that,
it's a different size -- it's a

557
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,260
projection.

558
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,000
One is a projection matrix onto
the column space,

559
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and this one is the projection
matrix onto the row space.

560
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's the best that
pseudo-inverse can do.

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So what the pseudo-inverse does
is, if you multiply on the left,

562
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,890
you don't get the identity,
if you multiply on the right,

563
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,000
you don't get the identity,
what you get is the projection.

564
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It brings you into the two good
spaces, the row space and column

565
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
space.

566
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And it just wipes out the null
space.

567
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,640
So that's what the
pseudo-inverse of this diagonal

568
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,000
one is, and then the
pseudo-inverse of A itself --

569
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
this is perfectly invertible.

570
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What's the inverse of V
transpose?

571
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,410
Just another tiny bit of
review.

572
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:23,110
That's an orthogonal matrix,
and its inverse is V,

573
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,000
good.

574
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This guy has got all the
trouble in it,

575
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
all the null space is
responsible for,

576
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
so it doesn't have a true
inverse, it has a

577
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,150
pseudo-inverse,
and then the inverse of U is U

578
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,000
transpose, thanks.

579
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Or, of course,
I could write U inverse.

580
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So, that's the question of,
how do you find the

581
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
pseudo-inverse
-- so what statisticians do

582
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
when they're in this -- so this
is like the case of where least

583
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
squares breaks down because the
rank is -- you don't have full

584
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
rank, and the beauty of the
singular value decomposition is,

585
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
it puts all the problems into
this diagonal matrix where it's

586
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
clear what to do.

587
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's the best inverse you could
think of is clear.

588
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You see there could be other --
I mean, we could put some stuff

589
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
down here, it would multiply
these zeroes.

590
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It wouldn't have any effect,
but then the good

591
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
pseudo-inverse is the one with
no extra stuff,

592
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it's sort of,
like, as small as possible.

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It has to have those to produce
the ones.

594
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If it had other stuff,
it would just be a larger

595
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
matrix, so this pseudo-inverse
is kind of the minimal matrix

596
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,180
that gives the best result.

597
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,000
Sigma sigma plus being r ones.

598
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SK.
so I guess I'm hoping --

599
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
pseudo-inverse,
again, let me repeat what I

600
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
said at the very beginning.

601
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
This pseudo-inverse,
which appears at the end,

602
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:22,000
which is in section seven point
four, and probably I did more

603
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
with it here than I did in the
book.

604
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
The word pseudo-inverse will
not appear on an exam in this

605
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
course, but I think if you see
this all will appear,

606
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because this is all what the
course was about,

607
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
chapters one,
two, three, four -- but if you

608
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
see all that,
then you probably see,

609
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
well, OK, the general case had
both null spaces around,

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,300
and this is the natural thing
to do.

611
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes.

612
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So, this is one way to find the
pseudo-inverse.

613
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The point of a pseudo-inverse,
of computing a pseudo-inverse

614
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
is to get some factors where you
can find the pseudo-inverse

615
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
quickly.

616
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And this is,
like, the champion,

617
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
because this is where we can
invert those,

618
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and those two,
easily, just by transposing,

619
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and we know what to do with a
diagonal.

620
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
OK, that's as much review,
maybe --

621
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
let's have a five-minute
holiday in 18.06 and,

622
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'll see you Wednesday,
then, for the rest of this

623
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,000
course.
Thanks.
