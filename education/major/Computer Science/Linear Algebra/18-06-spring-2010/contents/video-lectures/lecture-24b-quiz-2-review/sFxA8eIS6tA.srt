1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
OK, this is quiz review day.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The quiz coming up on Wednesday
will before this lecture the

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
quiz will be this hour one
o'clock Wednesday in Walker,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
top floor of Walker,
closed book,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
all normal.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I wrote down what we've covered
in this second part of the

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
course, and actually I'm
impressed as I

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
write it.
so that's chapter four on

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
orthogonality and you're
remembering these -- what this

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is suggesting,
these are those columns are

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
orthonormal vectors,
and then we call that matrix Q

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the -- what's the key -- how
do we state the fact that those

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
v- those columns are orthonormal
in

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
terms of Q, it means that Q
transpose Q is the identity.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So that's the matrix statement
of the -- of the property that

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the columns are orthonormal,
the dot products are either one

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or zero, and then we computed
the projections onto lines and

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
onto
subspaces, and we used that to

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,000
solve problems Ax=b in -- in the
least square sense,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
when there was no solution,
we found the best solution.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And then finally this
Graham-Schmidt idea,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which takes independent vectors
and lines them up,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
takes -- subtracts off the
projections of the part you've

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
already done,
so that the new part is

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
orthogonal and so it takes a
basis to an orthonormal basis.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,640
And you -- those calculations
involve square roots a lot

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,000
because you're making things
unit vectors,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but you should know that step.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
OK,
for determinants,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the three big -- the big
picture is the properties of the

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
determinant, one to three d-
properties one,

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
two and three,
d- that define the determinant,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and then four,
five, six through ten were

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
consequences.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then the big formula that has n
factorial terms,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,340
half of them have plus signs
and half minus signs,

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,000
and then the cofactor formula.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,030
So and which led us to a
formula for the inverse.

39
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,000
And finally,
just so you know what's covered

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in from chapter three,
it's section six point one and

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
two, so that's the basic idea of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,970
the equation for the
eigenvalues, the mechanical

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,000
step, this is really Ax equal
lambda x for all n eigenvectors

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
at once, if we have n
independent eigenvectors,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and then using that to compute
powers of a matrix.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you notice the differential
equations not on this list,

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,800
because that's six point three,
that that's for the third quiz.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,000
OK.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Shall I what I usually do for
review is to take an old exam

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and just try to pick out
questions that are significant

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and write them quickly on the
board, shall I -- shall I

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
proceed that way
again?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This -- this exam is really
old.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
November nineteen -- nineteen
eighty-four, so that was before

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the Web existed.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,290
So not only were the lectures
not on the Web,

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,000
nobody even had a Web page,
my God.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
OK, so can I nevertheless
linear algebra was still as

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
great as ever.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So may I and that wasn't meant
to be a joke,

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OK, all right,
so let me just take these

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
questions as they come.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All right.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So the first question's about
projections.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It says we're given the line,
the -- the vector a is the

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
vector two, one,
two, and I want to find the

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
projection matrix P that
projects onto the line through

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
a.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,710
So my picture is,
well I'm in three dimensions,

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,000
of course, so there's a vector,
two -- there's the vector a,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
two, one, two,
let me draw the whole line

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
through it, and I want to
project

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
any vector b onto that line,
and I'm looking for the

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
projection matrix.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So -- so this -- the projection
matrix is the matrix that I

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
multiply b by to get here.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I guess this first part,
this is just part one a,

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm really asking you the --
the quick way to answer,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to find P, is just to remember
what

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the formula is.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And -- and we're in -- we're
projecting onto a line,

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
so our formula,
our -- our usual formula is AA

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
transpose A inverse A transpose,
but now A is just a column,

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
one-column matrix,
so it'll be just a,

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
so I'll just call it little a,
little a transpose,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and this is just
a number now,

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
one by one, so I can put it in
the denominator,

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
so there's our -- that's really
what we want to remember,

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and -- and using that two,
one, two, what will I get?

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm dividing by -- what's the
length squared of that vector?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So what's a transpose a?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Looks like nine,
and what's the matrix,

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,890
well, I'm -- I'm doing two,
one, two against two,

95
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,000
one, two, so it's one-ninth of
this matrix four,

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
two, four, two,
one, two, four,

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
two, four.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now the next part asked about
eigenvalues.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you see we're -- since we're
learning, we know a lot more

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
now, we can make connections
between these chapters,

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
so what's the eigenvector,
what are the eigenvalues of P?

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I could ask what's the rank of
P.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's the rank of that matrix?

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Uh -- one.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Rank is one.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's the column space?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,190
If I apply P to all vectors
then I fill up the column space,

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,000
it's combinations of the
columns, so what's the column

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
space?
Well, it's just this line.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The column space is the line
through two, one,

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,890
two.

112
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,000
And now what's the
eigenvalue?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So, or since that matrix has
rank one, so tell me the

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
eigenvalues of this matrix.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a singular matrix,
so it certainly has an

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
eigenvalue zero.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Actually, the rank is only one,
so that means that there like

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
going to be t- a
two-dimensional null space,

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
there'll be at least two,
this lambda equals zero will be

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
repeated twice because I can
find two independent

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,080
eigenvectors with lambda equals
zero, and then of course since

122
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,000
it's got three eigenvalues,
what's the third one?

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's one.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How do I know it's one?

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Either from the trace,
which is nine over nine,

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
which is one,
or by remembering what -- what

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is the eigenvector,
and actually now it's going to

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ask for the eigenvector,
so what's the eigenvector for

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that eigenvalue?

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's the eigenvector for that
eigenvalue?

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's the -- it's the vector
that doesn't move,

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
eigenvalue one,
so the vector that doesn't move

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
is a.
This a is the -- is -- is also
the eigenvector with lambda

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
equal one, because if I apply
the projection matrix to a,

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I get a again.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Everybody sees that if I apply
that matrix to a,

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,210
can I do it in little letters,
if I apply that matrix to a,

138
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,000
then I have a transpose a
canceling a transpose a and I

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
get a again.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So sure enough,
Pa equals a.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And the eigenvalue is one.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OK.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Good.
now, actually it asks you

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,580
further to solve
this difference equation,

145
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:34,000
so this will be -- this is --
this is solve u(k+1)=Puk,

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
starting from u0 equal nine,
nine, zero.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And find uk.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So -- so what's up?

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shall we find u1 first of all?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So just to get started.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So what is u1?

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's Pu0 of course.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So if I do the projection of --
of this vector onto the line,

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so this is like my vector b now
that I'm projecting onto the

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
line, I get a times a transpose
u0 over a transpose a.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, one way or another I just
do this multiplication.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but maybe this is the easiest
way to do it.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
a transpose,
can I remember what a is on

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this board?
Two, one, two,
so I'm projecting onto the line

160
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,000
through there.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is the projection,
it's P times the vector u0,

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
so what do I have for a
transpose u0 looks like

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
eighteen, looks like
twenty-seven,

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and a transpose a we figured
was nine,

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
so it's three a,
so that this is the -- this is

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the x hat, the -- the multiple
of a, in -- in our formulas,

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and of course that's six,
three, six.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So that's u1.

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Computed out directly.

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's on the line through a
and it's the closest point to

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
u0, and it's just Pu0.

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You just
straightforward multiplication

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
produces that.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
OK.
Now, what's u2?

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,970
Well, u2 is Pu1,
I agree.

176
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,000
Do I need to compute that
again?

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, because once I'm already on
the line through A,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
uk will be, I could do the
projection k times,

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
but it's enough just to do it
once.

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's the same,
it's the same,

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
six, three, six.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So this is a case where I could
and -- and actually on the quiz

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
if you see one of these,
which could very well be there,

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and it could very well be not a
projection matrix,

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
then we would use all the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's think for a moment,
how do

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you do those?

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
M - the point of this small
part of a question was that when

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
P is a projection matrix,
so that P squared equals P and

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
P cubed equals P,
then -- then we don't need to

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
get into the mechanics of all
knowing all the other

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We just
can go directly.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But if P was now some other
matrix, can you just -- let's

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
just remember from these very
recent lectures how you would

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
proceed.
from these very recent lectures

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
we know that uk we would -- we
would expand u0 as a combination

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
of eigenvectors.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let me leave -- yeah,
as a combination of

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
eigenvectors,
c1x1, some multiple of the

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
second eigenvector,
some multiple of the third

202
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
eigenvector, and then A to the
ku0 would be c1,

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
so this -- we have to find
these numbers here,

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that's the work actually.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The work
is find the eigenvalues,

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
find the eigenvectors and find
the c-s because they all come

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
into the formula.

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We have -- so -- so to do this,
you can see what you have to

209
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
compute.

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You have to compute the
eigenvalues, you have to compute

211
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
the eigenvectors,
and then to match u0 you

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
compute the c-s,
and

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
then you've got it.

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So it's -- it's just that's a
formula that shows what pieces

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
we need.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And what would actually happen
in the case of this projection

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
matrix?

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If this A is a projection
matrix, then a couple of

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
eigenvalues are zero.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's why we just throw those
away.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The other eigenvalue was a one,
so that we got the same thing

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
every time, c3x3.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
From the first time,
second time,

224
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
third, all iterations pro- left
us with this constant,

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
left us right here at six,
three, six.

226
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But maybe I take -- I'm taking
this chance to remind you

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
of what to do for other
matrices.

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000
OK.
So that's part way through.

229
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
OK.
The next question in nineteen
eighty-four is fitting a

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,510
straight line to points.

231
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,000
And actually a straight line
through the origin.

232
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
A straight line through the
origin.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,910
So can I go to question two?

234
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,000
So this is fitting a straight
line to

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
these points,
can I -- I'll just give you the

236
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
points at t=1 the y is four,
at t=2, y is five,

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
at t=3, y is eight.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So we've got points one,
two, three, four,

239
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
five, and eight.

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I'm trying to fit a
straight line through the origin

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
to
these three values.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
OK, so my equation that I'm
allowing myself is just y equal

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Dt.

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So I have only one unknown.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
One degree of freedom.

246
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
One parameter D.

247
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So I'm expecting to end up my
matrix so my -- my -- when I try

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to -- when I try to fit a
straight line,

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that goes through the origin,
that's because it goes through

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the origin, I've lost the
constant c here,

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
so I have just this should be a
quick calculation.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I can write down the three
equations that -- that -- that

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,270
would -- I'd like to solve if
the line went through the

254
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,000
points, that's a good start.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Because that displays the
matrix.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So can I continue that problem?

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We would like to solve-- so y
is Dt, so I'd like to solve D

258
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
times one times D equals four,
two times D equals five and

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
three times D equals eight.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That would be perfection.

261
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If I could find such a D,
then the line y equal Dt would

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
satisfy all three equations,
would go through all three

263
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
points, but it doesn't exist.

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So -- so I have to solve this
-- so the -- my matrix is now

265
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,730
you can see my matrix,
it just has one column.

266
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,890
Multiplying a scalar D.

267
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,000
And you can see the right-hand
side.

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
This is my Ax=b.

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't need three equals signs
now because I've got vectors.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,000
OK.
There's Ax=b and you take it
from there.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You the -- the best x will be
-- will come from -- so what's

272
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the -- the key equation?

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So this is the A,
this is the Ax hat equal b

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
equation.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, Ax=b.

276
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And what's the equation
for x hat?

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The best D, so to find the best
D, the best x,

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the equation is A transpose A,
the best D, is A transpose

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
times the right-hand side.

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is all coming from
projection on a line,

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,730
our -- our matrix only has one
column.

282
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,000
So A transpose A would be maybe
fourteen, D hat,

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and A transpose b I'm getting
four, ten, and twenty-four.

284
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is that right?

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Four, ten and twenty-four.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So thirty-eight.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,900
So that tells me the best D hat
is D hat is thirty-eight over

288
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,000
fourteen.

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OK.
Fine.

290
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,000
All right.
so we found the best line.

291
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And now here's a -- here's the
next question.

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What vector did I just project
onto what line?

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
See in this section on least
squares here's the key point,

294
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm -- I'm asking you to think
of the least squares problem in

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
two
ways.

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Two different pictures.

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Two different graphs.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
One graph is this.

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,780
This is a graph in the -- in
the b -- in the tb plane,

300
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,450
ty plane.

301
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,000
The -- the -- the line itself.

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The other picture I'm asking
you to think of is like my

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
projection picture.

304
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,440
What -- what projection --
what -- what vector I -- I

305
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,000
projecting onto what line or
what subspace when I -- when I

306
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,000
do this?
So the -- my second picture is
a projection picture that --

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
that sees the whole thing with
vectors.

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Here's my vector of course that
I'm projecting.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm projecting that vector b
onto the column space of A.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Of if you like -- it's just a
line onto that's the line it's

311
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
just a line, of course.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's what this calculation is
doing.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is computing the best D,
which is -- this is the x hat.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So -- so seeing it as a
projection means I don't see the

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,080
projection in this figure,
right?

316
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,000
In this figure I'm not
projecting

317
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
those points onto that line or
anything of the sort.

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The projection s-picture for --
for least squares is in the --

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in the space where b lies,
the whole vector b,

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and the columns of A.

321
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then the x is the best
combination that gives the

322
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
projection.

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OK.
So that's a chance to tell me
that.

324
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,000
OK.
I'll go -- OK now finally in
orthogonality there's the

325
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Graham-Schmidt idea.

326
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So that's problem two D here.

327
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It asks me if I have two
vectors, a1 equal one,

328
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
two, three, and a2 equal one,
one, one, find two orthogonal

329
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
vectors in that plane.

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So those two vectors give a
plane, they give a plane.

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Which is of course the -- the
column space of the -- of the

332
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
matrix.

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I'm looking for an
orthogonal basis for that plane.

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So I'm looking for two
orthogonal vectors.

335
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And of course there are lots of
--

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I mean, I've got a plane there.

337
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If I get one orthogonal pair,
I can rotate it.

338
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There's not just one answer
here.

339
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But Graham-Schmidt says OK,
start with the first vector,

340
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and let that be -- and keep
that one.

341
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And then take the second one
orthogonal to this.

342
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So -- so Graham-Schmidt says
start

343
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
with this one and then make a
second vector B,

344
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
can I call that second vector
B, this is going to be

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
orthogonal to,
so perpendicular to a1.

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If I can with my chalk create
the key equation.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This vector B is going to be
this one, one,

348
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
one, but that one,
one --

349
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
one, one, one is not
perpendicular to a1,

350
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
so I have to subtract off its
projection, I have to subtract

351
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
off the B, the -- the B trans-
ye the B -- the -- the I should

352
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
say the a1 transpose b over a1
transpose a1,

353
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
that multiple of a1,
I've got to remove.

354
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So I just have
to compute what that is,

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and I get ano- I get a vector B
that's orthogonal to a1.

356
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's the -- it's -- it's the
original vector minus its

357
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
projection.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,300
Oh, so what is -- I mean this
to be a2.

359
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah.

360
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So I'm projecting a2 onto the
line through a1.

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,970
That's the part that I don't
want

362
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,000
because that's in the direction
I already have,

363
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,620
so I subtract off that
projection and I get the part I

364
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,630
want, the orthogonal part.

365
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,000
OK.

366
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So that's the Graham-Schmidt
thing and we can put numbers in.

367
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
one, one, one take away a1
transpose a2 is six,

368
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
a1 transpose a1 is
fourteen,multiplying a1.

369
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And that gives us the new
orthogonal vector B.

370
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Because I only ask for
orthogonal right now,

371
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I don't have to divide by the
length which will involve a

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
square root.

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OK.

374
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Third question.

375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Third question.

376
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,150
All right,
let me -- I'll move this board

377
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,000
up.
third question will probably be

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
about eigenvalues.

379
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,000
OK.
Three.

380
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,130
This is a four-by-four matrix.

381
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,000
Its eigenvalues are lambda one,
lambda two, lambda three,

382
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
lambda four.

383
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Question one.

384
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,650
What's the condition on the
lambdas so that the matrix is

385
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,000
invertible?

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OK.

387
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,530
So under what conditions on the
lambdas will the matrix be

388
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,000
invertible?

389
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So that's easy.

390
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Invertible if what's the
condition on the lambdas?

391
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
None of them are zero.

392
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
A zero eigenvalue would mean
something in the null space

393
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
would mean a solution to Ax=0x,
but we're invertible,

394
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
so none of
them is zero,

395
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the product -- however you want
to say, no -- no zero

396
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
eigenvalues.

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Good.
OK, what's the determinant of A
inverse?

398
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,000
The determinant of A inverse?

399
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So where is that going to come
from?

400
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, if we knew the
eigenvalues of A inverse,

401
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,130
we could multiply them together
to find the determinant.

402
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,000
And we do know the eigenvalues
of A inverse.

403
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What are they?

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They're just one over lambda
one times one over lambda two,

405
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
that's the second eigenvalue,
the third eigenvalue and the

406
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000
fourth.
So the product of the four
eigenvalues of the inverse

407
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
will give us the determinant of
the inverse.

408
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Fine.
OK.

409
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And what's the trace of A plus
I?

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So what do we know about trace?

411
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,080
It's the sum down the diagonal,
but we don't know what our

412
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,000
matrix is.

413
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The trace is also the sum of
the eigenvalues,

414
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,650
and we do know the eigenvalues
of A

415
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,000
plus I.

416
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So we just add them up.

417
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,390
So what -- what's the first
eigenvalue of A plus I?

418
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,000
When the matrix A has
eigenvalues lambda one,

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
two, three and four,
then the eigenvalues if I add

420
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the identity,
that moves all the eigenvalues

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
by one,
so I just add up lambda one

422
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
plus one, lambda two plus one,
and so on, lambda three plus

423
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
one, lambda four plus one,
so it's lambda one plus lambda

424
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
two plus lambda three plus
lambda four plus four.

425
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Right.

426
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That movement by the identity
moved all the eigenvalues by

427
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
one, so it moved
the whole trace by four.

428
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So it was the trace of A plus
four more.

429
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,000
OK.
Let's see.

430
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We may be finished this quiz
twenty minutes early.

431
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No.
There's another question.

432
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, God, OK.

433
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
How did this class ever do it?

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, you'll see.
you'll be able to do it.

435
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
OK.
this has got to be a

436
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
determinant question.

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
All right.

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
More determinants and cofactors
and big formula question.

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
OK.
Let me do that.

440
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So it's about a matrix,
a -- a whole family of

441
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
matrices.

442
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Here's the four-by-four one.

443
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The four-by-four one is,
and -- and all the matrices in

444
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
this family are tridiagonal with
-- with ones.

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Otherwise zeroes.

446
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So that's the pattern,
and we've seen this matrix.

447
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,480
OK.

448
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,000
So the -- it's tridiagonal with
ones on the diagonal,

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
ones above and ones below,
and you see the general formula

450
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,560
An, so I'll use Dn for the
determinant

451
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,000
of An.

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
OK.
All right.

453
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So I'm going to do a -- the
first question is use cofactors

454
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
to show that Dn is something
times D(n-1) plus something

455
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
times D(n-2).

456
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And find those somethings.

457
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,000
OK.
So this -- the fact that it's
tridiagonal with

458
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
these constant diagonals means
that there is such a recurrence

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,620
formula.

460
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,000
And so the first question is
find it.

461
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Well, what's the recurrence
formula?

462
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
OK, how does it go?

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So I'll use cofactors along the
first row.

464
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So I take that number times its
cofactor.

465
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So it's one times its cofactor
and what is its cofactor?

466
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
D(n-1), right,
exactly, the cofactor is this

467
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,150
-- is this guy uses up row one
and column one,

468
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,000
so the cofactor is down here,
so it's one of those.

469
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
OK, that's the first cofactor
term.

470
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Now the other cofactor term is
this guy.

471
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Which uses up row one and
column two and what's surprising

472
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
about that?

473
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,930
When you use row one and column
two that brings in a minus.

474
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:35,000
There'll be a minus because the
-- the cofactor is this

475
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,970
determinant times minus one.

476
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,000
The the one-two cofactor
is that determinant with its

477
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
sign changed.

478
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
OK.

479
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So I have to look at that
determinant and I have to

480
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
remember in my head a sign is
going to get changed.

481
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
OK.
Now how do I do that
determinant?

482
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
How do I make that one clear?

483
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,530
I -- the --
the neat way to do is -- is

484
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,000
here I see I -- I'll use
cofactors down the first column.

485
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Because the first column is all
zeroes except for that one,

486
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
so this one is now -- and
what's its cofactor?

487
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Within this three-by-three its
cofactor will be two-by-two,

488
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and what is it?

489
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's this, right?

490
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So -- so that part is all gone,
so I'm taking that times its

491
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
cofactor, then zero times
whatever its cofactor is,

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
so it's really just one times
and what's this in the general

493
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
n-by-n case?

494
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's Dn minus two.

495
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But now so is this a plus or
sign or a minus sign,

496
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it's -- it's just a one,
because there's a one from

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
there and a one from there.

498
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,310
And is it a plus or a minus?

499
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,000
It's minus I guess because
there was a minus the first time

500
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and then the second time
it's a plus,

501
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,270
so it's overall it's a minus.

502
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,930
So there's my a and b were one
and minus one.

503
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,000
Those constants.

504
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Th- that's the -- that's the
recurrence.

505
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
OK.

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And oh, then it asks you to
then it asks you to solve this

507
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
thing first by
writing it as a -- as a system.

508
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So now I'd like to know the
solution.

509
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I -- I better know how it
starts, right?

510
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,280
It starts with D1,
what was D1,

511
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,000
that's just the one-by-one
case, so D1 is one,

512
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and what is D2?

513
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Just to get us started and then
this would give us D3,

514
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
D4, and forever.

515
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
D2 is this two-by-two that I'm
seeing here and that determinant

516
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
is obviously zero.

517
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So those little ones will start
the recurrence and then we take

518
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,000
off.
And then the idea is to write
this recurrence as --

519
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,000
as a Dn, D(n-1) is some matrix
times the one before,

520
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the D(n-1), D(n-2).

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What's the matrix?

522
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You see, you remember this step
of taking a single second order

523
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,750
equation and by introducing a
vector unknown to make it into a

524
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,000
--
to a first order system.

525
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,000
OK.
So Dn is one of Dn minus one
minus one, I think that -- that

526
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
goes in the first row,
right?

527
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
From the equation above?

528
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And the second one is this is
the same as this,

529
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
so one and zero are fine.

530
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So there's the matrix.

531
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
OK.

532
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So now how do I proceed?

533
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We can guess what this
examiner's got in his little

534
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
mind.
well, find the eigenvalues.

535
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And actually it tells us that
the sixth power of these

536
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
eigenvalues turns out to be one.

537
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Uh, well, can -- can we get the
equation for the eigenvalues?

538
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Let's do it and let's get a
formula for them.

539
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,000
OK.
So what are the eigenvalues?

540
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I look at the -- the matrix,
this determinant one minus

541
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,310
lambda and zero minus lambda,
and these guys are still there,

542
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,000
I compute that determinant,
I get lambda squared minus

543
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
lambda
and then plus one.

544
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I set that to zero.

545
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,000
OK.
So we're not Fibonacci here.

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We're -- we're not seeing
Fibonacci numbers.

547
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because the sign -- we had a
sign change there.

548
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,250
And it's not clear right away
whether these -- whether this --

549
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,490
is it clear?

550
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,000
Is this matrix stable or
unstable?

551
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
When we take -- when we go
further and further out?

552
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Are these Ds increasing?

553
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Are they going to zero?

554
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Are they bouncing around
periodically?

555
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the answers have to be here.

556
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I would like to know how big
these lambdas are,

557
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
right?

558
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And the point is probably these
-- let's -- let's see,

559
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
what's lambda?

560
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
From the quadratic formula
lambda is one,

561
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I switch the sign of that,
plus or minus the square root

562
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
of one minus 4ac,
I getting a minus three there?

563
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Over two.

564
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What's up?

565
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They're complex.

566
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The -- the eigenvalues are one
plus square root of three I over

567
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
two and one minus square root of
three I over two.

568
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What's the magnitude of lambda?

569
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That's the key point for
stability.

570
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
These are two numbers in the
complex plane.

571
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
One plus some --
somewhere here,

572
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and its complex conjugate
there.

573
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to know how far from the
origin are those numbers.

574
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What's the magnitude of lambda?

575
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And do you see what it is?

576
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Do you recognize this -- a
number like that?

577
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Take the real part squared and
the imaginary part squared and

578
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
add.

579
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What do you get?

580
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So the real part squared is a
quarter.

581
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The imaginary part squared is
three-quarters.

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They add to one.

583
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's a number with -- that's
on the unit circle.

584
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's an e to the i theta.

585
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's a
cos(theta)+isin(theta).

586
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And what's theta?

587
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This -- this is like a complex
number that's worth knowing,

588
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
it's not totally obvious but
it's nice.

589
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's -- I should see that as
cos(theta)+isin(theta),

590
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and the angle that would do
that is

591
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
sixty degrees,
pi over three.

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So that's a -- let me improve
my picture.

593
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So those -- that's e to the i
pi over six -- pi over three.

594
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This is -- this number is e to
the i pi over three and e to the

595
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
minus i pi over three.

596
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We'll be doing more complex
numbers

597
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
briefly but a little more in
the next two days.

598
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
next two lectures.

599
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Anyway, the -- so what's the
deal with stability,

600
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
what do the Dn-s do?

601
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Well, look, if -- if I take the
sixth power I'm around at one,

602
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
the problem actually told me
this.

603
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,510
The sixth power of those
eigenvalues brings me around to

604
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,000
one.

605
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
What does that tell you about
the matrix, by the way?

606
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Suppose you know -- this was a
great quiz question,

607
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,610
so I should never have just
said it, but popped out.

608
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,570
Suppose lambda one to the sixth
and

609
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,000
lambda two to the sixth are --
are one, which they are.

610
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What does that tell me about a
m- a matrix?

611
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
About my matrix A here.

612
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Well, what -- what matrix is
connected with lambda one to the

613
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
sixth and lambda two to the
sixth?

614
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's got to be the matrix
A to the sixth.

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,370
So what is A to the sixth for
that matrix?

616
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,000
It's got eigenvalues one and
one.

617
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Because when I take the sixth
power, actually,

618
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ye, if I take the sixth power
b- all the sixth power of that

619
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is one and the sixth power of
that

620
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
is one, the sixth power of this
is e to the two pi i,

621
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that's one, the sixth power of
this is e to the minus two pi i,

622
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,230
that's one.

623
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,000
So the sixth powers,
the -- the sixth power of that

624
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
matrix has eigenvalues one and
one, so what is it?

625
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's the identity,
right.

626
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,590
So if I operate this -- if I
run this thing six times,

627
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,310
I'm back where I was.

628
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,000
The sixth power of that matrix
is the identity.

629
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Good.
OK.
So it'll loop around,
it's -- it doesn't go to zero,

630
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
it doesn't blow up,
it just periodically goes

631
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
around with period six.

632
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
OK.
let's just see if there's a --

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
all right.

634
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'll -- let's see.

635
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Could I also look at a -- at a
final exam from nineteen

636
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
ninety-two.

637
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think that's yeah,
let me do that on this last

638
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
board.

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It starts -- a lot of the
questions in this exam are about

640
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
a family of matrices.

641
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Let me give you the fourth,
the fourth guy in the family is

642
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
-- has a one,
so it's zeroes on the diagonal,

643
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
but these are going one,
two, three and so on.

644
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
One, two, three,
and so on.

645
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But, for the four-by-four case
I'm stopping at four.

646
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You see the pattern?

647
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's a family of matrices which
is growing, and actually the

648
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
numbers -- it's symmetric,
right, it's equal to A4

649
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
transpose.

650
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And we can ask all sorts of
questions about its

651
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
null space, its range,
r- its column space find the

652
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
projection matrix onto the
column space of A3,

653
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
for example,
is in here.

654
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So -- so one -- so A3 is zero,
one, zero, one,

655
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
zero, two, zero,
two, zero.

656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
OK, find the projection matrix
onto

657
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the column space.

658
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
By the way, is that matrix
singular or invertible?

659
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Singular.

660
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Why do we know it's singular?

661
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I see that column three is a
multiple of column one.

662
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Or we could take its
determinant.

663
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So it's certainly singular.

664
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,370
The projection
will be matrix will be

665
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:03,000
three-by-three but it will
project onto the column space,

666
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
it'll project onto this plane.

667
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The column space of A3,
and I guess I would find it

668
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
from the formula AA -- AA
transpose A inverse,

669
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I would have to -- I would -- I
guess I would do all

670
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
this.

671
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
There may be a better way,
perhaps I could think there

672
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,920
might be a slightly quicker way,
but that would come out pretty

673
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,000
fast.

674
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,530
OK.

675
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,000
So that's be the projection
matrix.

676
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Next question.

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Find the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that matrix.

678
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,990
OK.

679
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,000
There's a three-by-three
matrix, oh, yeah,

680
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
so what are its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors,

681
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
we haven't done any
three-by-threes.

682
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's do one.

683
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I want to find,
so how do I find eigenvalues?

684
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I take the determinant of A3
minus lambda I.

685
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So this is you just have to --
so I'm subtracting lambda from

686
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
the diagonal,
and I have a one,

687
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
one, zero, zero,
two, two there,

688
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,820
and I just have to find that
determinant.

689
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,000
OK, since it's three-by-three
I'll just go for it.

690
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This way gives me minus lambda
cubed and a zero and zero.

691
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Then in this direction which
has the minus sign,

692
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that's a zero,
four lambdas,

693
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I mean minus four lambdas,
and minus another lambda,

694
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so that's minus five lambdas,
but that direction goes with a

695
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,660
minus sign, so I think it's plus
five lambda.

696
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,000
That looks like the determinant
of A3 minus lambda I,

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
so I set it to zero.

698
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,090
So what are the eigenvalues?

699
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,000
Well, lambda equals zero --
lambda factors out of this,

700
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,820
times minus lambda
squared plus four,

701
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,000
so the eigenvalues are five,
thanks, thanks,

702
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
so the eigenvalues are zero,
square root of five,

703
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and minus square root of five.

704
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I would never write down
those three eigenvalues without

705
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
checking the trace to tell the
truth.

706
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Because -- because we did
a bunch of calculations here

707
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
but then I can quickly add up
the eigenvalues to get zero,

708
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
add up the trace to get zero,
and feel that I'm -- well,

709
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I guess that wouldn't have
caught my error if I'd made it

710
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
-- if -- if that had been
a four I wouldn't have

711
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
noticed,the determinant isn't
anything greatly useful here,

712
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
right, because the determinant
is just zero.

713
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And so I never would know
whether that five was right or

714
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
wrong, but thanks for making it
right.

715
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,000
OK.
Ha.

716
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,000
Question two c,
whoever wrote this,

717
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
probably me,
said this is not difficult.

718
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't know why I put that in.
just -- it asks for the

719
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
projection matrix onto the
column space of A4.

720
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
How could I have thought that
wasn't difficult?

721
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It looks extremely difficult.
what's the projection matrix

722
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
onto the column space of A4?

723
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I don't know whether that --
this is not difficult is just

724
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
like helpful or -- or insulting.

725
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Uh, what do you think?

726
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The -- what's the column space
of A4 here?

727
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well, what's our first question
is

728
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
is the matrix singular or
invertible?

729
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
If the answer is invertible,
then what's the column space?

730
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
If -- if this matrix A4 is
invertible, so that's my guess,

731
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,200
if this problem's easy it has
to be because this matrix is

732
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,000
probably invertible.

733
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Then its column space is R^4,
good, the column space is the

734
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
whole space, and the answer to
this easy question is the

735
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
projection matrix is the
identity, it's the four-by-four

736
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
identity matrix.

737
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If this matrix is invertible.

738
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Shall we check invertibility?

739
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
How would you find its
determinant?

740
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Can we just like take the
determinant of that matrix?

741
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I could ask you how -- so there
-- there are twenty-four terms,

742
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
do we want to write all
twenty-four terms down?

743
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
not in the remaining ten
seconds.

744
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Better to use cofactors.

745
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So I go along row one,
I see one -- the only nonzero

746
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,410
is this guy, so I should take
that one times the cofactor.

747
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,000
Now so I'm down to this
determinant.

748
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OK.
So now I'm -- look at this
first column,

749
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I see one times this,
there's the

750
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
cofactor of the one,
so I'm using up row one -- row

751
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
one and column one of this
three-by-three matrix,

752
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm down to this cofactor,
and by the way,

753
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
those were both plus signs,
right?

754
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No, they weren't.

755
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That was a minus sign.

756
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That was a --
that was a minus,

757
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,980
and then that was a plus,
and then this,

758
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,000
so what's the determinant?

759
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Nine.

760
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Nine.
Determinant is nine.

761
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Determinant of A4 is nine.

762
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
OK.

763
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Where A3, so my guess is I'll
put that on the final this year,

764
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
the -- probably the odd-
numbered ones are singular and

765
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,140
the even-numbered ones are
invertible.

766
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,000
And I don't know what the
determinants are but I'm betting

767
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that they have some nice
formula.

768
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,000
OK.
So, recitations this week will
also be quiz review and then the

769
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
quiz is Wednesday at one
o'clock.

770
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Thanks.
