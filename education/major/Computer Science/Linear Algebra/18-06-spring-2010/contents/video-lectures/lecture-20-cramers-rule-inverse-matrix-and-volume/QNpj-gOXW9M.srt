1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OK, this is lecture twenty.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And this is the final lecture
on determinants.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And it's about the
applications.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we worked hard in the last
two lectures to get a formula

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for the determinant and the
properties of the determinant.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now to use the determinant and,
and always this determinant

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
packs
all this information into a

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
single number.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And that number can give us
formulas for all sorts of,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
things that we've been
calculating already without

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
formulas.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now what was A inverse?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,420
So, so I'm beginning with the
formula for A inverse.

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,000
Two, two by two formula we
know,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
right?
The two by two formula for A
inverse, the inverse of a b c d

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
inverse is one over the
determinant times d a -b -c.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Somehow I want to see what's
going on for three by three and

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
n by n.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And actually maybe you can see
what's going on from this two by

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
two case.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So there's a formula
for the inverse,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and what did I divide by?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The determinant.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So what I'm looking for is a
formula where it has one over

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the determinant and,
and you remember why that makes

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
good sense, because then that's
perfect as long as the

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
determinant isn't zero,
and that's exactly when there

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
is an
inverse.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But now I have to ask can we
recognize any of this stuff?

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Do you recognize what that
number d is from the past?

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
From last, from the last
lecture?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
My hint is think cofactors.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because my formula is going to
be, my formula for the inverse

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
is going to be one over the
determinant times

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
a matrix of cofactors.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So you remember that D?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What's that the cofactor of?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Remember cofactors?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If -- that's the one one
cofactor, because if I strike

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
out row and column one,
I'm left with d.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And what's minus b?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
OK.
Which cofactor is that one?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,650
Oh, minus b is the cofactor of
c,

44
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,000
right?

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If I strike out the c,
I'm left with a b there.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And why the minus sign?

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because this c was in a two one
position, and two plus one is

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
odd.
So there was a minus went into
the cofactor,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and that's it.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OK.
I'll write down next what my
formula is.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Here's the big formula for the
A -- for A inverse.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's one over the determinant
of A and then some matrix.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And that matrix is the matrix
of cofactors,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
c.
Only one thing,
it turns -- you'll see,

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to, I transpose.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So this is the matrix of
cofactors,

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the -- what I'll just -- but
why don't we just call it the

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
cofactor matrix.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So the one one entry of,
of c is the cof- is the one one

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
cofactor, the thing that we get
by throwing away row and column

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
one.
It's the d.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And, because of the transpose,
what I see up here is the

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
cofactor of this guy down here,
right?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's where the transpose came
in.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What I see here,
this is the cofactor not of

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
this one, because I've
transposed.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is the cofactor of the b.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When I throw away the b,
the b row and the b column,

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm left with c,
and then I have that minus sign

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
again.
And of course the two two entry
is the cofactor of d,

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,590
and that's this a.

72
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,000
OK.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So there's the formula.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But we got to think why.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, it worked in this two
by two case, but a lot of other

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
formulas would
have worked just as well.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We, we have to see why that's
true.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In other words,
why is it -- so this is what I

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
aim to find.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And, and let's just sort of
look to see what is that telling

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
us.
That tells us that the --
the expression for A inverse --

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,730
let's look at a three by three.

83
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,000
Can I just write down a a b c d
e f g h i?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I'm looking for its
inverse.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And what kind of a formula --
do I see there?

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean, what -- the determinant
is a bunch of products of three

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,010
factors, right?

88
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,000
The determinant of this
matrix'll

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
involve a e i,
and b f times g,

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,860
and c times d times h,
and minus c e g,

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,000
and so on.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So things with three factors go
in here.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Things with how many factors do
things in the cofactor matrix

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
have?
What's a typical cofactor?

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What's
the cofactor of a?

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The cofactor of a,
the one one entry up here in

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the inverse is?

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I throw away the row and column
containing a and I take the

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,120
determinant of what's left,
that's the cofactor.

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,000
And that's e i minus f h.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Products of two things.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now,
I'm just making the observation

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that the determinant of A
involves products of n entries.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the cofactor matrix
involves products of n minus 1

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
entries.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And, like, we never noticed any
of this stuff when we were

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
computing the inverse by the
Gauss-Jordan method or whatever.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,580
You remember how we did it?

109
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,000
We took the matrix A,
we tucked the identity next to

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
it, we did elimination till A
became the identity.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then that,
the identity suddenly was A

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
inverse.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, that was great
numerically.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But we never knew what was
going on, basically.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And now we see what the formula
is

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
in terms of letters,
what's the algebra instead of

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the algorithm.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OK.
But I have to say why this is
right, right?

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I still -- that's a pretty
magic formula.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Where does it come from?

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, I'll just check it.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Having,
having got it up there,

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
let me -- I'll say,
how can we check -- what do I

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
want to check?

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I want to check that A times
its inverse gives the identity.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I want, I want to check that
A times this thing,

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A times this -- now I'm going
to write in the inverse -- gives

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the identity.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I check that A times C
transpose -- let me bring the

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
determinant up here.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Determinant of A times the
identity.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's my job.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,020
That's it, that if this is
true, and it is,

134
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,000
then, then I've correctly
identified A inverse as C

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
transpose divided by the
determinant.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
OK.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But why is this true?

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why is that true?

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let me, let me put down what
I'm doing here.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I have A -- here,
here's A, here's a11 -- I'm

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
doing this multiplication --
along to a1n.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And then down in this last row
will be an an1 along to ann.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I'm multiplying by the
cofactor matrix transposed.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So when I transpose,
it'll be c11 c12 down to c1n.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Notice usually that one coming
first would mean I'm in row one,

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
but I've transposed,
so that's, those are the

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
cofactors.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This first column are the
cofactors from row one.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And then the last column would
be the cofactors from row n.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And why should that come out to
be anything good?

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
In fact, why should it come out
to be as good as this?

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, you can tell me what the
one one entry in the product is.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is like you're seeing the
main point if you just tell me

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
one entry.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What do I get up there in the
one

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
one entry when I do this row of
this row from A times this

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
column of cofactors?

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What, what will I get there?

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because we have seen this.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I mean, we're,
right, building exactly on what

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the last lecture reached.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So this is a11 times c11,
a12 times c12,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
a1n times c1n.

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
What does that what does that
sum up to?

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,340
That's the cofactor formula for
the determinant.

166
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,000
That's the, this cofactor
formula, which I wrote,

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
which we got last time.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The determinant of A is,
if I use row one,

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
let,
let I equal one,

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
then I have a11 times its
cofactor, a12 times its

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
cofactor, and so on.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that gives me the
determinant.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it worked in this,
in this case.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This row times this thing is,
sure enough,

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ad minus bc.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But this formula says it always
works.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So up here in this,
in this position,

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm getting determinant of A.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What about in the two two
position?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Row two times column two there,
what, what is that?

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's just the cofactors,
that's just row two times its

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
cofactors.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So of course I get the
determinant

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,180
again.

185
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,900
And in the last here,
this is the last row times its

186
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,000
cofactors.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's exactly -- you see,
we're realizing that the

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
cofactor formula is just this
sum of products,

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
so of course we think,
hey, we've got a matrix

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
multiplication there.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,060
And we get determinant of A.

192
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,000
Great.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But there's one more idea here,
right?

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What else, what have I not --
so I haven't got that formula

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
completely proved yet,
because I've still got to do

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
all the off-diagonal stuff,
which I want to be zero,

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
right?
I just want this to be
determinant of A times the

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
identity, and then I'm,
I'm a happy person.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So why should that be?

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why should it be that one row
times the cofactors from a

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
different row,
which become a column because I

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
transpose, give zero?

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In other words,
the cofactor formula gives the

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
determinant if the
row and the,

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and the cofactors -- you know,
if the entries of A and the

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
cofactors are for the same row.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But for some reason,
if I take the cofactors from

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the -- entries from the first
row and the cofactors from the

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
second row,
for some reason I automatically

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
get zero.
And it's sort of like
interesting to say,

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
why does that happen?

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And can I just check that -- of
course, we know it happens,

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
in this case.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Here are the numbers from row
one and here are the cofactors

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
from row two,
right?

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Those are the numbers in row
one.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And th- these are the cofactors
from row two,

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because the cofactor of c is
minus b and the cofactor of d is

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a.
And sure enough,
that row times this column

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
gives -- please say it.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Zero, right.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
OK.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So now how come?

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
How come?

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Can we even see it in
this two by two case?

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why did -- well,
I mean, I guess we,

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you know, in one way we
certainly do see it,

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
because it's right here.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I mean, do we just do it,
and then we get zero.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But we want to think of some
reason why the answer's zero,

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
some reason that we can use in
the n by n case.

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So let -- here,
here is my thinking.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We must be, if we're getting
the answer's zero,

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
we suspect that what we're
doing somehow,

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
we're taking the determinant of
some matrix that has two equal

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
rows.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So I believe that if we
multiply these by the cofactors

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
from some other row,
we're taking the determinant --

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
ye, what matrix are we taking
the determinant of?

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Here it's, this is it.

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We're, when we do that times
this, we're really taking -- can

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I put this in little letters
down here?

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,470
I'm taking -- let me look at
the matrix a b a b.

244
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,000
Let me call that matrix AS,
A screwed up.

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
OK.
All right.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So now that matrix is certainly
singular.

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So if we find its determinant,
we're going to get zero.

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But I claim that if we find its
determinant by the cofactor

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
rule,
go along the first row,

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
we would take a times the
cofactor of a.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And what is the -- see,
how -- oh no -- let me go along

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the second row.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,050
OK.

254
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,000
So let's see,
which -- if I take -- I know

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I've got a singular matrix here.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I believe that when I do
this multiplication,

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
what I'm doing is using the
cofactor formula for the

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
determinant.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I know I'm going to get
zero.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Let me try this again.

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,070
So the cofactor formula for the
determinant says I should take a

262
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,400
times its cofactor,
which is this b,

263
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,000
plus b times its cofactor,
which is this minus a.

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
OK.
That's what we're doing,
apart from a sign here.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh yeah, so you know,
there might be a minus

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
multiplying everything.

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So if I take this determinant,
it's A -- the determinant of

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
this, the determinant of A
screwed up is a times its

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
cofactor, which is b,
plus the second guy

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
times its cofactor,
which is minus a.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And of course I get the answer
zero, and this is exactly what's

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,930
happening in that,
in that, row times this wrong

273
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,000
column.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
OK.
That's the two by two picture,
and it's just the same here.

275
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,000
That the reason I get a zero up
in there

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
is, the reason I get a zero is
that when I multiply the first

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
row of A and the last row of the
cofactor matrix,

278
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it's as if I'm taking the
determinant of this screwed up

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
matrix that has first and last
rows identical.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The book pins this down more
specific -- and more carefully

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
than I can do in the lecture.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I hope you're seeing the point.

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That this is an identity.

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That it's a beautiful identity
and it tells us what the inverse

285
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
of the matrix is.

286
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So it gives us the inverse,
the formula for the inverse.

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,000
OK.
So that's the first goal of my
lecture, was to find this

288
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,000
formula.
It's done.

289
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,760
OK.

290
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,000
And of course I
could invert,

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
now, I can, I sort of like I
can see what -- I can answer

292
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
questions like this.

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Suppose I have a matrix,
and let me move the one one

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,000
entry.
What happens to the inverse?

295
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Just, just think about that
question.

296
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Suppose I have some
matrix, I just write down some

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
nice, non-singular matrix that's
got an inverse,

298
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and then I move the one one
entry a little bit.

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I add one to it,
for example.

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What happens to the inverse
matrix?

301
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, this formula should tell
me.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I have to look to see what
happens

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
to the determinant and what
happens to all the cofactors.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And, the picture,
it's all there.

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's all there.

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We can really understand how
the inverse changes when the

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
matrix changes.

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,370
OK.

309
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,000
Now my second application is to
-- let me put that over here --

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is to Ax=b.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, the -- course,
the solution is A inverse b.

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But now I have a formula for A
inverse.

313
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A inverse is one over the
determinant times this C

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,760
transpose times B.

315
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,000
I now know what A inverse is.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So now I just have to say,
what have I got here?

317
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is there any way to,
to make this formula,

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
this answer,
which is the one and only

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
answer -- it's the very same
answer we got on the first day

320
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
of the class by elimination.

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now I'm -- now I've got a
formula for the answer.

322
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Can I play with it further to
see what's going on?

323
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And Cramer's,
this Cramer's Rule is

324
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
exactly, that -- a way of
looking at this formula.

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,000
OK.
So this is a formula for x.

326
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,000
Here's my formula.

327
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, of course.

328
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The first thing I see from the
formula is that the answer x

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
always has that in the
determinant.

330
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm not surprised.

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There's a division by the
determinant.

332
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,220
But then I have to say a little
more carefully what's going on

333
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,000
up here.

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And let me tell you what
Cramer's Rule is.

335
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let, let me take x1,
the first component.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So this is the first component
of the answer.

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then there'll be a second
component and a,

338
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
all the other components.

339
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Can I take just the first
component of this formula?

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Well, I certainly have
determinant of A down under.

341
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And what the heck is the first
-- so what do I get in C

342
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
transpose b?

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What's the first entry of C
transpose b?

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's what I have to answer
myself.

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,420
Well, what's the first entry of
C transpose b?

346
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:11,000
OK.

347
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
This B is -- let me tell you
what it is.

348
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,070
Somehow I'm multiplying
cofactors by the entries of B,

349
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,000
right, in this product.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Cofactors from the matrix times
entries of b.

351
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So any time I'm multiplying
cofactors by numbers,

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think, I'm getting the
determinant of something.

353
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And let me call that something
B1.

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So this is a matrix,
the matrix whose determinant is

355
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
coming out of that.

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And we'll,
we'll see what it is.

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
x2 will be the determinant of
some other matrix B2,

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
also divided by determinant of
A.

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So now I just -- Cramer just
had a good idea.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
He realized what matrix it was,
what these B1 and B2 and B3 and

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
so on matrices were.

362
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let me write them on the board
underneath.

363
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,000
OK.
So what is this B1?

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This B1 is the matrix that has
b in its first column and

365
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
otherwise the rest of it is A.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So it otherwise it has the
rest, the, the n-1 columns of A.

367
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's the matrix with -- it's
just the matrix A with column

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
one replaced by the
right-hand side,

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
by the right-hand side b.

370
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Because somehow when I take the
determinant of this guy,

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
it's giving me this matrix
multiplication.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, how could that be?

373
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
How could -- so what's,
what's the determinant formula

374
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,750
I'll use here?

375
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll use cofactors,
of course.

376
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I might as well use
cofactors down column one.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So when I use cofactors down
column one, I'm taking the first

378
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
entry of b times what?

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Times the cofactor c11.

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do you see that?

381
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
When I, when I use cofactors
here, I take the first entry

382
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
here,
B one let's call it,

383
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
times the cofactor there.

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,590
But what's the cofactor in --
my little hand-waving is meant

385
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,000
to indicate that it's a matrix
of one size smaller,

386
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the cofactor.

387
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And it's exactly c11.

388
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well, that's just what we
wanted.

389
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This first entry is c11
times b1.

390
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,240
And then the next entry is
whatever, is c21 times b2,

391
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,000
and so on.

392
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,030
And sure enough,
if I look here,

393
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,000
when I'm, when I do the
cofactor expansion,

394
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
b2 is getting multiplied by the
right thing, and so on.

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So there's Cramer's Rule.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,470
And the book gives another kind
of

397
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:34,000
cute proof without,
without building so much on,

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
on cofactors.

399
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But here we've got cofactors,
so I thought I'd just give you

400
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
this proof.

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So what is B -- in general,
what is Bj?

402
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
This is the,
this is A with column j

403
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
replaced by, by b.

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So that's -- the determinant of
that matrix that you divide by

405
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
determinant of A to get xj.

406
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So x -- let me change this
general formula.

407
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
xj, the j-th one,
is the determinant of Bj

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
divided by the determinant of A.

409
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,640
And now we've said what Bj is.

410
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, so Cramer found a rule.

411
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And we could ask him,
OK, great, good work,

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Cramer.

413
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But is your rule any good in
practice?

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So he says, well,
you couldn't ask about a rule

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
in mine, right,
because it's just -- all you

416
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
have to do is find the
determinant of A and these other

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
determinants,
so I guess -- oh,

418
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
he just says,
well, all you have to do is

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
find n+1 determinants,
the, the n Bs and the A.

420
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And actually,
I remember reading -- there was

421
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
a book, popular book that,
that kids interested in math

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
read when I was a kid
interested in math called

423
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Mathematics for the Million or
something, by a guy named Bell.

424
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And it had a little page about
linear algebra.

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And it said,-- so it explained
elimination in a very

426
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,510
complicated way.

427
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,000
I certainly didn't understand
it.

428
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And, and it made it,
you know, it

429
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
sort of said,
well, there is this formula for

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
elimination, but look at this
great formula,

431
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Cramer's Rule.

432
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So it certainly said Cramer's
Rule was the way to go.

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But actually,
Cramer's Rule is a disastrous

434
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
way to go, because to compute
these

435
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
determinants,
it takes, like,

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
approximately forever.

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So actually I now think of that
book title as being Mathematics

438
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
for the Millionaire,
because you'd have to be able

439
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
to pay for, a hopelessly long
calculation

440
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
where elimination,
of course, produced the x-s,

441
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
in an instant.

442
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But having a formula allows you
to, with, with letters,

443
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
you know, allows you to do
algebra instead of,

444
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
algorithms.

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So the, there's some value in
the Cramer's Rule formula for x

446
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and in the explicit formula
for, for A inverse.

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,420
They're nice formulas,
but I just don't want you to

448
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,390
use them.

449
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,000
That'ss what it comes to.

450
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If you had to -- and Matlab
would never, never do it.

451
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean, it would use
elimination.

452
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,000
OK.
Now I'm ready for number three
in today's list of amazing

453
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
connections coming through the
determinant.

454
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And that number three is the
fact that the determinant gives

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
a volume.
OK.

456
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So now -- so that's my final
topic for -- among these --

457
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
this my number three
application, that the

458
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
determinant is actually equals
the volume of something.

459
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Can I use this little space to
consider a special case,

460
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and then I'll use the far board
to think about the general rule.

461
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So what I going to prove?

462
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Or claim.

463
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I claim that the determinant of
the matrix is the volume of a

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
box.

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
OK, and you say,
which box?

466
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Fair enough.

467
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
OK.

468
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So let's see.

469
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm in -- shall we say we're
in, say three by three?

470
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Shall we suppose -- let's,
let's say three by three.

471
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So, so we can really -- we're,
we're talking about boxes in

472
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
three dimensions,
and three by three matrices.

473
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And so all I do -- you could
guess what the box is.

474
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Here is, here is,
three dimensions.

475
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,000
OK.
Now I take the first row of the
matrix, a11, a22,

476
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
A -- sorry.
a11, a12, a13.

477
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That row is a vector.

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It goes to some point.

479
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That point will be -- and that
edge going to it,

480
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
will be an edge of the box,
and that point will be a corner

481
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
of the box.

482
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So here is zero zero zero,
of course.

483
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And here's the first row of the
matrix: a11, a12,

484
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
a13.

485
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So that's one edge of the box.

486
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Another edge of the box is to
the second row of the matrix,

487
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
row two.

488
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,930
Can I just call it there row
two?

489
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:28,000
And a third row of the box will
be to -- a third row --

490
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
a third edge of the box will be
given by row three.

491
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So, so there's row three.

492
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That, the coordinates,
what are the coordinates of

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
that corner of the box?
a31, a32, a33.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I've got that edge of the
box, that edge of the box,

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
that edge of
the box, and that's all I need.

496
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Now I just finish out the box,
right?

497
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I just -- the proper word,
of course, is parallelepiped.

498
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But for obvious reasons,
I wrote box.

499
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
OK.

500
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, OK.

501
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So there's the,
there's the bottom of the box.

502
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There're the four edge sides of
the box.

503
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There's the top of the box.

504
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Cute, right?

505
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's the box that has these
three edges and then it's

506
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
completed to a,
to a, each, you know,

507
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
each side is a,
is a parallelogram.

508
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And it's that box whose volume
is given by the determinant.

509
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's -- now it's --
possible that the determinant

510
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is negative.

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So we have to just say what's
going on in that case.

512
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If the determinant is negative,
then the volume,

513
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
we, we should take the absolute
value really.

514
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So the volume,
if we, if we think of volume as

515
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
positive, we should take the
absolute value of the

516
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
determinant.

517
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But the, the sign,
what does the sign of the

518
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
determinant -- it always must
tell us something.

519
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And somehow it,
it will tell us whether these

520
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
three is a -- whether it's a
right-handed box or a

521
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
left-handed box.

522
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
If we, if we reversed two of
the

523
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
edges, we would go between a
right-handed box and a

524
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
left-handed box.

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We wouldn't change the volume,
but we would change the,

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
the cyclic, order.

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So I won't worry about that.

528
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And, so one special case is
what?

529
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A equal identity matrix.

530
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,090
So let's take that special
case.

531
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,000
A equal identity matrix.

532
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Is the
formula determinant of identity

533
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
matrix, does that equal the
volume of the box?

534
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, what is the box?

535
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What's the box?

536
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If A is the identity matrix,
then these three rows are the

537
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,250
three coordinate vectors,
and the box is -- it's a cube.

538
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,000
It's the unit cube.

539
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,400
So if, if A is the identity
matrix, of course our formula is

540
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,000
right.

541
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, actually that proves
property one -- that the volume

542
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
has property one.

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Actually, we could,
we could, we could get this

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
thing if we -- if we can show
that the box volume has the same

545
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
three properties that define the
determinant,

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
then it must be the
determinant.

547
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So that's like the,
the, the elegant way to prove

548
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,910
this.

549
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,000
To prove this amazing fact that
the determinant equals the

550
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
volume, first we'll check it for
the identity matrix.

551
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's fine.

552
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The box is a cube and its
volume is one and the

553
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
determinant is one and,
and one agrees with one.

554
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now let me
take one -- let me go up one

555
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
level to an orthogonal matrix.

556
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Because I'd like to take this
chance to bring in chapter --

557
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,060
the, the previous chapter.

558
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,000
Suppose I have an orthogonal
matrix.

559
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What did that mean?

560
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,260
I always called those things Q.

561
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,000
What was the point of --
suppose I

562
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
have, suppose instead of the
identity matrix I'm now going to

563
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
take A equal Q,
an orthogonal matrix.

564
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What was Q then?

565
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That was a matrix whose columns
were orthonormal,

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,690
right?

567
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,000
Those were its columns were
unit vectors,

568
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
perpendicular unit vectors.

569
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So what kind of a box have we
got now?

570
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What kind of a box comes from
the rows or the columns,

571
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't mind,
because the determinant is the

572
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
determinant of the transpose,
so I'm never worried about

573
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that.
What kind of a box,
what shape box have we got if

574
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,000
the matrix is an
orthogonal matrix?

575
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's another cube.

576
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's a cube again.

577
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,410
How is it different from the
identity cube?

578
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,000
It's just rotated.

579
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's just the orthogonal matrix
Q doesn't have to be the

580
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
identity matrix.

581
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's just the unit cube but
turned in space.

582
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So sure enough,
it's the unit cube,

583
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,410
and its volume is one.

584
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,000
Now is the determinant one?

585
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What's the determinant of Q?

586
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We believe that the determinant
of Q better be one or minus one,

587
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
so that our formula is --
checks out in that -- if we

588
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
can't check it in these easy
cases where we got a cube,

589
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
we're not going to get it in
the

590
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
general case.

591
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So why is the determinant of Q
equal one or minus one?

592
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What do we know about Q?

593
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What's the one matrix statement
of the properties of Q?

594
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
A matrix with orthonormal
columns has -- satisfies a

595
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
certain equation.

596
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What, what is that?

597
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's if we
have this orthogonal matrix,

598
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
then the fact -- the way to say
what it, what its properties are

599
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
is this.

600
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Q prime, u- u- Q transpose Q
equals I.

601
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Right?

602
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That's what -- those are the
matrices that get the name Q,

603
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
the matrices that
Q transpose Q is I.

604
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
OK.

605
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Now from that,
tell me why is the determinant

606
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
one or minus one.

607
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
How do I, out of this fact --
this may even be a homework

608
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
problem.

609
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's there in the,
in the list of exercises in the

610
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
book, and let's just do it.

611
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
How do I get,
how do I discover

612
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
that the determinant of Q is
one or maybe minus one?

613
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I take determinants of both
sides, everybody says,

614
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
so I won't -- I take
determinants of both sides.

615
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
On the right-hand side -- so I,
when I take determinants of

616
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
both sides, let me just do it.

617
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Take the determinant of --
take determinants.

618
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Determinant of the identity is
one.

619
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What's the determinant of that
product?

620
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Rule nine is paying off now.

621
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The determinant of a product is
the determinant of this guy --

622
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
maybe I'll put it,
I'll use that symbol for

623
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
determinant.

624
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's the determinant of that
guy

625
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
times the determinant of the
other guy.

626
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And then what's the determinant
of Q transpose?

627
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's the same as the
determinant of Q.

628
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Rule ten pays off.

629
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So this is just this thing
squared.

630
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So that determinant squared is
one and sure enough it's one or

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
minus one.

632
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Great.
So in these special cases of
cubes,

633
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we really do have determinant
equals volume.

634
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Now can I just push that to
non-cubes.

635
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Let me push it first to
rectangles, rectangular boxes,

636
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
where I'm just multiplying the
e- the edges are -- let me keep

637
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
all the ninety degree angles,
because those are -- that,

638
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that makes my life easy.

639
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And just stretch the edges.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Suppose I stretch that first
edge, suppose this first edge I

641
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
double.

642
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Suppose I double that first
edge, keeping the other edges

643
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
the same.

644
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
What happens to the volume?

645
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It doubles, right?

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We know that the volume of a
cube doubles.

647
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
In fact, because we know that
the

648
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
new cube would sit right on top
-- I mean, the new,

649
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the added cube would sit right
on -- would fit -- probably a

650
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
geometer would say congruent or
something -- would go right in,

651
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
in the other.

652
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We'd have two.

653
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We have two identical cubes.

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Total volume is now two.

655
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
OK.

656
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So I want -- if I double an
edge, the volume doubles.

657
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What happens to the
determinant?

658
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,750
If I double,
the first row of a matrix,

659
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:17,000
what ch- ch- what's the effect
on the determinant?

660
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It also doubles,
right?

661
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And that was rule number 3a.

662
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Remember rule 3a was that if I,
I could, if I had a factor in,

663
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in row one, T,
I could factor it out.

664
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So if, if I have a factor two
in that row one,

665
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I can factor it out of the
determinant.

666
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It agrees with the -- the
volume of the box has that

667
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
factor two.

668
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So, so volume satisfies this
property 3a.

669
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And now I really close,
but I -- but to get to the very

670
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
end of this proof,
I have to get away from right

671
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,000
angles.
I have to allow the possibility
of, other angles.

672
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,710
And -- or what's saying the
same thing, I have to check that

673
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,000
the volume also satisfies 3b.

674
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So can I --
This is end of proof that the

675
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
-- so I'm -- determinant of A
equals volume of box,

676
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and where I right now?

677
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,250
This volume has properties,
properties one,

678
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,000
no problem.

679
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If the box is the cube,
everything is -- if the box is

680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the unit cube,
its volume is one.

681
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Property two was if I reverse
two rows, but that doesn't

682
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
change the box.

683
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And it doesn't change the
absolute value,

684
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
so no problem there.

685
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Property 3a was if I mul- you
remember what 3a was?

686
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,530
So property one was about the
identity matrix.

687
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,340
Property two was about a plus
or minus sign that I don't care

688
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,000
about.

689
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Property 3a was a factor T in a
row.

690
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But now I've got property three
B to deal with.

691
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
What was property 3b?

692
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is a great way to review
these, properties.

693
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So that 3b, the property 3b
said -- let's do,

694
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
let's do two by two.

695
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So said that if I had a+a',
b+b', c, d that this equaled

696
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,130
what?

697
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,000
So this is property 3b.

698
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This is the linearity in row
one by itself.

699
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So c d is staying the same,
and I can split this into a b

700
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and a' b'.

701
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's property 3b,
at least in the two by two

702
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
case.

703
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And what I -- I wanted now to
show that the volume,

704
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
which two, two by two,
that means area,

705
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
has this, has this property.

706
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Let me just emphasize that we
have got -- we're getting --

707
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this is a formula,
then, for the area of a

708
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
parallelogram.

709
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The area of this parallelogram
-- can I just draw it?

710
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
OK, here's the,
here's the parallelogram.

711
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I have the row a b.

712
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's the first row.

713
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's the point a b.

714
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And I tack on c d.
c d, coming out of here.

715
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I complete the
parallelogram.

716
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So this is -- well,
I better make it look right.

717
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,710
It's really this one that has
coordinates c d and this has

718
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,000
coordinates -- well,
whatever the sum is.

719
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And of course starting at zero
zero.

720
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So we all know,
this is a+c,

721
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
b+d.

722
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Rather than -- I'm pausing on
that proof for a minute just to

723
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
going back to our formula.

724
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Because I want you to see that
unlike Cramer's Rule,

725
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,290
that I wasn't that impressed
by, I'm very impressed by this

726
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,000
formula for the area of a
parallelogram.

727
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And what's our formula?

728
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,460
What,
what's the area of that

729
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,000
parallelogram?

730
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If I had asked you that last
year, you would have said OK,

731
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the area of a parallelogram is
the base times the height,

732
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000
right?
So you would have figured out
what this base,

733
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,240
the -- how long that base was.

734
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,000
It's like the square root of A
squared plus b squared.

735
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And then you would have figured
out how much is this height,

736
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
whatever it is.

737
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's horrible.

738
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This, I mean,
we got square roots,

739
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,700
and in that height there would
be other revolting stuff.

740
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:40,000
But now what's the formula that
we now know for the area?

741
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's the determinant of our
little matrix.

742
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's just ad-bc.

743
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No square roots.

744
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Totally rememberable,
because it's exactly a formula

745
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
that we've been studying the
whole, for three lectures.

746
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
OK.

747
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That's, you know,
that's the most important point

748
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm making here.

749
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,310
Is that if you know the
coordinates of a box,

750
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,000
of the corners,
then you have a great formula

751
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
for the volume,
area or volume,

752
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that doesn't involve any
lengths or any angles or any

753
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
heights, but just involves the
coordinates that you've got.

754
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And similarly,
what's the area of this

755
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
triangle?

756
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Suppose I chop that off and say
what about -- because you might

757
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
often be interested in a
triangle instead of a

758
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
parallelogram.

759
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
What's the area of this
triangle?

760
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Now there again,
everybody would have said the

761
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
area of a triangle is
half the base times the height.

762
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And in some cases,
if you know the base that a,

763
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
that's -- and the height,
that's fine.

764
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But here, we,
what we know is the coordinates

765
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
of the corners.

766
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
We know the vertices.

767
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And so what's the area of that
triangle?

768
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
If I know these,
if I know a b,

769
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
c d, and zero zero,
what's the area?

770
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's just half,
so it's just half of this.

771
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So this is, this is a- a b -- a
d - b c for the parallelogram

772
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and one half of that,
one half of ad-bc for the

773
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
triangle.

774
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So I mean,
this is a totally trivial

775
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
remark, to say,
well, divide by two.

776
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But it's just that you more
often see triangles,

777
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and you feel you know the
formula for the area but the

778
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
good formula for the area is
this one.

779
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,970
And I'm just going to -- I'm
just going to say one more thing

780
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,000
about the area of a triangle.

781
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's just because it's -- you
know, it's so great to have a

782
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
good formula for something.

783
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
What if our triangle did not
start at zero zero?

784
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
What if our triangle,
what if we had this -- what if

785
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
we had -- so I'm coming back to
triangles again.

786
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But let me, let me put this
triangle somewhere,

787
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
it's -- I'm staying with
triangles, I'm just in two

788
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
dimensions, but I'm going to
allow you to give me any three

789
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
corners.

790
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And in -- those six numbers
must determine the area.

791
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And what's the formula?

792
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The area is going to be,
it's going to be,

793
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
there'll be that
half of a parallelogram.

794
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,680
I mean, basically this can't be
completely new,

795
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,000
right?

796
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We've got the area when -- we,
we know the area when this is

797
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
zero zero.

798
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Now we just want to lift our
sight slightly and get the area

799
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
when all th- so let me write
down what it,

800
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
what it comes out to be.

801
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It turns out that if you do
this, x1 y1 and a 1,

802
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
x2 y2 and a 1,
x3 y3 and a 1,

803
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,730
that that works.

804
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,000
That the determinant symbol,
of course.

805
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,040
It's just -- if I gave you that
determinant to find,

806
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,000
you might subtract this row
from

807
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
this.

808
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It would kill that one.

809
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Subtract this row from this,
it would kill that one.

810
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,460
Then you'd have a simple
determinant to do with

811
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,000
differences, and it would --
this little subtraction,

812
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
what I did was equivalent to
moving the triangle to start at

813
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the origin.

814
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I did it fast,
because time is up.

815
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And I didn't complete that
proof of 3b.

816
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'll leave -- the book has a
carefully drawn figure to show

817
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
why that works.

818
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But I hope you saw the main
point is that for area and

819
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
volume, determinant gives a
great formula.

820
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000
OK.
And
next lectures are about

821
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
eigenvalues, so we're really
into the big stuff.

822
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Thanks.
