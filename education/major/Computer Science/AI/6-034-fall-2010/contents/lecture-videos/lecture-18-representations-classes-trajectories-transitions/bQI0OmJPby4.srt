1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,220


2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,340
PATRICK WINSTON: We might wonder
a little bit about the

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,540
nature of human intelligence,
and we might reflect a little

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,230
bit on the kind of intelligence
we've been

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,310
talking about in the
past few weeks.

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,160
It's been an intelligence
of sorts.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,980
Those programs, support vector
machines, boosting, they can

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,030
do really smart things.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,710
But the peculiar thing about
systems that use those methods

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,770
is that those systems don't
have any idea about what

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,260
they're doing.

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,380
They don't know anything.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,810
So they don't give us very much
of an insight into the

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,720
nature of human intelligence.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,500
And, after all, I'd like to
have a model of human

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
intelligence because, let's face
it, we're the smartest

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,830
things around.

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,760
So there are lots of ways to
approach that question.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,090
And we'll approach that
question first from a

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,560
evolutionary point of view.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,990
Some scientists believe, me for
instance, that we have a

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:26,280
family tree that looks
about like this.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,110


24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,970
Too small to see much of that,
but the main point is that we

25
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,360
haven't been around very long.

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,470
We humans have been around maybe
200,000 years, and the

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,030
dinosaurs died out 60
million years ago.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,890
So in the blink of an eye, we
seem to have, more or less,

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,500
taken over.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,590
When you look at that family
tree on a scale where you can

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,960
see it, one of the
characteristics is increasing

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,210
brain size.

33
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,380


34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,980
There we are on the left,
chimpanzee on the right.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,300
Clearly, mostly mouth, not
to much brain in there.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,040
That one down below is a
reconstruction of one of those

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,380
pithecus type bipedal apes
from about 4 million

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,680
years ago or so.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,770
So we became bipedal a
long time before we

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,810
had much of a brain.

41
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,980
So you might think, well, maybe
brain size has a lot to

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,079
do with it, and I
suppose it does.

43
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:40,700
So we can plot brain volume of
our ancestors versus time.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,950
So the picture I just showed you
was from about 3 million

45
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,740
years ago, I guess.

46
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,530
And then on the upper right hand
corner, oh, that's not

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,500
just us, that's also
the Neanderthals.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,750
Their brains might have been
slightly bigger than ours.

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,020
So it isn't just brain size.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,660
Here's what that
guy looks like.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,930
That's a Neanderthal, of
course, on the left.

52
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,680
And that's one of
us on the right.

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,630
Some conspicuous differences,
big heads, the rib cage is

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,130
kind of conical in shape,
a large pelvis.

55
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,670
People like to make a lot of
speculations about how they

56
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,031
must have moved around.

57
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:26,062
But one thing is plain, they
didn't amount to much.

58
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:29,300
They could make stone tools, but
those stone tools didn't

59
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,170
change much over tens of
thousands of years.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,240
And that was pretty much the
story with us too, until

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,400
something happened, probably in
southern Africa, probably

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,500
in a group of individuals,
maybe less than 1,000.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,520
And what's the evidence
for that?

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,840
The evidence for that
is mostly--

65
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,420
comes from DNA studies with
a lot of probabilistic

66
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,850
assumptions, and Monte Carlo
simulations, but it seems

67
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,640
among the competing hypothesis
for how we came to populate

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,290
the world, it seems that there
was a group of us, homo

69
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,820
sapiens, in Southern Africa that
got something that nobody

70
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,920
else had and the highest
probability scenario is that

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,870
we quickly took over.

72
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,560
That population of homo sapiens
dominated the rest,

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,970
went out of Africa, and within
the blink of an eye did that

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,220
sort of stuff.

75
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,300


76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,330
What's that sort of stuff?

77
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,120
Those two paintings are
from Lascaux about

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,190
25,000 years ago.

79
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,870
Paleoanthropologists, like
Tattersall, take that as plain

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,190
evidence that there was symbolic
thought on the people

81
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,710
who were around at that
time, us homo sapiens.

82
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,120
The head is a carving of a
mastodon tusk of a woman

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,110
25,000 years ago.

84
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,750
Also, plainly symbolic, people
are making a lot of jewelry

85
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,860
and doing self adornment.

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,130
The Neanderthals never
seemed to do that.

87
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,180
That jewelry making seems to
have gone back to Southern

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,410
Africa, maybe 70,000
years ago.

89
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,060
People were puncturing seashells
and using them as

90
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,990
necklaces, apparently.

91
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,350
So something happened, and the
paleoanthropologists, who

92
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,110
write fascinating stuff, don't
quite know how to talk about

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,360
it other than to say
it looks like we

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,820
became somehow symbolic.

95
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,780
And somehow that has something
to do with language.

96
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,280
So if you talk to Noam
Chomsky he will say--

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,020
let me get this precise,
this is near his

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,450
quotation as I can get.

99
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,920
He thinks it was the ability to
take two concepts and put

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,400
them together to form a third
concept without disturbing the

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,850
original concepts and without
limit, and each

102
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,030
part of that's important.

103
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,100
The without limit part is what
separates us from species that

104
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,659
might be able to do that a
little bit, but we can do it

105
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,210
without any apparent limit.

106
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,760
So that's a linguist speaking.

107
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,910
He talks a lot about the
merge operation, and

108
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,080
combinators and language--

109
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
using terms foreign to us.

110
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,550
Better not use the term
"combinator," it's kind of a

111
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,810
computer science term.

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,210
But whatever it is, it seemed
to happen about that time.

113
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,980
It didn't happen slowly and
proportion to brain size, it

114
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,460
seemed to happen all of a sudden
in consequence of a

115
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,520
brain that had grown big enough
to be an enablement but

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,480
the capability was
not what pulled

117
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,710
evolution in that direction.

118
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,000
So, I believe, that whatever
that was, that capability,

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,540
enabled humans, us humans, to
tell and understand stories,

120
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,150
and that's what separates us
from the other primates.

121
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,300
That ability to--

122
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,280
The symbolic ability, whatever
it is, enabled storytelling

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,070
and understanding.

124
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,770
And that's what all education
is about and that's why our

125
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,880
species is special.

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,830
So what we're going to talk
about today is something you

127
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,720
might think of as an
instantiation of that

128
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,740
hypothesis, one way of
thinking about it.

129
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,920
And it's a way of thinking about
what the linguists would

130
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,090
call the inner language.

131
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,240
It's not the language with which
we communicate, it's the

132
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,660
language with which we think,
which is closely related to

133
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,840
the language with which we
communicate, but may not be

134
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,090
quite the same thing.

135
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,900
So many of you are bilingual.

136
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,200
Chris is bilingual.

137
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,640
Chris, have you ever had the
experience of remembering that

138
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,860
someone said something to you,
but not remembering what

139
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,658
language they used?

140
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:37,908
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

141
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:42,450


142
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,250
PATRICK WINSTON: How about
[? you, Sian, ?] have you had

143
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,677
that experience?

144
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:45,870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

145
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,420
PATRICK WINSTON: What?

146
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,670
STUDENT: I always [INAUDIBLE].

147
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,121


148
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,490
PATRICK WINSTON: [INAUDIBLE]
experience of having--

149
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,010
David, have you ever had that
experience of remembering some

150
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,140
conversation but not remembering
the language in

151
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,659
which it was cast?

152
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,046
STUDENT: Well, you remember
something you usually don't

153
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,894
know which language
it was in anyway.

154
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,880
PATRICK WINSTON: You usually
don't remember.

155
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
That's a common view.

156
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,110
You remember something was
said, that there was a

157
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,640
conversation that had some
content, but if it's with a

158
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,250
speaker of your own language and
your embedded in another

159
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,340
place, you often don't remember
what language the

160
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,110
conversation was in.

161
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,500
Is that right, [? Wana, ?] you
remember things like that?

162
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,912
Not sure?

163
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,941
STUDENT: People who [INAUDIBLE]
speak in a certain

164
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,520
language, so--

165
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,060
PATRICK WINSTON: Sometimes you
don't have that confusion, she

166
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,400
says, because you always speak
to particular people in a

167
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,330
particular language.

168
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,169
But many people report that they
have that experience of

169
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,289
not remembering which language
something was said in.

170
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,590
Well, OK, so what are
we going to do?

171
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,610
We need an inner language, and
maybe we can start just by

172
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,690
saying, let's have something
that looks sort

173
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,980
of familiar to us.

174
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,290
We have an object and it's
supported by some other

175
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,960
objects, so those are
support relations.

176
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,680


177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,850
That's one example of what we
might call a semantic net.

178
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,940
It's a network that's got nodes
and links, it's got--

179
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,640
it has some meaning.

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,790
That's where the word "semantic"
comes from.

181
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,760
Well, we might have another
example that looks like this.

182
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:30,640
There's Macbeth, there's Duncan,
and Macbeth murders

183
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:39,870
Duncan, then we also know,
somehow, there's a kill

184
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,720
involved as a consequence,
and then ultimately,

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,300
Duncan has a property.

186
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:53,500


187
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,870
And that property is the
property of being dead.

188
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,460


189
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,530
So there's another semantic net
recording something that

190
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,030
happens in Shakespeare's
Macbeth plot.

191
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,880
Now, we can decorate
that a little bit.

192
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,200
So as to get a couple of
other concepts in play.

193
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,090
First of all, the thing we've
got already is we've got

194
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,340
combinators.

195
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:22,520


196
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,770
Then combinators.

197
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,570


198
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,590
Well, a fancy name for those
links that connect the nodes.

199
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,410
Another thing we've got is an
opportunity for connecting the

200
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,370
links themselves.

201
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,920
So the murder sort of implies
the kill, and the kill leads

202
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,170
us to conclude that the
victim is dead.

203
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,720
So that is treating the links
themselves as objects that can

204
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
be the subject or object
of other links.

205
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:04,630
So we call that process
"reification."

206
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,100
Now, in artificial intelligence,
semantic nets

207
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,460
we're all over the early work,
but if you have a big network

208
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,780
that covers the wall you need
some way of putting a

209
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,810
spotlight on some
pieces of it.

210
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,580
So Marvin Minsky put a lot of
technical content into that

211
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,830
idea and created
the notion of--

212
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,210
a notion that deserves
another color here--

213
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,850
he suggested that we need a
localization process, so we

214
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,110
have frames, so-called
frames or templates.

215
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,340
And a frame for this murder
action might be that there's a

216
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:51,450
murder frame that has an agent
and has a victim, and the

217
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:59,650
agent is Macbeth, and the
victim is Duncan.

218
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,950


219
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:13,780
So that's a way of putting a
localization layer on top of

220
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,230
what we've got so far.

221
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,900
Later on, I'll add sequence
to that list.

222
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,820
So this is where it rested for
a long time, and in some

223
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,300
sense, still rests there because
as soon as you've got

224
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,110
combinators, you've
got something

225
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,690
that's pretty much universal.

226
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,690
You can do anything with it.

227
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,060
The trouble is it's sort of
down at the bit level.

228
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,390
It's like assembly code.

229
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,230
It doesn't have, as a concept,
enough organization to help

230
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,360
you go to the next level
of achievement.

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,760
There's also a little problem
here that deserves also, some

232
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,770
mention, and that is that we
have, over this whole thing,

233
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,265
the problem of parasitic
semantics.

234
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:05,910


235
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,695
Parasitic semantics.

236
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:15,318


237
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:18,320
A kind of ugliness that
surrounds this whole concept

238
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
because when we look at a
diagram like that, and we say,

239
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,260
oh, Macbeth murdered
Duncan, that means

240
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,880
Duncan's the victim.

241
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,720
We know there must have been a
motive, maybe Macbeth wanted

242
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,190
to be king.

243
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,810
Well, we know all that stuff,
and there's a tendency to

244
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,530
project that knowing
into the machine.

245
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,920
If you're going to play with
your telephone, please leave.

246
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,670


247
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:51,870
So if we project meaning into
that that's our understanding

248
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,750
that's not the machine's
understanding.

249
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,815
So much of the meaning can
be said to be parasitic.

250
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:58,700


251
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,740
We're the parasite, and
we're projecting

252
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,325
the into that thing.

253
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,110
Putting that diagram into some
machine form doesn't mean the

254
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,710
machine knows anything.

255
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,140
It might be able to conclude
some things, but it's

256
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,300
understanding is not grounded
in any kind of contact with

257
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,880
the physical world.

258
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,310
So we have to worry a lot
about that and where

259
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,460
philosophers would stop there
and go off and write a few

260
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,340
books on the subject.

261
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,470
But we're not philosophers so
we're going to just mention

262
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,700
the problem and go
barreling ahead.

263
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,220
So we need to use this notion
of semantic net, and we have

264
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,200
to ask ourselves some questions
about what elements

265
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,660
of the inner language are most
useful and yet it might be

266
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,960
very complicated, but here's
usefulness number one.

267
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,330
The notion of classification.

268
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,660
So we know about stuff,
and we know about,

269
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,055
for example, pianos.

270
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:52,620


271
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,055
And we know about tools.

272
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:57,160


273
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,300
And we know about maps.

274
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,010
But we know about those things
on different levels.

275
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,120
So say I'm thinking about a
tool, do you have a very good

276
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,960
image of what I'm
talking about?

277
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,690
The answer has to be no because
the notion of a tool

278
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,960
is very vague, so it's hard
to form a picture of

279
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,360
what that's all about.

280
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
On the other hand, if I said
I'm thinking about a mac.

281
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,990
Well, this is interesting
because there's lexical

282
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,670
ambiguity there.

283
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,970
You don't know if I'm talking
about the Apple type Mac or

284
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,400
the apple type Mac, or
should I say the

285
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,800
fruit or the computer?

286
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,660
So there's lexical ambiguity
there at two levels or more.

287
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,260
But let's fill this
in a little bit.

288
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,010
If I know I'm talking about a
piano, you can form a picture

289
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,100
of that so that seems to be on
a more detailed level where

290
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,750
you can do hallucination.

291
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,720
At a higher level you have just
a musical instrument.

292
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,730


293
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,210
And I can give you a tool to
think about by writing hammer.

294
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,260


295
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,060
And if I'm going to
have a mac, it's

296
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,890
going to be an apple.

297
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,480
And in this case, I want you
to think about a fruit.

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,650
And down here, I can be
more specific about

299
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,850
these things too.

300
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,330
I can add a slight refinement
of detail and say, I'm

301
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,723
thinking about one of these.

302
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,014
Do you know what this is?

303
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:29,490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

304
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,070
PATRICK WINSTON: No, it's not
a mere hammer, it's a

305
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,590
ball-peen hammer.

306
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,290
In some circles, it's called
a ladies hammer.

307
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't know why.

308
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,050
But it's--

309
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,580
What's it for?

310
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,420
Most people buy it mostly
because it's

311
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,060
small and light weight.

312
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,570
But, in fact, it's for
metal working.

313
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,810
It's for taking a piece of sheet
metal and pounding it

314
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,630
out into an ashtray
or something

315
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,870
or for seating rivets.

316
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,530
It's a metal worker's hammer.

317
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,450
So you might not have known
about that before but now, at

318
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,300
least, you have a word to
hang that knowledge on.

319
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,620
It's a ball peen hammer.

320
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,010


321
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,059
So we have various levels here,
going from very specific

322
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,800
to very general.

323
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,520
And we can even go to a level
of specificity for pianos by

324
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,770
saying we've got
a Bosendorfer.

325
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:23,430


326
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,680
Why is a Bosendorfer special?

327
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,950


328
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,240
I mean, is it like a Baldwin?

329
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,010
Something's [INAUDIBLE],
Yoka--

330
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,150


331
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,710
Lots of piano types,
what's special?

332
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,110
You see, you don't know because
unless you play the

333
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,290
piano, and probably unless
you're a serious piano player

334
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,082
you don't know that
a Bosendorfer--

335
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,658
Ariel, you know.

336
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,950
STUDENT: I think its supposed to
have an extra octave at the

337
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,610
bottom, black keys.

338
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,600
Pretty cool.

339
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,580
PATRICK WINSTON: It's got some
extra keys at the bottom.

340
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,240
And most people don't know that
unless they're serious

341
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,350
about the piano.

342
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,160
Some professional piano
players, when they're

343
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,110
confronted with a Bosendorfer
have to have someone cover

344
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,790
those keys because it screws
up their peripheral vision,

345
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,420
and hit the wrong key.

346
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,410
Because they're not used
to having those

347
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,780
extra keys at the bottom.

348
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,365
So that's a little detail
but the Bosendorfer.

349
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,470
So you can make a kind of graph,
and you can say, let's

350
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:31,140
go from low, very general,
to a basic level,

351
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,580
to a specific level.

352
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,170


353
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,550
So it is the case in human
knowledge that that graph has

354
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,920
a tendency to look sort
of like this.

355
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,030


356
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,650
So here's tool, here's hammer,
here's ball peen.

357
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,540
So that level, where you have a
big jump, that's the general

358
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,840
to basic level of transition.

359
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,580


360
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,070
So that basic level is probably
there because that's

361
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,090
the level on which we hang a
huge amount of our knowledge.

362
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,200
We know a lot about pianos, and
it all seems to be hanging

363
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,070
on that word piano,
which gives us

364
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,980
power with the concept.

365
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,680
So that's example number
one of an element

366
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,600
of our inner language.

367
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,860
The ability to assemble things
into hierarchies like that,

368
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,740
and hang knowledge about those
objects on the elements in

369
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,990
that hierarchy.

370
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,220


371
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,790
Well, given that you have
elements in the hierarchy, how

372
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,650
do you talk about them?

373
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,740
Well, I like to consider the
possibility, just for the sake

374
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,750
of illustration, that you're
thinking about a car crashing

375
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
into a wall.

376
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,220
So you've got things to think
about like the speed of the

377
00:19:50,220 --> 00:20:04,705
car, the distance to the wall,
and the condition of the car.

378
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:08,790


379
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,110
And you've got the period before
the crash, during the

380
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,650
crash, and after the crash.

381
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,390
So you might want to think about
how to talk about those

382
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,725
objects in those three
time periods.

383
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:23,790


384
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,410
So we can do that with a
vocabulary of change and we do

385
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,400
that because we believe that
most of human thinking is

386
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
thinking about change
causing change.

387
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,070
And that flies in the face of
what we learned as engineers.

388
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,995
Because in engineering, we learn
about state, and once

389
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,900
you know the state of the
system, you know everything

390
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,020
you need to know in order
to predict the future.

391
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,640
The trouble is, in our heads,
thinking about everything

392
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,007
there is in the world, including
the current phase of

393
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,530
the moon, is too much stuff.

394
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,950
So mostly, our thinking, we
think, is hinging on the idea

395
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,530
that change leads to change.

396
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,620
So that's why we have a
vocabulary of change.

397
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,460
So in the period before the
crash, the speed of the car is

398
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,090
not changing.

399
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,600
There's a little notation for
not change, no delta.

400
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,790
The distance to the wall,
that's decreasing.

401
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,370
The condition of the car,
that's not changing.

402
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,210
Then, the car hits the wall.

403
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,810
So the speed of the car
disappears, the distance to

404
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,950
the wall disappears, and the
condition of the car will

405
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,010
change dramatically.

406
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,110
Finally, after the crash is
over, the speed of the car

407
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,740
does not appear.

408
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,520
The distance to the wall does
not change, and the condition

409
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,550
of the car also does
not change.

410
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,020
So that's hinting at a
vocabulary of change, and its

411
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,470
use, which will be the second
element in our development of

412
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,950
a vocabulary of ways in which we
might have constructed are

413
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,700
inner language.

414
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,800
So this a particular idea,
that's classification.

415
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,930
This is transition, and a
system that purports to

416
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,850
understand stories with a heavy
emphasis on this notion

417
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,450
of transition and we believe,
that is to say, I think, that

418
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,880
that vocabulary has to have
decrease, increase, change,

419
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,000
appear, and disappear.

420
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,910
So there are 10 things you can
have in such diagrams.

421
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,070
I've done five.

422
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:47,110
That's because, for each
of those, there's a not

423
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,070
variation on that.

424
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,270
So with a vocabulary of 10
things can go a long way

425
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,250
toward helping to describe
things that are in process of

426
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,980
change and making transition.

427
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,200
And we have a lot of those
words in our vocabulary.

428
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,680
We use those words a lot
in our vocabulary.

429
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,380
They seem heavily connected
with vision.

430
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,700
Our friend appeared.

431
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,580
The cat disappeared.

432
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,910
The speed increased.

433
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,675
So this is a description
of a crash.

434
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:16,090


435
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,430
In terms of those kinds of
elements, now, I say to you,

436
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,410
how does a camera work?

437
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:31,160
Well, I could say the camera
works because a photon crashes

438
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,410
into a photo receptor.

439
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,700


440
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,450
So when I say a photon crashes
into a photo receptors, why am

441
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,230
I saying that, and
how does it help?

442
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,890
I'm saying that and it helps
because it's the same pattern

443
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,390
of change you already know about
when you talk about a

444
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,560
car crashing into a wall.

445
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,180
How does that work?

446
00:23:50,180 --> 00:24:03,790
The speed of the photon, the
distance of the photon to the

447
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,470
receptor, and the condition
of the receptor.

448
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,680


449
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,720
So analogies like that are very
much of the core of what

450
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,700
we think about all the time.

451
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,630
Really then, there is
representation number two.

452
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,040
Number one is class, number two
is transition, and now,

453
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,600
you're ready for number three,
which is trajectory.

454
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,960
Linguists, who study sentences,
often talk in terms

455
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,430
of fundamental patterns that
seemed to be in a lot of what

456
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,670
we say, and a lot of what we
say is about objects moving

457
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,920
along trajectories.

458
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,520


459
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,375
So we can talk about
a trajectory frame.

460
00:24:51,375 --> 00:25:00,680


461
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,650
And a trajectory frame will
have elements like this.

462
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,750
It has an object moving on a
trajectory that ends up at a

463
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,000
destination.

464
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000


465
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,715
You might start out
at a source.

466
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:16,450


467
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,970
It's probably been arranged by
some kind of agent, and the

468
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,840
agent may assist himself making
the motion happen with

469
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,090
some kind of instrument.

470
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,700


471
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,300
There might be somebody
helping out

472
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,030
over here, a co-agent.

473
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,490


474
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,620
Well, what else can we have?

475
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,235
A beneficiary, someone is helped
out by the action.

476
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:55,570


477
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,240
Sometimes, the motion is
arranged by a conveyance.

478
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,450


479
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:12,180
So these are a lot of slots,
finite slots, and descriptions

480
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,460
of actions, many of which
involve motion on a

481
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,300
trajectory.

482
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,650
We have a tendency in language
to decorate these things in

483
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,540
one way or another, depending
on the language.

484
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,690
And so in many languages, the
decoration is by way of

485
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,350
position in the sentence.

486
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,400
In English, it's often by
way of a preposition.

487
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:39,430
It's used to help zero in on a
particular role of an object

488
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,550
in the trajectory scenario.

489
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:49,110
So if I say, I baked a cake with
a friend, there's a with

490
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,040
preposition.

491
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,750
If I baked a cake for a friend,
the friend is the

492
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,160
beneficiary.

493
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,390
If I baked a cake with an oven,
that's an instrument.

494
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:08,480
The object may be moving to a
destination from a source, and

495
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,460
if I'm going to New York
by train, I put a

496
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,080
by on top of that.

497
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,290
If the agent isn't in subject
position, I would say

498
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,700
something like, oh,
I see all the work

499
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,520
was done by a student.

500
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,950
So those prepositions have a
tendency to help us zoom in on

501
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,130
the actual role of particular
objects in this whole package,

502
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,630
the whole frame.

503
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,300
So this is number three.

504
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,320


505
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,490
There's a variation on this
in which there's no actual

506
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,930
trajectory in which case we'll
just call that a role frame.

507
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,780
Because if there's no
trajectory, we can still have

508
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,915
things such as an instrument, a
co-agent, and a beneficiary.

509
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:47,450


510
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,120
So now, we've got three
representations.

511
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,410
You might say, well,
what good are they?

512
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,680
And you can determine what
good they are these days

513
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,460
because it's easier to go over
established corpuses, and say,

514
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,700
what fraction of those, of the
sentences, in such a corpus

515
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,660
involve classification or a
transition or a trajectory.

516
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,170
The most well known of these is
the so-called Wall Street

517
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,810
Journal Corpus.

518
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,790
It has 50,000 sentences in it,
drawn from some period of

519
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:22,700
time, all the syntactical
language types work with that

520
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,530
corpus a great deal.

521
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,570
And we worked with it a little
bit too, to see what fraction

522
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,210
of the sentences or what the
density of trajectories and

523
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,170
transitions are in
those sentences.

524
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,010
So I have to say that a little
more carefully, because the

525
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:48,730
finding is that in 100 sentences
you'll find about 25

526
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,120
transitions or trajectories.

527
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,590
So they're very densely
represented.

528
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,270
They're often very abstract.

529
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:05,470
Prices rose, the economy went
to someplace, but there are

530
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,100
still words that denote
transition or trajectory.

531
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,660


532
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,800
Of course, once you have all
this stuff, that you have then

533
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,110
have a desire to put
it together.

534
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,810
So the next thing we need to
talk about is story sequences.

535
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:27,200
So a story sequence can be a
single sentence, and I want to

536
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,135
illustrate that with one
of my favorites.

537
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:35,050


538
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,300
Here's the sentences.

539
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:48,220


540
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,915
I think I've chosen a gender
neutral name so as not getting

541
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,270
in any trouble.

542
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,600
So Pat, but I don't call myself
Pat because I decided

543
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,570
when I was 18 years old
that pat is a unit

544
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,470
of measure for butter.

545
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,550
In any case, with Pat comforted,
Mary, do you have

546
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,100
an image of what happened?

547
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,940
Probably not a very
firm image.

548
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,520
You know that Pat did something,
but you don't know

549
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,790
exactly what.

550
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,150
Nevertheless, when Pat comforted
Chris, you can

551
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,000
construct something that looks
like a role frame.

552
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,930
Because the role frame for that
would have an agent, and

553
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,840
that would be Pat.

554
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,090
There's an action.

555
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,740


556
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,760
We're going to put a question
mark in there because we don't

557
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,760
have a very firm image of
what the action is.

558
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,190
Then again, we're building
a wall frame, like so.

559
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,440
The object is Chris.

560
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,230


561
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,140
Oh, you know that
is the object.

562
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:08,160


563
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,710
Is there anything
else we can say?

564
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,820
Oh, yes, we can probably
say something more.

565
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,630
Something else comes to
mind when you see

566
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,910
Pat comforted Chris.

567
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:23,120
There's a sort of result,
and the result is

568
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,370
a transition frame.

569
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,515


570
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:36,370
And the transition frame
involves an object, which is

571
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:50,570
Chris, and Chris has a mood,
which presumably, is improved.

572
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,460
It goes up.

573
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,855
Did you have something,
Elliott?

574
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:58,320
STUDENT: Could you, I guess,
analogize the Pat comforted

575
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,260
Chris to something like Pat gave
comfort to Chris as Chris

576
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,240
is the destination?

577
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,715
And couldn't this
be [INAUDIBLE]?

578
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:11,550
PATRICK WINSTON: Elliott is
wandering into a very

579
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,250
interesting area having to do
with, couldn't you think about

580
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,860
this in another way and think
of it as something moving

581
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,230
along a trajectory.

582
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,600
Comfort is moving, if not from
Pat, at least to Chris.

583
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,610
And that's a very important kind
of observation because

584
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,220
what it would suggest is there
can be a utility in thinking

585
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,300
of things in multiple ways,
multiple representations.

586
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,040
Marvin Minsky has a wonderful
aphoristic phrase, which is,

587
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,700
if you can only think about
something in one way, you have

588
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,160
no recourse when
you get stuck.

589
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,630
So multiple representations mean
you have multiple ways of

590
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,340
gathering regularity from the
world, and collecting it and

591
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,250
therefore that'll make
you smarter.

592
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,080
So yes, you could do that, and
that would be a compliment to

593
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,020
what I'm doing now.

594
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,490
Let me continue what
I'm doing now.

595
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,780
So what have I done?

596
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,720
I've got a role frame and a
tradition frame, and the

597
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,550
transition frame is the
target of the result

598
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,350
slot in the role frame.

599
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,110


600
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,230
Now, we can modify this
a little bit.

601
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,440


602
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,060
And maybe want to say, instead
of comforted, terrorized.

603
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:30,840


604
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,490
And how would that
change things?

605
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,490
We don't know exactly
what Pat did so the

606
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,180
action remains unknown.

607
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,670
The agent and the object
are the same.

608
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,010
But the result here
is presumably that

609
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,590
the mood went down.

610
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,550
With just what we've got so far,
we can answer a lot of

611
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,460
questions, by the way.

612
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,010
Once we've got the sentence
understood in these terms, we

613
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,210
can say who did the thing?

614
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,030
What's this all about?

615
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,490
And the answer is Pat.

616
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,330
What did Pat do?

617
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,130
Comfort, terrorized.

618
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,910
Who do they do it too?

619
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,310
Who was the object?

620
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,780
It's Chris.

621
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,350
What was the result?

622
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,949
Chris felt better.

623
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,260
Chris felt worse.

624
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,639
So these representations already
give us a question and

625
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:22,219
answering capability that makes
for an understanding of

626
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,760
the sentence.

627
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
But still, we haven't been very
specific, so our next

628
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,310
step takes this same sentence in
a more specific direction.

629
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,770
So here's a way that goes.

630
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,300


631
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,469
Kissed Chris.

632
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,530
Now, you begin to get a sense of
what's going on, you form a

633
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,629
mental image, so you could
have a hallucination.

634
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,920


635
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,870
And that hallucinations will
also be a kind of frame, but,

636
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,570
in this case, it'll be
a trajectory frame.

637
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,570


638
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,475
And the object would be, I
don't know, Pat's lips.

639
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:16,230


640
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:23,450
And the destination will
be Chris' lips.

641
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,670


642
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,490
I don't know, is that right?

643
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,400
It depends.

644
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,350
It depends.

645
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,800
Have you all formed a picture
of what's going on here?

646
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,080
So it will be different
depending on whether Chris is

647
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:47,970
Pat's girlfriend or if Chris is
Pat's daughter or if Chris

648
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,830
is a frog and Pat is a prince
-ess, I guess, the way the

649
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,080
story usually goes.

650
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080


651
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,080
So somehow we have, in our
heads, all kinds of libraries

652
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,490
that help us to form mental
pictures of things when we see

653
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,470
things like kissed.

654
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,870
So one final one just
to show the variety.

655
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,920
We could say that Pat
stabbed Chris.

656
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,670


657
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,410
What changes?

658
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,550
Let's see, in the case of
kissed, the mood is going up.

659
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,760
In the case of stabbed, the
mood is going down.

660
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,710
You can also probably say that
the health is going down.

661
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,750
And the destination
is Chris' body.

662
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,310


663
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,700
And the object that's moving
is Pat's knife.

664
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,660


665
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,460
We get the same pattern with
both of those sentences.

666
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,060
So both of them involve a
sequence that starts off with

667
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,080
the action, moves to a
transition and a trajectory

668
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,140
and those are all arranged
in a line.

669
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,790
And that line is something that
gives us a lot of power

670
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,460
over the situation relative
to a semantic net.

671
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,360
So I'm going to decorate that
one more time, and say that

672
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,580
another element we
get out of our

673
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,160
internal language is sequence.

674
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,110
An element we need in order to
have anything that looks like

675
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,510
an account of an inner
language is sequence.

676
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,370
Because if you think about
things being arrayed in a vast

677
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,520
spreading network, it's hard
to deal with them.

678
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,320
But if you thing about things
being arrayed along a line, in

679
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,490
a sequence of actions or events,
like so, then that

680
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,530
imposes enough constraint
to get a handle on

681
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,330
what's going on.

682
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,050
So what we're going to call this
is the representation,

683
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:56,100
and I guess I'm up to one,
two, three, four.

684
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,130
This is a representation
of story sequence.

685
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:06,660


686
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,420
so even though that's a kind of
micro-story, it's still an

687
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,510
example of a story sequence
because we get the power out

688
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,406
of it by arranging everything
in a line.

689
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:20,400
You have a sense, I think,
especially if you play a

690
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
musical instrument, on how
dependent we are on sequence.

691
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,580
So if you play a musical
instrument, you probably know

692
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,270
how difficult it is to start
replaying a piece of music

693
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,380
from the middle of a measure.

694
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,440
You have to go back to at least
the beginning of the

695
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,545
measure, and probably to the
beginning of the phrase, if

696
00:38:37,545 --> 00:38:39,330
not the beginning
of the piece.

697
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,880
So our memory seems to be, at
least in music, very rooted in

698
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,250
the idea of sequences.

699
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,475
And that's often true
of storytelling too.

700
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:52,100
We have to go back to the
beginning of at least a scene,

701
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,260
because somehow these things are
arranged in sequences that

702
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:03,070
form, somehow, usefulness out
of their sequentialness.

703
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,280
So there's one more thing we can
talk about and that is the

704
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,920
idea of not just the idea of
how these sequences are

705
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,840
constructed and what they're
constructed out of, but we can

706
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,300
also talk a little bit in terms
of libraries of stories.

707
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:27,640


708
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,840
And when we talk about libraries
of stories, we can

709
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,350
think about kind of the sort
of standard stories that we

710
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,290
have and how they're arranged,
and how we can know a lot

711
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,840
about something by what
it's super class is.

712
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,770
So it's a variation on the theme
of learning stuff from

713
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,520
the super classes.

714
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,840
So here's an event frame.

715
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,780


716
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,990
And then, in addition
to event frames,

717
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,260
there's disaster frames.

718
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,700


719
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,950
And then there are
party frames.

720
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,320


721
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,010
And parties and disasters
are both events.

722
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,520
And when we talk about
disasters, we know, in turn,

723
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,630
they break up in a variety
of things.

724
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:22,805
We have earthquake disasters,
and maybe we have hurricanes.

725
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:27,890


726
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,440
And in the party world we have,
I don't know, birthday

727
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,300
parties, and we have weddings.

728
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,310


729
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,920
And each of these types of
frames invites us to fill in

730
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,050
particular slots.

731
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,910
So if we're reading a newspaper
story about a

732
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,730
wedding, we know that we're
going to be learning the same

733
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,870
sorts of things we will learn
about any party except there

734
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,790
is the additional information
that we expect that says

735
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,040
something about the bride
and the groom.

736
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:10,220


737
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,150
If we have a raw event and we
don't know anything more about

738
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,630
it than that, there's
a time and place.

739
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,480


740
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,800
If it's a disaster frame, it
gets a grizzly over here, but

741
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,080
if there's a disaster frame, we
might have the fatalities,

742
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,800
and how much it cost.

743
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,800
If it's an earthquake frame, we
need to know the magnitude

744
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,920
of the quake, and the
name of the fault.

745
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,540


746
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:53,050
If it's a hurricane, we have
the category and the name.

747
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,140


748
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,040
So each of these things up there
can be viewed, not just

749
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,690
an example of something, but as
a new frame all by itself.

750
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,500
As we mature, we have these
first four things as building

751
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,470
blocks, and then, we educate
ourselves, and we get all

752
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,370
those kinds of frames
that help us to

753
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,290
understand the world.

754
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:24,150
But how to fill those in from
a newspaper story can be

755
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,780
sometimes, quite a challenge.

756
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,910
Actually the worst thing to
understand is children's

757
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:36,820
stories because, and this was
determined experimentally when

758
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,350
people tried to understand
children's stories, because it

759
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:45,450
turns out that children's
stories are not simpler than

760
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,540
the stories we write
for adults.

761
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,550
In many cases, they're harder.

762
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,350
If you read about Shakespearean
plots, it's all

763
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,360
about intrigue, murder,
jealousy, greed, but when

764
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,540
you're trying to write a
children's story it can be

765
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,300
about anything.

766
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:08,200
And worse yet, the children's
story often raises problems

767
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,830
that you don't see in
newspaper stories.

768
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,080
Let me illustrate
that for you.

769
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:19,310


770
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,560
You want to read that story?

771
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,080


772
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,670
You have no trouble figuring it
out, of course, but think

773
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,090
about a poor machine.

774

It's struggling to understand
anything.

775
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,820
What's going to be
the problem?

776
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,010


777
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,700
It's going to have trouble
figuring out those pronoun

778
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,480
antecedents.

779
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:39,990
Look at them.

780
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,240
They're complicated.

781
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,620

Oh, that's the way.

[INAUDIBLE].

788
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,640


789
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,000
Here are the pronouns.

790
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,940
One of them wanted
to buy a kite.

791
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,240
He has one, he said.

792
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,230
He will make you take it back.

793
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,030
So that's pretty hard.

794
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,790
Actually, the principal here
that I'm driving at is, when

795
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,750
you have a new story or any
story, if you have an old

796
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,080
story but you want to read
it-- when you want to

797
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,350
understand it quickly, the
instantiation of it quickly,

798
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,980
you need to be sure that, if
you're the storyteller, you

799
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,650
don't add to the burden of the
understanding any syntactic

800
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,840
difficulty.

801
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,790
So that's an example of
telling a story with

802
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,470
additional syntactic
difficulty.

803
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,360
No newspaper journalist
would ever write

804
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,000
the story like that.

805
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,790
Here's how they would
write it.

806
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:47,760


807
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,130
They would even give you a
clue that there's certain

808
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,720
information you're never
going to get, like

809
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,600
who told the story.

810
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,070
It's that reliable
sources business.

811
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,550
So this brings us to the final
bit that I want to deal with

812
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,150
today, and what I'm going to do
is, if you came into this

813
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,660
class today as a 97 pound
writing weakling, you're about

814
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,730
to emerge as a 250 pound
mountain of a writer.

815
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,630
Because I want to tell you a few
tricks that will make you

816
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,540
usually better as a writer,
especially if

817
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,200
you're Russian or German.

818
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,120
And here's how it works.

819
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,370
Rule one.

820
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:44,920


821
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,640
Because they place additional
syntactic burden on the

822
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,520
understanding of the story
by the reader.

823
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,450
So if you're telling somebody
about some difficult new

824
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,740
technical idea, the last thing
you want them to do is to

825
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,990
burden their syntactic processor
with figuring out

826
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,040
pronoun antecedents.

827
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,240
So don't use pronouns in you're
writing, technical

828
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,800
writing, at least, will
be much clearer.

829
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,490
By the way, why does this
especially apply to Germans

830
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,230
and Russians?

831
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,980
Is it because--

832
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,900
is this an ethnic origin
slur or is this a

833
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,310
fact about their language?

834
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,370
It's a fact about
their language.

835
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,380
Where is the fact?

836
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,570
Why can they get away with
pronoun usages that we cannot

837
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,910
get away with in English?

838
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:26,470
Yes, Andrew?

839
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,802
STUDENT: Gender and also--

840
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:35,240
PATRICK WINSTON: Gender, because
if you have all of

841
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:42,530
your nouns decorated with
gender, that reduces by three,

842
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,960
the potential for ambiguity
in the pronoun antecedent.

843
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,540
So you'll frequently find that
German and Russian writers

844
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,970
will have pronouns all over the
place that are perfectly

845
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,930
clear to them because
of gender.

846
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,170
They are interpretable by
English speakers when

847
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,890
translated because we don't
have the gender to

848
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,720
help us zero in.

849
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,890
So these things all have to
do with minimizing extra,

850
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,170
superfluous, gratuitous,
unnecessary

851
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,330
burden on the reader.

852
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:13,775
Number two is don't use
former or latter.

853
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:16,950


854
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,660
You see those words used
frequently in technical

855
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,310
writing, and guess what?

856
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,400
No human being ever encounters
those words without having to

857
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,370
stop and go back to figure out
what they refer to it.

858
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,970
So that's another example of
not placing any unnecessary

859
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,370
syntactic burden
on the reader.

860
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:41,500
And finally, don't call
a shovel a spade.

861
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,000


862
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,680
There's a habit, probably
instilled by well-meaning but

863
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,500
misadvised high school teachers,
that you shouldn't

864
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,530
repeat words, and so people go
to great lengths to use some

865
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,830
different word.

866
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,640
The problem is that the reader
doesn't know if the shift in

867
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,640
the word is deliberate and
attached to some subtle

868
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,320
meaning shift, or if it's just
adhering to some high school

869
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,720
teacher's admonition against
using the same word again.

870
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,540
So you don't want to say, oh,
the right way to dig this

871
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,230
particular hole is with a spade
and then switch to a

872
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,350
shovel because the reader can't
tell if it's deliberate,

873
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,840
accidental, or a consequence of
just the desire not to use

874
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,450
the same word.

875
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,510
So this is how you, with some
very simple mechanisms

876
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,660
grounded in AI, you can actually
make yourself into a

877
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,280
better writer by avoiding those
kinds of things that put

878
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,700
an unnecessary syntactic burden
on the people who are

879
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,950
reading your stuff.

880
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:57,504
