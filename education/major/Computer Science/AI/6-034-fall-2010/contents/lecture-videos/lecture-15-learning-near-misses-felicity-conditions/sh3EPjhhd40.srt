1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,870


2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,000
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
You know, some

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,406
of you who for instance--

4
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:19,640
I don't know, Sonya,
Krishna, Shoshana--

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,240


6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,390
some of you I can count on
being here every time.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,710
Some of you show up
once in a while.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,650
The ones of you who show up once
in a while happen to be

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,320
very lucky if you picked today,
because what we're

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,350
going to do today is I'm going
to tell you stuff that might

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,850
make a big difference
in your whole life.

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,870
Because I'm going to tell
you how you can

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,810
make yourself smarter.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,610
No kidding.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,730
And I'm also going to tell you
how you can package your ideas

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,610
so you'll be the one that's
picked instead

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,660
of some other slug.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,240
So that's what we're
going to do today.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,450
It's the most important lecture
of the semester.

20
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,850
The sleep lecture is only the
second most important.

21
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,300
This is the most important.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,740
Now the vehicle that's going
to get us there is a

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,170
discussion about how it's
possible to learn in a way

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,110
that is a little reminiscent
of what we

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,540
talked about last time.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,120
Because last time we learned
something very definite from a

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,289
small number of examples.

28
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:15,220
This takes it one step further
and shows how it's possible to

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,830
learn in a human-like way from
a single example in one shot.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,880
So it's extremely different,
very different from everything

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,270
you've seen before.

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,050
Everything that involves
learning from thousands of

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,340
trials and gazillions of
examples and only learning a

34
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,300
little tiny bit, if anything,
from each of them.

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,550
This is going to
learn something

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,800
definite from every example.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,400


38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,400
So here's the classroom
example.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,080
What's this?

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,090
It's an arch.

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,330
I know the architects are
complaining that it's not an

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,150
arch in architecture land.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,340
It's a post and lintel
construction.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,780
But for us today it's
going to be an arch.

45
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,700
Now if you were from Mars and
didn't know what an arch was,

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,610
I might present this to you and
you'd get a general idea

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,020
of some things that might be
factors, but you'd have no

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,230
idea what's really important.

49
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,040
So then I would say,
that's not an arch.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,900
And you would learn something
very definite from that.

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,470
And then I would shove these
together and put this back on,

52
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,690
and I would say, that's
not an arch either.

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,470
And you'd learn something
very definite from that.

54
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,530
And then I could paint the top
one blue, and you'd learn

55
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,920
something very different
from that.

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,050
And how can that happen
is the question?

57
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,130
How can that happen in detail,
and what might it mean for

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,780
human learning and how you can
make yourself smarter?

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,350
And that's where we're
going to go.

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,020
All right?

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,620
So how can we make a program
that's a smart as a martian

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,610
about learning things
like that?

63
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,020
Well, if you were writing that
program, surely the first

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,710
thing you would do is you'd try
to get off the picture as

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,870
quickly as possible and into
symbol land where things are

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,430
clearer about what the
important parts are.

67
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,120
So you'd be presented with an
initial example that might

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,370
look like this.

69
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,630


70
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,880
We'll call that an example.

71
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,750


72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,079
And it's more than
just an example.

73
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,329
It's the initial model.

74
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,829


75
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,900
That's the starting point.

76
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,470
And now we're going to couple
that with something that's not

77
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,710
actually an arch but looks a
whole lot like one, at least

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,530
on the descriptive level to
which we're about to go.

79
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,590
So here's something that's not
an arch, but its description

80
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,430
doesn't differ from that
of an arch very much.

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,262
In fact, if we were to draw this
out in a kind of network,

82
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:57,780
we would have a description
that looks like this, and

83
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,980
these relations would be
support relations.

84
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,280


85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,640
And this would be drawn
out like so.

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,640
And the only difference
would be--

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,950
the only difference would be
that those support relations

88
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,570
that we had in the
initial model--

89
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,060
the example--

90
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,100
have disappeared down out here
in this configuration.

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,790
But since it's not very
different from the model,

92
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,240
we're going to call
this a near miss.

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:36,630


94
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,670
And now, you see, we've
abstracted away from all the

95
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,800
details that don't
matter to us.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Last time we talked about a
good representation having

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,970
certain qualities--

98
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,050
qualities like making the
right things explicit.

99
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,300
Well, this makes the structure
explicit, and it suppresses

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,159
information about blemishes
on the surface.

101
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,540
We don't care much about how
tall the objects are.

102
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,180
We don't think it matters
what they're made of.

103
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,050
So this is a representation that
satisfies the first of

104
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,210
the criteria from last time.

105
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,460
It makes the right
things explicit.

106
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,830


107
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,990
And by making the right things
explicit, it's exposing some

108
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,440
constraint here with
respect to what it

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,370
takes to be an arch.

110
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,460
And we see that if those support
relations are missing,

111
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,410
it's not an arch.

112
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,510
So we ought to be able to learn
something from that.

113
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,870


114
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,170
What we're going to do is we're
going to put these two

115
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,170
things together.

116
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,880
We're going to describe the
difference between the two.

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,510
And we're going to reach the
conclusion that since there's

118
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,040
only one difference--

119
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,250
one kind of difference with
two manifestations to

120
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,860
disappearing support relations,
we're going to

121
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,940
conclude that those support
relations are important.

122
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,830
And we're going to
turn them red

123
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,140
because they're so important.

124
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,640
And we're going to change the
name from "support" to "must

125
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,130
support."

126
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,250
So this is our new model.

127
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,380
This is an evolving model that
now is decorated with

128
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,590
information about what's
important.

129
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,570
So if you're going to match
something against this model,

130
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,700
it must be the case that those
support relations are there.

131
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,960
If it's not there-- if they're
not there, it's not an arch.

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,750
All right?

133
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,830
So we've learned something
definite

134
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,070
from a single example.

135
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,330
This is not 10,000 trials.

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,490
This is a teacher presenting
something to the student and

137
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,040
the student learning something
immediately in one step about

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,740
what's important in an arch.

139
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,550
So let's do it again.

140
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,580
That was so much fun.

141
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,830
Let's do this one.

142
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,930


143
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,970
Same as before except that now
when we describe this thing,

144
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,880
there are some additional
relations--

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,070
these relations, and those
are touch relations.

146
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,860


147
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,310
So now when we compare that--

148
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,340
is that an arch?

149
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,360
No.

150
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,610
It's a near miss.

151
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,720


152
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,370
When we compare that near miss
with our evolving model, we

153
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,210
see immediately that once again
there's exactly one

154
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,580
difference, two

155
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,190
manifestations, the touch relations.

156
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,650
So we can immediately conclude
that these touch relations are

157
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,490
interfering with our belief that
this could be an arch.

158
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,330
So what do we do with that?

159
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,210
We put those together
again and we build

160
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,680
ourselves a new model.

161
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,730
It's much like the old model.

162
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,920
It still has the imperatives
up here.

163
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,159
We have to have the
support relations.

164
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,740
But now down here-- and we draw
not signs through there--

165
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,159
these are must not
touch relations.

166
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,500


167
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,300
So now you can't match against
that model if those two side

168
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,360
supports are touching
each other.

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,630
So in just two steps, we've
learned two important things

170
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,780
about what has to be in place in
order for this thing to be

171
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,720
construed to be an arch.

172
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,160
So our martian is making
great progress.

173
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,860
But our martian isn't through,
because there's some more

174
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,210
things we might want
it to know about

175
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,170
the nature of arches.

176
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:16,510
For example, we might present
it with this one.

177
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,830
Well, that looks just like
our initial example.

178
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,720
It's an example just like
our initial example.

179
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,360
But this time the top has
been painted red.

180
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,380
And I'm still saying that
that's an arch.

181
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,490
So once again, there's only
one difference and that

182
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,570
difference is that in the
description of this object, we

183
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,330
have the additional information
that the color of

184
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,480
the top is red.

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,000
And we've been carrying along
without saying so, that the

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,750
color of the top in the evolving
model is white.

187
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,920


188
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,900
So now we know that the top
doesn't have to be white.

189
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,920
It can be either red or white.

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,480
So we'll put those
two together and

191
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,600
we'll get a new model.

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,440
And that new model this
time once again

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,600
will have three parts.

194
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,380
It will have the relations, an
imperative form that we've

195
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,760
been carrying along now, the
must support and the must not

196
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,220
touch, but now we're going to
turn that color relation

197
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,520
itself into an imperative.

198
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
And we're going to say that
the top has to be

199
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,200
either red or white.

200
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,290


201
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,330
So now, once again, in one step
we've learned something

202
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,540
definite about archness.

203
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,300
Two more steps.

204
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,190
Suppose now we present
it with this example.

205
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,400


206
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,650
It's an example.

207
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,670


208
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,030
And this time there's going
to be a little paint

209
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,020
added here as well.

210
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,790
This time we're going to have
the top painted blue like so.

211
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,060
So the description
will be like so.

212
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:22,540


213
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,520
And now we have to somehow put
that together with our

214
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,620
evolving model to make
a new model.

215
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,080
And there's some choices here.

216
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,640
And our choice depends somewhat
on the nature of the

217
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,000
world that we're working in.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,990
So suppose we're working
in flag world.

219
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,080
There are only three colors--

220
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,410
red, white, and blue.

221
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,590
Now we've seen them all.

222
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,700
If we've seen them all, then
what we're going to do is

223
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,220
we're going to say that the
evolving model now is adjusted

224
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,250
yet again like so.

225
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,690
Oh-- but those are imperatives
still.

226
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,940
Let me carry that along.

227
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,230


228
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,110
At this time, this guy--

229
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,790
the color relation--

230
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,960
goes out here to anything
at all.

231
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,660
So we could have just not drawn
it at all, but then we

232
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,510
would have lost track of the
fact that we've actually

233
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,260
learned that anything
can be there.

234
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,290
So we're going to retain the
relation but have it point to

235
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,620
the "anything goes" marker.

236
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,170
Well, we're making great
progress and I said there's

237
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,480
just one more thing to go.

238
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,640
So let me compress that
into this area here.

239
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,400
What I'm going to add this time
is I'm going to say that

240
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:46,320
the example is like everything
you've seen before except that

241
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,510
the top is now one of those
kinds of child's bricks.

242
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,280
So you have a choice actually
about whether this

243
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,840
is an arch or not.

244
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,710
But if I say, yeah, it's still
an arch, then we'd add a

245
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,130
little something to
its description.

246
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,080
So this description would
look like this.

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,260
Same things that we've seen
before in terms of support,

248
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,950
but now we'd have a relation
that says that

249
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,240
this top is a wedge.

250
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,260


251
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,460
And over here--

252
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,220
something we've been carrying
along but not writing down--

253
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,640
this top is a block.

254
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,600
A brick, I guess in the
language of the day.

255
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,800
So if we say that it can be
either a wedge or a brick on

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,390
top, what do we do with that?

257
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,430
Once again, it depends on the
nature of representation, but

258
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,980
if we say that we have a
representation, that has a

259
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,000
hierarchy of parts.

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,500
So bricks and wedges are both
children's blocks and

261
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,760
children's box or toys.

262
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,830
Then we can think of drawing
in a little bit of that

263
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:55,090
hierarchy right here and
saying well, let's see.

264
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:02,670
Immediately above that we've
got the brick or wedge.

265
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,000


266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,600
And a little bit above
that we've got block.

267
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,190
And a little bit above
that we've got toy.

268
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,980
And a little bit above that
we eventually get to

269
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,060
any physical object.

270
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,480
So what does it do in response
to that kind of situation?

271
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
You have the choice.

272
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,830
But what the program I'm
speaking of actually did was

273
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,750
to make a conservative
generalization up here just to

274
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,140
say that it's one
of those guys.

275
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,280
So once again it's learned
something definite.

276
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,680
Let me see.

277
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,590
Let me count the steps.

278
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,540
One, two, three, four, five.

279
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,950


280
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,780
And I just learned
four things.

281
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,290
So the generalization of a
color, it took two steps to

282
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,300
get all the way up
to "don't care."

283
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,460
So note how it contrasts with
anything you've seen in a

284
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,840
neural net.

285
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,990
Or anything you will see
downstream in some of the

286
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,280
other learning techniques that
we'll be talking about that

287
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,000
involve using thousands of
samples to learn what it is--

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,130
to learn whatever it is that
is intended to be learned.

289
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,030


290
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,890
Let me show you another
example of how these

291
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,360
heuristics can be put to work.

292
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:37,280


293
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,510
So there are two sets
of drawings.

294
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,110
We have the upper set
and the lower set.

295
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,360
And your task, you smart
humans working in vast

296
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,100
parallelism, your task is to
give me a description of the

297
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,740
top trains that distinguishes
and separates them from the

298
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,990
trains on the bottom.

299
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:09,540


300
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,790
You got it?

301
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,740


302
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,690
Nobody's got it?

303
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, let me try one on you.

304
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,830
The top trains all have a short
car with a closed top.

305
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,010


306
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,235
So how is it possible that
a computer could have

307
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,450
figured that out?

308
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,380
It turns out that it figured
it out with much the same

309
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,220
apparatus that I've shown you
here in connection with the

310
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,640
arches, just deployed in a
somewhat different manner.

311
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,680
In this particular case, the
examples are presented one at

312
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,750
a time by a teacher
who's eager for

313
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,610
the student to learn.

314
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,950
In this case, the examples are
presented all at once and the

315
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,720
machine is expected to figure
out a description that

316
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,820
separates the two groups.

317
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,070
And here's how it works.

318
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,950


319
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:16,210
What you do is you start
with one of them.

320
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,570
But you have a lot of them.

321
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,530
You have some examples--

322
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,700
we'll call the examples on top
the "plus examples" and the

323
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,500
examples on the bottom the
"negative examples." So the

324
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,020
first thing that you do is you
pick one of the positive

325
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,810
examples to work with.

326
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,790
Anybody got any good guesses
about what we're

327
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,640
going to call that?

328
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah, you do.

329
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,730
We're going to call
that the seed.

330
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,310


331
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,770
It's just highly reminiscent of
what we did last time when

332
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,790
we were doing [? phonology ?]

333
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,785
but now at a much
different level.

334
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:51,350
We're going to pick one of those
guys to be the seed, and

335
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,000
then we're going to take these
heuristics and we're going to

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,690
search for one that loosens this
description so that it

337
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,510
covers more of the positives.

338
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,390
You see, if you have a seed that
is exactly a description

339
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,010
of a particular thing and you
insist that everything be just

340
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,750
like that, then nothing will
match except itself.

341
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,098
But you can use these heuristics
to expand the

342
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:17,800
coverage of the description, to
loosen it so that it covers

343
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,540
more of the positives.

344
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,700
So in your first step you might
cover, for example, that

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,810
group of objects.

346
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,860
Too bad for your side, you've
also in that particular case

347
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,600
included a negative example in
your description, but perhaps

348
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,070
in this next step beyond that
you'll get to the point where

349
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,020
you've eliminated all of those
negative examples and zeroed

350
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,160
in on all the positive
examples.

351
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,810
So how might a program be
constructed that would do that

352
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,500
sort of thing?

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,140
Well, think about the choices.

354
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,920
The first choice that you have
it is to pick a positive

355
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,950
example to be the seed.

356
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,650


357
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,880
And once you've picked a
particular example to be the

358
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,350
seed, then you can apply
heuristics, all of them that

359
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,820
you have, to make a new
description that may cover the

360
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,530
data better.

361
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,350
It may have more of the
positives and fewer of the

362
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,150
negatives than in your
previous step.

363
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,880
But this, if you have a lot of
heuristics, and these are a

364
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,850
lot of heuristics because
there's a lot of description

365
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,250
in that set of trains, there
are lots of possible things

366
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,100
that you could do with those
heuristics because you could

367
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,820
apply them anywhere.

368
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,990
So this tree is extremely
large.

369
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,870


370
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,080
So what do you do to keep
it under control?

371
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,240
Well, now you have answers
to questions like that by

372
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,480
knee-jerk, right?

373
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,680
The branching factor
is too big.

374
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,810
You want to keep a few
solutions going.

375
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,700
You have some way of measuring
how well you're doing so you

376
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,130
can use a beam search.

377
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,880
This piece here was originally
worked out by a friend of

378
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,930
mine, now, alas, deceased,
[? Rashad ?]

379
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,610
[? Malkowski ?]

380
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,000
when he was at the University
of Illinois.

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,355
And of course, he wasn't
interested in toy trains, he

382
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:12,150
was just interested in
soybean diseases.

383
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,080
And so this exact program was
used to build descriptions of

384
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,960
soybean diseases.

385
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,170
It turned out to be
better than the

386
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,420
plant pathology books.

387
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,920


388
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,200
We now have two ways of
deploying the same heuristics.

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,210
But my vocabulary is in need
of enrichment, because I'm

390
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,880
talking about "those"
heuristics.

391
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,010
And one of the nice things
that [? Malkowski ?]

392
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,490
did for me a long time ago is
give each of them a name.

393
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,160
So here are the names that
were developed by

394
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,510
[? Malkowski. ?]

395
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,240
What's happening here?

396
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,430
You're going from an original
model to an understanding--

397
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,550
some things are essential.

398
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,140
So he called this the "require
link" heuristic.

399
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,590


400
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,860
And here in the next step, we're
forbidding some things

401
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,290
from being there.

402
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,070
So [? Malkowski ?]

403
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,510
called that heuristic the
"forbid link" heuristic.

404
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,310


405
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,080
And in the next step, we're
saying it can be

406
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,500
either red or white.

407
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,850
So we have a set of colors
and we're extending it.

408
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:29,400


409
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,010
And over here in this heuristic,
going from red or

410
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,090
white to anything goes, that's
essentially forgetting about

411
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,250
color altogether, so we're going
to call that "drop link"

412
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,680
even though for reasons of
keeping track, we don't

413
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,420
actually get rid of it.

414
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,210
We just have it pointing to
the "anything" marker.

415
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,950
And finally, in this last step,
what we're doing with

416
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,090
this tree of categories is we're
climbing up it one step.

417
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,900
So he called that the "climb
tree" heuristic.

418
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,070


419
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,670
So now we have a vocabulary
of things we can do in the

420
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,950
learning process, and having
that vocabulary gives us power

421
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,470
over it, right?

422
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,130
Because those are names.

423
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,686
We can now say, well, what
you need here is

424
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,360
the "drop link" heuristic.

425
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,910
And what you need over there is
the "extend set" heuristic.

426
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,860
So now I want to back up
yet another time and

427
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,850
say, well, let's see.

428
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,870
When we were working with that
phonology stuff, all I did was

429
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,350
generalize.

430
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,090
Are we just generalizing here?

431
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,560
No.

432
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,780
We're both generalizing
and specializing.

433
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,520
So when I say that the links
over here that are developed

434
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,050
in our first step are
essential, this is a

435
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,710
specialization step.

436
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,760


437
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,560
And when I say they can't be--

438
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,880
they cannot be touch
relations, that's a

439
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,130
specialization step.

440
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,880


441
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,480
Because we're able to match
fewer and fewer things when we

442
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,090
say you can't have
touch relations.

443
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,940
But over here, when I go here
and say, well, it doesn't have

444
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,640
to be white.

445
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,220
It can also be red.

446
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,470
That's a generalization.

447
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,280


448
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,970
Now we can match more things.

449
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,210
And when I drop the link
altogether, that's a

450
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,460
generalization.

451
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,170


452
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,005
And when I climb the tree,
that's a generalization.

453
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:40,150


454
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,770
And that's why when I do this
notional picture of what

455
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,030
happens when [? Malkowski ?]

456
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,380
program does a tree search to
find a solution to the train

457
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,680
problem, they're both
specialization steps which

458
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,740
draw in the number of things
that can be matched, and

459
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,485
generalization steps that
make it broader.

460
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:58,180


461
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,670
So, let's see.

462
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,530
We've also got the notion
of near miss.

463
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,220
And we've got the notion
of example--

464
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,450
some of these things
are examples,

465
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,890
some are near misses.

466
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,090
We've got generalization
specialization.

467
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,290
Does one go with one or the
other, or are they all mixed

468
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,330
up in their relationship
to each other?

469
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,490
Can you generalize and
specialize with near misses?

470
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,310
What do you think?

471
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,570
You think--

472
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,146
you don't think so,
[INAUDIBLE]?

473
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:28,132
What do you think?

474
00:23:28,132 --> 00:23:29,611
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

475
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,104
specialization.

476
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,090
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
[INAUDIBLE] lead to

477
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,569
specialization.

478
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:35,050
Let's see if that's right.

479
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,380
So we've got specialization
here, and that's a near miss.

480
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,050
We've got specialization here,
and that's a near miss.

481
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:49,430
We've got generalization here,
and that's an example.

482
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,540
And we've got generalization
here, and that's an example.

483
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,550
And we've got generalization
here, and that's an example.

484
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,000
So [INAUDIBLE] has got
that one nailed.

485
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,650
The examples always generalize,
and the near

486
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,910
misses always specialize.

487
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,580
So we've got apparatuses in
place that allow us to both

488
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,910
expand what we could match and
shrink what we could match.

489
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,380
So what has this got
to do anything?

490
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,260
Well, which one of these methods
is better, by the way?

491
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,920
This one--

492
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,780
this one requires a teacher
to organize everything up.

493
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,320
This one can handle
it in batch mode.

494
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,600
This one is the sort of thing
you would need to do with a

495
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,900
human because we don't
have much memory.

496
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,970
That one is the sort of thing
that a computer's good at

497
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,790
because it has lots of memory.

498
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,690
So which one's better?

499
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,010
Well, it depends on what
you're trying to do.

500
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,425
If you're trying to build a
machine that analyzes the

501
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,610
stock market, you might
want to go that way.

502
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,540
Or soybean diseases, or
any one of a variety

503
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,290
of practical problems.

504
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,440
If you're trying to model
people, then maybe this is a

505
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,690
way that deserves additional
merit.

506
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,450
How do you get all
that sorted out?

507
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,840
Well, one way to get it all
sorted out is to talk in terms

508
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:12,875
of what are sometimes called
"felicity conditions." So when

509
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,570
I talk about felicity
conditions, I'm talking about

510
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,980
a teacher and a student
and covenants that

511
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,710
hold between them.

512
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,655
So here's the teacher.

513
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:26,100


514
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,090
That's me.

515
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,340
And here's the student.

516
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,980


517
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,230
That's you.

518
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,270


519
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:44,200
And the objective of interaction
is to transform an

520
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:57,560
initial state of knowledge into
a new state of knowledge

521
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,465
so that the student is smarter
and able to make use of that

522
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:11,565
new knowledge to do things that
couldn't be done before

523
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:13,950
by the student.

524
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,655
So the student over here
has a learner.

525
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:22,150


526
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,005
And he has something that
uses what is learned.

527
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:29,310


528
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,620
And the teacher over
here has a style.

529
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,890


530
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,720
So if any learning is to take
place, one side has to know

531
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,230
something about the
other side.

532
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:52,440
For example, it's helpful if
the teacher understands the

533
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
initial state of the student.

534
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,050
And here's one way of
thinking about that.

535
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:16,830


536
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,350
You can think of what you know
as forming a kind of network.

537
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,750
So initially, you don't
know anything.

538
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,780
But as you learn, you start

539
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,295
developing quanta of knowledge.

540
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:37,620


541
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,360
And these quanta of knowledge
are all linked together by

542
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,410
prerequisite relationships that
might indicate how you

543
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,130
get from one quantum
to another.

544
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,200
So maybe you have generalization
links, maybe

545
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,560
you have specialization links,
maybe you have combination

546
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,420
links, but you can think of what
you know as forming this

547
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,590
kind of network.

548
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,640
Now your state of knowledge at
any particular time can then

549
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,700
be viewed as a kind of wavefront
in that space.

550
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,020
So if I, the teacher, know where
your wavefront is, can I

551
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,990
do a better job of teaching
you stuff?

552
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,510
Sure, for this reason.

553
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:20,130
Suppose you make a mistake,
m1, that depends on q1.

554
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,600
Way, way behind your
wavefront.

555
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,230
What do I do if I know
that you made a

556
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,935
mistake of that kind?

557
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:30,620
Oh, I just say, oh, you forgot
you need a semicolon after

558
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,450
that kind of statement.

559
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,710
I just remind you of something
that you certainly know, you

560
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,560
just overlooked.

561
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
Right?

562
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,030
On the other hand, suppose you
make a mistake that depends on

563
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,620
a piece of knowledge
way out here.

564
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,590
That kind of mistake, m2.

565
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,075
What do I say to you then?

566
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:52,480
What do you think, Patrick?

567
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,245
What do you think I would
say if you made

568
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:55,021
that kind of mistake?

569
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,969
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

570
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:57,943
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: No.

571
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:02,813
That's not what I would
say [INAUDIBLE].

572
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,248
STUDENT: You'd tell us that
we don't know that yet.

573
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:07,196
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: I
would say something like that.

574
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:10,140
What [INAUDIBLE] suggested
I would say.

575
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,470
Oh, don't worry about that.

576
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,420
We'll get to it.

577
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,770
We're not ready for it yet.

578
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,030
So in this case, I remind
somebody of something they

579
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,360
already know.

580
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,370
In this case, I tell them
they'll learn about it later.

581
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,550
So what do I do with mistake
number three?

582
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,710
That's the learning moment.

583
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,960
That's where I can push
the wavefront out.

584
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,550
Because everything's in
place to learn the

585
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,770
stuff at the next radius.

586
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,770
So if I know that the student
has made a mistake on that

587
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,490
wavefront, that's when I say,
this is the teaching moment.

588
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,500
This is when I explain
something.

589
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,290
So that's why it's important for
the teacher to have a good

590
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,860
model of where the
student is in the

591
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,110
initial state of knowledge.

592
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,910


593
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,970
Next thing that's important for
the teacher to know is the

594
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,220
way that the student learns.

595
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,290
Because if the student is a
computer, they can handle the

596
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,030
stuff in batch.

597
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,280
That's one thing.

598
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,810
If the student is a third
grader who has a limited

599
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,880
capacity to store stuff, then
that makes a difference in how

600
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,370
you teach it.

601
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,260
You might teach it that way to
the third grader, and that

602
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,080
way, buried underneath this
board, to a computer.

603
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,810
So you need to understand the
way that the learner--

604
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,130
the computational capacity
of the learner.

605
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,610
And there's also a need to
understand the computational

606
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:38,160
capacity of the user box down
there, because sometimes you

607
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,120
can be taught stuff that
you can't actually use.

608
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,550
So by now, most of you have
attempted to read that

609
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,920
sentence up there, right?

610
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,690
And it seems screwy, right?

611
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,970
It seems unintelligible,
perhaps?

612
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,350
It's a garden path sentence.

613
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,750
It makes perfectly good English,
but the way you

614
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,300
generally read it, it doesn't,
because you have a limited

615
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,580
buffer in your language
processor.

616
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,000
What does this mean?

617
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,130
You're expecting this to
be "to." Question.

618
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,680
But it's actually a command.

619
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,820
Here's the deal.

620
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,560
Somebody's got to give the
students their grades.

621
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,700
Well, we can have their
parents do it.

622
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,650
Have the grades given
to their students by

623
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,340
their parents, then.

624
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
So it's a command.

625
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,970
And you garden path on it,
because you have limited

626
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,230
buffer space in your
language processor.

627
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,310
So with parentheses you
can understand it.

628
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,520
You can learn about it.

629
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,150
You can see that it's good
English, but you can't

630
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,100
generally process that kind of
sentence without going back

631
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,450
and starting over.

632
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,140
And what about going
the other way?

633
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,670
Are there covenants that we have
to have here that involve

634
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,900
the student understanding some
things about the teacher?

635
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,210
Well, first thing there
is is trust.

636
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,690
The student has to presume that
the teacher is teaching

637
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,420
the student correct
information,

638
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,460
not lying to student.

639
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,700
Ratified that you're all here
because presumably you all

640
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,700
think that I'm not trying to
screw you by telling you stuff

641
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,540
that's a lie.

642
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,990
There's also this sort
of thing down here.

643
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,440
Understanding of the
teacher's style.

644
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,590
So you might say, well,
professor x, all he does is

645
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,230
read slides to us in
class, so why go?

646
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,760
You wouldn't be entirely
misadvised.

647
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,530
That's an understanding
of one kind of style.

648
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,620
Or you can say, well, old
Winston, he tries to tell us

649
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,040
something definite and convey a
family of powerful ideas in

650
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,830
every class.

651
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,590
So maybe it's worth dragging
yourself out of bed at 10

652
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,850
o'clock in the morning.

653
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,850
Those are style issues, and
those are things that the

654
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,500
student uses to determine how
to match the student's style

655
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,370
against that of the
instructor.

656
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:48,330
So that helps us to interpret or
think about differences in

657
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,010
style so that we can appreciate
whether we ought to

658
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,800
be learning that way, where
that way is the way that's

659
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,520
underneath down here, the way
you would teach a computer,

660
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,970
the way [? Malkowski ?]

661
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,600
taught a computer about
soybean diseases.

662
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,090
We can do it that way, or we
can do it this way with a

663
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,570
teacher who deliberately
organizes and shapes the

664
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,150
learning sequence for the
benefit of a student who has a

665
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,260
limited processing capability.

666
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,680
Now you're humans, right?

667
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,910
So think about what the machine
has to do here.

668
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,570
The machine--

669
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,380
in order to learn anything
definite in each of those

670
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,490
steps, the machine has to
build a description.

671
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,410
So it has to describe the
examples to itself.

672
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,450
That's unquestioned, right?

673
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,460
Because what it's doing is
looking at the differences.

674
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,420
So it can't look at the
differences unless it's got

675
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,670
descriptions of things.

676
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,480


677
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,630
So if you're like the machine,
then you can't learn anything

678
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,200
unless you build descriptions.

679
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,140
Unless you talk to yourself.

680
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,030
And if you talk to yourself,
you're building the kind of

681
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,340
descriptions that make
it possible for

682
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,850
you to do the learning.

683
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,220
And you say to me, I'm
an MIT student.

684
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,640
I want to see the numbers.

685
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
So let me show you
the numbers.

686
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,290
And when I'm going
to show numbers--

687
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,400
the numbers that I'm going to
show you show you the virtues

688
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,600
of talking to yourself.

689
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,190
So here's the experiment.

690
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,750
The experiment was done by a
friend of mine, Michelene Chi.

691
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,170
Always seems to go by
the name Mickey Chi.

692
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:38,130


693
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,460
There he is.

694
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,340
So here's the deal.

695
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,580
The students that she worked
with were expected to learn

696
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,989
about elementary physics.

697
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,060
801 type stuff.

698
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,719
And she took eight subjects,
and she had them--

699
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,820
she took them through a bunch of
examples and then she gave

700
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,220
them an examination.

701
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,400
So eight subjects, and so they
divide into two groups.

702
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,890
The bottom half and
the top half.

703
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,750
The ones who did better than
average and the ones who did

704
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,320
worse than average.

705
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,740
So then you can say, well,
OK, what did that mean?

706
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,940
You can say, how much did
they talk to themselves?

707
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,680
Well, that was measured by
having them talk out loud as

708
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
they solved the problems
on an examination.

709
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,440
So we could ask how much self
explanation was done by the

710
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,470
smart ones versus the
less smart ones?

711
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,830
And here are the results.

712
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,620
The worst ones-- the worst four
said about 10 things to

713
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,390
themselves.

714
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,530
The best four said about 35
things to themselves.

715
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,470
That's a pretty dramatic
difference.

716
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:48,290
Here's the data in a more
straightforward form.

717
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,840
This, by the way, points out
that the smart ones scored

718
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,870
twice as high as the
less smart ones.

719
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,870
And when we look at the number
of explanations they gave

720
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:01,760
themselves in two categories,
smart ones said three times as

721
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,460
much stuff to themselves
as the less smart ones.

722
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,760
So, as you can see, the
explanations break down into

723
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,170
two groups.

724
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,770
Some have to do with monitoring
and not with

725
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,760
physics at all.

726
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,010
They're things like,
oh hell, I'm stuck.

727
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,250
Or, I don't know what to do.

728
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,490
And the others have to
do with physics.

729
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,550
Things like, well, maybe I
should draw a force diagram.

730
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,340
Or let me write down f equals
ma, or something like that, as

731
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,200
physics knowledge.

732
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,975
I think it's interesting that
this average score is

733
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:41,080
different by a factor of two,
and the average talking to

734
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,580
oneself differed by
a factor of three.

735
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,280
Now this isn't quite there,
because what's not clear is if

736
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,900
you encourage somebody to talk
to themself, and they talk to

737
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,570
themselves more than they would
have ordinarily, does

738
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,770
that make them score better?

739
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,280
All we know is that the ones who
talk to themselves more do

740
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,890
score better.

741
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,510
But anecdotally, talking to
some veterans of 6.034,

742
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,240
they've started talking to
themselves more when they

743
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,065
solve problems, and they think
that it makes them smarter.

744
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:11,830


745
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,490
Now I would caution you not to
do this too much in public.

746
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,590
Because people can get the
wrong idea if you talk to

747
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,430
yourself too much.

748
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,350
But it does seem--

749
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:29,270
it does, in fact,
seem to help.

750
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,260
Now what I did last time
is I told you how

751
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,750
to be a good scientist.

752
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,890
What I'm telling you now is how
to make yourself smarter.

753
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,160
And I want to conclude this hour
by telling you about how

754
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,670
you can package your ideas so
that they have greater impact.

755
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,720
So I guess I could have said,
how to make yourself more

756
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,430
famous, but I've limited
myself to saying how to

757
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,570
package your ideas better.

758
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,010
And the reason you want to
package your ideas better is

759
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,260
because if you package your
ideas better than the next

760
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,630
slug, then you're going to get
the faculty position and

761
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,130
they're not.

762
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,050
If you say to me, I'm
going to be an

763
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,310
entrepreneur, same thing.

764
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,950
You're going to get the venture
capitalist money and

765
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,580
the next slug won't if you
package your ideas better.

766
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,920
So this little piece of work
on the arch business got a

767
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,600
whole lot more famous than
I ever expected.

768
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,310
I did it when I was young and
stupid, and didn't have any

769
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,400
idea what qualities might emerge
from a piece of work

770
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,240
that would make it well known.

771
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,160
I only figured it
out much later.

772
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,310
But in retrospect, it has five
qualities that you can think

773
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,950
about when you're deciding
whether your packaging of your

774
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,240
idea is in a form that will
lead to that idea becoming

775
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,490
well known.

776
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,340
And since there are five of
them, it's convenient to put

777
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:51,520
them all on the points
of a star like so.

778
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,790
So quality number one.

779
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,870
I've made these all into s-words
just to make them

780
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,720
easier to remember.

781
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,390
Quality number one is that
there's some kind of symbol

782
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,270
associated with a work.

783
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,560
Some kind of visual handle
that people will use to

784
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,760
remember your idea.

785
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,890
So what's the visual
symbol here?

786
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,200
Well, that's astonishingly easy
to figure out, right?

787
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,140
That's the arch.

788
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,110
For years without my
intending it, this

789
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,670
was called arch learning.

790
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,840
So you need a symbol.

791
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,760
Then you also need a slogan.

792
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,940


793
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,820
That's a kind of
verbal handle.

794
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,180
It doesn't explain the idea,
but it's enough of a handle

795
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,280
to, as Minsky would say, put you
back in the mental state

796
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,920
you were in when you understood
the idea in the

797
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,540
first place.

798
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,430
So what is the slogan
for this work?

799
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,760
Anybody have any ideas?

800
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,745
Pretty obvious.

801
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:59,727
What's essential to this
process working?

802
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,212
The ability to present an
example is very similar

803
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:05,616
[INAUDIBLE], that constitutes
a model but

804
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:06,820
isn't one of those.

805
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,310
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

806
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,780
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
So it's a near miss.

807
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:17,620


808
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,700
The next thing you need if your
work is going to become

809
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,300
well known is a surprise.

810
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:29,550


811
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,180
What's the surprise
with this stuff?

812
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,050
Well, the surprise--

813
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,310
everything that had been done
in artificial intelligence

814
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,800
having to do with learning
before this time was

815
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,120
precursors to neural nets.

816
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,490
Thousands of examples
to learn anything.

817
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,410
So the big surprise was that it
was possible for a machine

818
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,950
to learn something definite
from each of the examples.

819
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,810
So that now goes by the name
of one shot learning.

820
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,890
That was the surprise, that a
computer could learn something

821
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,680
definite from a single
example.

822
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,120
So let's see.

823
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,630
We've almost completed
our star.

824
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,120
But there are more
points on it.

825
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,370
So this point is the salient.

826
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,530


827
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,680
What's a salient--

828
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,930
what's a salient idea?

829
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,400


830
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,996
Jose, do you know what
a salient idea is?

831
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:20,912


832
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:24,800
He's too shy to tell me.

833
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,716
What's a salient idea?

834
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:30,065
Ah, who said important?

835
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:31,550
Wrong answer, but very good.

836
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,025
You're not shy.

837
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,510
So what does it really mean?

838
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,500
Yes.

839
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,490
STUDENT: Relative to
what somebody's

840
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,470
already thinking about?

841
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,955
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Relative to what somebody's

842
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:41,450
thinking about.

843
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,700
Not quite.

844
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,380


845
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,360
If you have a--

846
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,610
if you're an expert in--

847
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,825


848
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:54,815
yes?

849
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

850
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,795
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Really close.

851
00:41:56,795 --> 00:42:00,260
We're getting closer.

852
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,250
[INAUDIBLE].

853
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,745
Yes?

854
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:04,467
STUDENT: Maybe an idea that
wasn't obviously apparent, but

855
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:08,740
becomes apparent gradually as
somebody starts to understand?

856
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,660
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: We're
zeroing-- we're circling

857
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,040
the wagons here and
zeroing in on it.

858
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,978
Yes?

859
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:15,730
STUDENT: If I'm preempting what
you're about to say, it

860
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,455
has sort of a doorway of how you
can understand the idea.

861
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:19,954
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
It's what?

862
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,453
Sorry.

863
00:42:20,453 --> 00:42:22,948
STUDENT: It's sort of like
a doorway of how you

864
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:26,940
can grasp the idea.

865
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,250
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
That's sort if it, too, but if

866
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,700
you study military history,
what's the salient on a fort?

867
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,020


868
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,090
Well, this is a good word to
have in your vocabulary

869
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,850
because it sort of means all of
those things, but what it

870
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,850
really means is something
that sticks out.

871
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,660
So on a fort, if this were a
fort, these would all be

872
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,380
salients because
they stick out.

873
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,020
So the salient idea is
usually important

874
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,870
because it sticks out.

875
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,780
But it's not-- the meaning is
not "important," the meaning

876
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,300
is "stick out."

877
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,180
So a piece of work becomes
more famous if it has

878
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,130
something that sticks out.

879
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,930
It's interesting.

880
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,840
There are theses that have been
written at MIT that have

881
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,090
too many good ideas.

882
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,190


883
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,160
And how can have too
many good ideas?

884
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,170
Well, you can have too many
good ideas if no one idea

885
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,120
rises above and becomes the idea
that people think about

886
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,310
when they think about you.

887
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,130
We have people on the faculty
who would have been more

888
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,280
famous if their theses
had fewer ideas.

889
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,530
It's amazing.

890
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,670
So this piece of work
did have a salient.

891
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,390
And the salient idea was that
you could get one shot

892
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,920
learning via the use
of near misses.

893
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,290
That was the salient idea.

894
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,660
The fifth thing, ah.

895
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,600
Talk more about this
in my "How to

896
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,960
Speak" lecture in January.

897
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,950
The fifth thing I like people
to try to incorporate into

898
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,020
their presentations
is a story.

899
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,000


900
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,290
Because we humans somehow
love stories.

901
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,610
We love people to
tell us stories.

902
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,260
We love things to be packaged
in stories.

903
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,920
And believe me, I think all of
education is essentially about

904
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,850
storytelling and story
understanding.

905
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,480
So if you want your idea to
be sold to the venture

906
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,850
capitalist, if you want to get
the faculty job, if you want

907
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,940
to get your book sold to a
publisher, if you want to sell

908
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,720
something to a customer, ask
yourself if your presentation

909
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,300
has these qualities in it.

910
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,230
And if it has all of those
things, it's a lot more likely

911
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,120
to be effective than
it doesn't.

912
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,550
And you'll end up
being famous.

913
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,030
Now you say to me, well, being
famous-- that sounds like the

914
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,020
Sloan School type of concept.

915
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,990
Isn't it immoral to
want to be famous?

916
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,570


917
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,270
Maybe that's a decision
you can make.

918
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,880
But whenever I think about the
question, I somehow think of

919
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,730
the idea that your ideas
are like your children.

920
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,050
You want to be sure that they
have the best life possible.

921
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,390
So if they're not packaged
well, they won't.

922
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:06,670
I'm also reminded of an evening
I spent at a soiree

923
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,400
with Julia Child.

924
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,600
Julia, and there's me.

925
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,770
And I have no idea how
come I got to sit

926
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,700
next to Julia Child.

927
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,600
I think they thought I was
one of the rich Winstons.

928
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,250
The Winston flowers, or the
Harry Winston diamonds or

929
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:23,960
something like that.

930
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,700
There I was, sitting next
to Julia Child.

931
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,940
And the interesting thing--

932
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,379
by the way, did you notice
I'm now telling a story?

933
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:36,120
The interesting thing about this
experience was that there

934
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,760
was a constant flow
of people--

935
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,410
happened to be all women--

936
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,430
people going past Ms. Child
saying how wonderful she was

937
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,840
to have made such an enormous
change in their life.

938
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,340
Must have been 10 of them.

939
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,190
It was amazing.

940
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,250
Just steady flow.

941
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,730
So eventually I leaned over to
her and I said, Ms. Child, is

942
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,130
it fun to be famous?

943
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,930
And she thought about it
a second and said,

944
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,360
you get used to it.

945
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,380
And that had a profound effect
on me, because you always say,

946
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,810
well, what's the
opposite like?

947
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,330
Is it fun to be ignored?

948
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:20,950
And the answer is, no, it's not
much fun to be ignored.

949
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,990
So yeah, it's something you can
get used to, but you can

950
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,180
never get used to having your
stuff ignored, especially if

951
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,610
it's good stuff.

952
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,270
So that's why I commend
to you this business

953
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,160
about packaging ideas.

954
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,770
And now you see that 6034
is not just about AI.

955
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,140
It's about how to
do good science.

956
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,220
It's how to make yourself
smarter, and how to make

957
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,470
yourself more famous.

958
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:53,413
