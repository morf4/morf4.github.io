1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,890


2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,320
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: I was
in Washington for most of

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,050
the week prospecting for gold.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,820
Another byproduct of that was
that I forgot to arrange a

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,330
substitute Bob Berwick for
the Thursday recitations.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,070
I shall probably go
to hell for this.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,830
In any event, we have
many explanations,

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,670
none of them good.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,680
But today we'll try to get back
on track and you'll learn

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,800
something fun.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,060
In particular you will learn how
a graduate student of mine

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,940
Mark [? Phillipson ?], together
with a summer UROP

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,980
student, Brett van Zuiden,
one of you--

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,710


15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,390
managed to pull off a tour de
force and recognize in these

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,610
two descriptions the pattern
that we humans commonly call

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,860
"revenge." It was discovered.

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,090
The system didn't have a
name for it, of course.

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,160
It just knew that there was a
pattern there and sat waiting

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,340
for us to give a name to it.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,635
That's where we're
going to end up.

22
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,840
But it'll be a bit of a journey
before we get there,

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,039
because we've got to
go through all that

24
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,250
stuff on the outline.

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,740
And in particular, we want
to start off by a

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,910
little tiny bit of review.

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,310
Because some of the stuff
we did last time

28
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,440
went by pretty fast.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,630
In particular, you may remember
they had this

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,220
wonderful joint probability
table, which tells us all we

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,229
want to know, all
we want to know.

32
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,950
We can decide what the
probability of the police

33
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,520
being called is given the this
and the that, and all that

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,080
sort of stuff, by clicking
the appropriate boxes.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,920
The trouble is, gee, there are
only three variables there.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,560
And when there are lots of
variables it gets pretty hard

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,010
to make up those numbers or
to even collect them.

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,550
So we're driven to
an alternative.

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,890
And we got to that alternative
just at the end of

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,210
the show a week ago.

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:21,750
And we got to the point where
we were defining these

42
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,370
inference nets, sometimes called
"Bayes nets." And the

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,579
one we worked with
looked like this.

44
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,060
There's a burglar, a raccoon,
the possibility of a dog

45
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,500
barking, the police being
called, and a trash can being

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,720
overturned.

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,620
So more variables than that.

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,579
That only has three.

49
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,420
This has got five.

50
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,590
But we're able to do some magic
with this because we, as

51
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,960
humans, when we define--

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,130
when we draw this graph we're
making an assertion about how

53
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,740
things depend or don't depend
on one another.

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,410
In particular, there's something
to break down and

55
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,240
memorize to the point where
it rolls off your tongue.

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
And that is that any variable on
this graph is said by me to

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,310
be independent of any other

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,500
non-descendant given its parents.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,770
Independent of any

60
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,690
non-descendant given its parents.

61
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,930
So that means that the
probability of the dog

62
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,340
barking, given its parents,
doesn't depend on T, the trash

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,930
can being overturned.

64
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,900
Because the intuition is all
of the causality is flowing

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,800
through the parents and can't
get to this variable D without

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,440
going through the parents.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,680
So that is [? inserted ?]

68
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,290
property of the nets
that we draw.

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,960
And we tend to draw them in a
way that reflects causality.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
So it tends to make sense.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,329
So somehow this thing
is going to be--

72
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,710
we're going to use this thing
instead of that thing.

73
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,880
But wait.

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,920
We may need that thing in
order to do all the

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,530
computations we want
to perform.

76
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,930
So we need to be able to show
that we can get to that thing

77
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,160
by doing calculations
on this thing.

78
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,300
So what to do?

79
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,100
Well, we're going to
use the chain rule.

80
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,450
And remember that the chain rule
came to us by way of the

81
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,250
basic Axioms of Probability
plus the definition plus a

82
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,580
little colored chalk.

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,570
So we got to the point
last time where we

84
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,750
sort of believed this.

85
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,920
It's a really magical thing.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,670
It says that the probability
of all this stuff happening

87
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,170
together is given as the
product of a bunch of

88
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,470
conditional probabilities.

89
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,380
And the conditional
probabilities in this product

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,430
are arranged such that this
first guy depends

91
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,500
on everybody else.

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,050
The second guy doesn't depend
on the first guy but depends

93
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,690
on everything else.

94
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,850
So that list of dependencies
gets smaller and smaller as

95
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,380
you go down here until it
depends only one thing.

96
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,050
There's no conditional at all.

97
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,780
So that's going to come to our
rescue because it enables us

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,210
to go from calculations in
here to that whole table.

99
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,740
But first I have to show you a
little bit more slowly how

100
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,720
that comes to be.

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,800
One thing I'm going to do
before I think about

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,650
probability is I'm going to
make a linear list of all

103
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,330
these variables.

104
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,290
And the way I'm going to make
it is I'm going to chew away

105
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,030
at those variables
from the bottom.

106
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,810
I've taken advantage
of a very important

107
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,630
property of these nets.

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,490
And that is there no loops.

109
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,090
You can follow the arrows
in any way so as

110
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,470
you get back to yourself.

111
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,200
So there's always going
to be a bottom.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, well, there are

113
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,409
two bottoms here, there's C
and T. So I have a choice.

114
00:05:53,409 --> 00:06:02,330
I'm going to choose C. So I'm
going to take that off and

115
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,570
pretend it's not
there anymore.

116
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,980
Then I'm going to
take this guy.

117
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,430
That's now a bottom because
there's nothing below it.

118
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,430
I've already taken C out.

119
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,590
So we'll take that out next.

120
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,440
And now I've got this guy,
this guy, and this guy.

121
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,170
This guy no longer has
anything below it.

122
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,430
So I can list it next.

123
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,590
Now over here I've got
raccoon and trashcan.

124
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,450
But trashcan is at the bottom.

125
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,040
So I've got to take it next
because I'm working

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,011
from the bottom up.

127
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:40,760
I want to ensure that there are
no descendants before me

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,940
in this list.

129
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,780
So finally I get to raccoon.

130
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,930
So the way I constructed this
list like so ensures that this

131
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,020
list arranges the elements so
that for any particular

132
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,210
element, none of
its descendants

133
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,460
appear to its left.

134
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,300


135
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,260
And now that's the magical order
for which I want to use

136
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,030
the chain rule.

137
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,960
So now I can write--

138
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,260
I can pick C to be
my variable n.

139
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,530
And I can say that the chain
rule says that the joint

140
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,410
probability of all these
variables P of C,

141
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,140
D, B, T, and R--

142
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,360
the probability of any
particular combination of

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,140
those things is equal to the
probability of C given

144
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,390
everybody else.

145
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,659


146
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:38,190
Next in line is D given
everybody else.

147
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,470


148
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,400
Next in line is T--

149
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,420
next in line is B given
everybody else.

150
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:57,380


151
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,720
And next in line is T given
everybody else.

152
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,270


153
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:10,840
And finally, just R. So this
combination of things has a

154
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,145
probability that is given by
this chain rule expression.

155
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,960


156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,010
Ah.

157
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,500
But first of all, none of those
expressions condition

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,740
any of the variables on
anything other than

159
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,970
non-descendants, all right?

160
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,650
That's just because of the way
I've arranged the variables.

161
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,950
And I can always do that
because are no loops.

162
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,169
I can always chew away
at the bottom.

163
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,140
That ensures that whenever I
write a variable, it's going

164
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,440
to be conditioned on stuff other
than its descendants.

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,190
So all of these variables in
any of these conditional

166
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,700
probabilities are
non-descendants.

167
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,740
Oh wait.

168
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,510
When I drew this diagram, I
asserted that no variable

169
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,680
depends on any non-descendant
given its parents.

170
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,950
So if I know the parents of
a variable I know that the

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,895
variable is independent of all
other non-descendants.

172
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,320
All right?

173
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,590
Now I can start scratching
stuff out.

174
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,690
Well, let's see.

175
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,120
I know that C, from my diagram,
has only one parent,

176
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,080
D. So given its parent, it's
independent of all other

177
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,730
non-descendants.

178
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,980
So I can scratch them out.

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,370


180
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,470
D he has two parents, B and R.
But given that, I can scratch

181
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,720
out any other non-descendant.

182
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,190


183
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,460
B is conditional on T and R.
Ah, but B has no parent.

184
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,120
So it actually is independent
of those two guys.

185
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,330
The trashcan, yeah, that's
dependent on R. And R over

186
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,640
here, the final thing in the
chain, that's just a

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,160
probability.

188
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,390
So now I have a way of
calculating any entry in that

189
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,960
table because any entry in that
table is going to be some

190
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,880
combination of values for
all those variables.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
Voila.

192
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,320
So anything I can do with a
table, I can do in principle

193
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,580
with this little network.

194
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,920
OK?

195
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,480
But now the question is, I've
got some probabilities I'm

196
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,100
going to have to figure
out here.

197
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,570
So let me draw a slightly
different version of it.

198
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,010


199
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,030
So up here we've got the a
priori probability of B. Well,

200
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:46,680
that's just probability of B.
Down here with the dog, I've

201
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,350
got a bigger table because I've
got probabilities that

202
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,950
depend on the values
of its parents.

203
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,620
The probability of dog barking
depends on the condition of

204
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,560
the parents, nothing else.

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,070
So let's see.

206
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,920
I've got to have a column for
B. I've got to have a column

207
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,940
for the burglar and
the raccoon.

208
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,660


209
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,940
And there are a bunch of
possibilities for those guys.

210
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,050
But once I get those then I'll
be able to calculate the

211
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,670
probability of the
dog barking.

212
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,640


213
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,910
So there are two of
these variables.

214
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,310
So there are four
combinations.

215
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,390
There's T T. There's
T R, R T, and--

216
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,134
whoa, what am I doing?

217
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:34,050
Wake up!

218
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,720
T false.

219
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,930
False true.

220
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,890
And false false.

221
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,060
So what I really want to do is
I want to calculate all of

222
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,070
these probabilities that give
the probability of the dog

223
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,210
condition of the burglar
and the raccoon.

224
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,070
Similarly, I want to calculate
the probability of B happening

225
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,200
doesn't depend on
anything else.

226
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,590
So I don't know what to do.

227
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,660
Well, what I'm going to actually
do is I'm going to do

228
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,410
the same thing I had
to do up there.

229
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,630
I'm going to keep track of--

230
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm going to try a bunch of--

231
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm going to get myself together
a bunch of data.

232
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,910
Maybe I do a bunch
of experiments.

233
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,730
Maybe somebody hands it to me.

234
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,030
But I'm going to use that data
to construct a bunch of

235
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,990
tallies which are going to end
up giving me the probabilities

236
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,150
for all of those things.

237
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,160
So I don't know, let's see.

238
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,440
How should we start?

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,290
Step one, find colored chalk.

240
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,870
Step two, I'm going to extend
these tables a little bit so I

241
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,120
can keep track of the tallies.

242
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,840


243
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,580
So this is going to be all
the ones that end up in a

244
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,980
particular row.

245
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,450
And these are going to be the
ones for which dog is true.

246
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,930


247
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,960
Similarly, I'm going to extend
this guy up here in order to

248
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,020
keep track of some tallies.

249
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,020
This is going to be the ones
for which B is true.

250
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,990


251
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,240
And this one will be all.

252
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,780


253
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,680
So that's my set up.

254
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,490
And now suppose that my first
experiment comes roaring in.

255
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,060
And it's all T's.

256
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,720
So I have T T T. That's my first
experimental result, my

257
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,170
first data item.

258
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,480
So let's see.

259
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,010
The arrangement here is
burglar, raccoon, dog.

260
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,040
So burglar as a true.

261
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,510
And there's one tally
count in there.

262
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,280
Likewise, the T T, that's the
burglar and the raccoon, that

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,190
brings me down to
this first row.

264
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,200
So that gives me one tally in
there and dog is true so that

265
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,475
gives me a tick mark
in that one.

266
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,190
All right?

267
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,240
Are you with me so far?

268
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,850
And now let's suppose
that the next thing

269
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,100
happens be all false.

270
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,940


271
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,020
Well, burglar is false.

272
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,545
But there is one experiment.

273
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,590


274
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,980
Everybody's false.

275
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,500
So we come down here
to false false.

276
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,810
And that's the row we're
going to work on.

277
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,650
We get a tally in there.

278
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,150
Do we put one in here?

279
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,860
No, because that's false.

280
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,785
Dog is false.

281
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,650
That's what our data
element says.

282
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,640
So that's cool.

283
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,050
Maybe one more.

284
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:37,210
Let's suppose we have T T F.
Well in that case, we have a

285
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,020
tick mark here and a tick mark
here because the burglar

286
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,360
element is true.

287
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,040
Then we have T T. That brings
us to the first row again.

288
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,180
So we get a tick mark there.

289
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,500
But dog as false, so
no tick mark there.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,170
That's how it works.

291
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,550
I suppose you'd like to see
a demonstration, right?

292
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,030
Always like to see
a demonstration.

293
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,850
So here's what it actually
looks like.

294
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,680


295
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,060
So on the left you see the
network as we've constructed

296
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,420
it, with a bunch probabilities
there.

297
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,850
And what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to start

298
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,850
simulating away so as to
accumulate tick marks, tally

299
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,160
marks, and see what kinds of
probabilities that they

300
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
indicate for the table.

301
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,610
I happen to be using a process
for which the model on the

302
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,070
left is a correct reflection.

303
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,540
So there's one simulation.

304
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,460
So the dog barking--

305
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,800
let's see, the burglar
is false.

306
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
The raccoon is true.

307
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,710
I get one tick mark.

308
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,130
So the probability
there is one.

309
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,300
Of course, I'm not going
to just go with one.

310
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,840
I want to put a whole bunch
of stuff in there.

311
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,300
So I'll just run a bunch
more simulations.

312
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,820


313
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,270
No [? dice. ?]

314
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,746
I don't even have an entry
at all yet for T F here.

315
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,210
That's because I haven't
run enough data.

316
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,280
So let me clear it instead of
doing it one at a time.

317
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Let me run 100 simulations.

318
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,450
See, it's still not too good.

319
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,500
Because it says this T
T probability true.

320
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,910
This just because I'm feeding
it data, right?

321
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,730
And I'm keeping track of what
the data elements tell me

322
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,470
about how frequently a

323
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,180
particular combination appears.

324
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,680
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

325
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,668
STUDENT: So when you're doing
one simulation, is that

326
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,162
[INAUDIBLE] variables?

327
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:23,832
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: When
I'm doing one simulation,

328
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:26,930
I'm just keeping track of
that combination in

329
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,800
each of these tables.

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,630
Because it's going to tell
me something about the

331
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,730
probabilities that I want
reflected in those tables.

332
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,090
So it's pretty easy to see when
I go up here to burglar.

333
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,920
If I have a lot of data
elements, they're all going to

334
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,730
tell me something about
the burglar as well

335
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,280
as the other variables.

336
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,910
So if I just look at that
burglar thing, the fraction of

337
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,850
time that it turns out true over
all the data elements is

338
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,150
going to be its probability.

339
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,610
So now when I go down to the
joint tables, I can still get

340
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,630
these probability numbers.

341
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,400
But now they're conditioned
on reticular

342
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,010
condition of its parents.

343
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,430
So that's how I get these
probabilities.

344
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,700
So I didn't do too well here
because that T T combination

345
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,579
gave me an excessively
high probability.

346
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,130
So maybe 100 simulations
isn't enough.

347
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,339
Let's run 10,000.

348
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,560
So with that much data running
through, the probabilities I

349
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,310
get-- let's see, I've got 893
here, instead of 0.9, 807

350
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,880
instead of 0.8, 607
instead of 0.6.

351
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,500
And that one's dead-on
at 0.01.

352
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,570
So if I run enough of these
simulations, I get a pretty

353
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,220
good idea what the probabilities
ought to be

354
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,030
given that I've got
a correct model.

355
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,860
OK, so that takes care
of that one.

356
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,880
And of course, I didn't draw
the other things in here.

357
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,800
But by extension, you can see
how those would work.

358
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,180
Oh.

359
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,810
But you know what?

360
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,895
I think I will put a little
probability of

361
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,145
raccoon table in here.

362
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:52,550


363
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,390
Because the next thing I
want to do is I want to

364
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,470
go the other way.

365
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,365
This is recoding tallies
from some process so I

366
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:00,730
can develop a model.

367
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,670
But once I've got these
probabilities, of course, then

368
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,780
I can start to simulate what
the model would do.

369
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,610
All right?

370
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,690
How would I do that?

371
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,220
Well, do I want to use
the same table?

372
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,050
I think just to keep things
sanitary, what I'll do is I'll

373
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,340
go over here and do it again.

374
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,260
Here's B. It's got a probability
of B. Here's R.

375
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:33,300
Here's a table probability of
R. That comes down into a

376
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,070
joint table for dog.

377
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,320
And it's got four elements.

378
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,090


379
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,940
Depending on the burglar
condition and the raccoon

380
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,270
condition, we get a probability
of dog.

381
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,990
And now, imagine these have
all been filled in.

382
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,290
So what do I want to do if I
want to simulate this system

383
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,130
generating some combination of
values for all the variables?

384
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,870
Well, I do the opposite of what
I did when I was working

385
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,070
around with this chain rule
showing that I could go from

386
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,480
the table to those
probabilities.

387
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,660
Now I've got the
probabilities.

388
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,450
I'm going to go the
other direction.

389
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,100
Instead of chewing away from the
bottom, I'm going to chew

390
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,660
away from the top.

391
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,740
Because when I go into the top
and chew way, everything I

392
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,560
need to know to do a
coin flip is there.

393
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,970
So in particular, when I go
up in here, I've got the

394
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,350
probability of burglar now.

395
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,250
So I'm going to use that
probability to flip a coin.

396
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,950
Say it produces a T. So that
takes care of this guy.

397
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,730
And I can now scratch it off
since it's no longer in

398
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,390
consideration.

399
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,940
It's no longer a top variable.

400
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,330
So now I go over into raccoon
and I do the same thing.

401
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,190
I take this probability.

402
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,310
I do a flip.

403
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:59,130
And say it produces an F.
Whatever its probability is, I

404
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,350
flip a biased coin and that's
what I happen to get.

405
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,340
But now, having dealt with these
two guys, that uncovers

406
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,230
this dog thing.

407
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,330
And I've got enough information,
because I've done

408
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,286
everything above, to make the
calculation for whether to dog

409
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:15,510
is going to be barking or not.

410
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,520
But wait.

411
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,530
I have to know that I've got a T
and a T and a T and an F and

412
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,060
an F and a T and an F and an
F. Because I have to select

413
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,820
the right row.

414
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,610
So I know that B is T. And I
know that R is F. So that

415
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,570
takes me into the table
into the second row.

416
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,360
So now I get this probability.

417
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,850
I flip that coin and I get some
result, say, T. Voila.

418
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,810
I can do that with the
other two variables.

419
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,390
And I've got myself an
experimental trial that is

420
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,620
produced in accordance with the

421
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,219
probabilities of the table.

422
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:00,469
OK?

423
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,390


424
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,640
Of course--

425
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,356


426
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:13,730
yeah, in fact, how did
I get those numbers?

427
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,990
Actually what I did is I used
the model on the left to

428
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,330
generate the samples that
were used to compute the

429
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,240
probabilities on the right.

430
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,910
So you've seen that a
demonstration of this already.

431
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,330
Now of course--

432
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,400
I don't know, all of this sort
of depends on having

433
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,030
everything right.

434
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,130
I've written a thing to write
it one more time.

435
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:51,580
Burglar, raccoon, dog, call
the police, trashcan.

436
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,440
But somebody else may say, oh,
you've got it all wrong.

437
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,690
This is what it really
looks like.

438
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,560


439
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,780
The dog doesn't care about
the raccoon at all.

440
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,130
So that's a correct model.

441
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,380
Now when I do a simulation, I
could fill in the tables in

442
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,810
either model, right?

443
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm sure you'd like to
see a demonstration.

444
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,420
So let me show you a
demonstration of that.

445
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:21,470


446
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,040
So there are the two tables.

447
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,060
And I can run 10,000
simulations

448
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,310
on those guys, too.

449
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,530


450
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,270
Now, look.

451
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,150
The guy on the left is a pretty
good reflection of the

452
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,630
probabilities in a model I
used to produce the data.

453
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,253
But the guy on the right doesn't
know any better. it

454
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:42,960
just fills in its
own tables, too.

455
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,950
So what to do?

456
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,060
I say this one's the
right model.

457
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,370
And you say that one's
the right model.

458
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,090
Who's right?

459
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,120
Maybe we'll never know.

460
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,830
And the guy on the left will get
rich in the stock market

461
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,630
and the guy on the right
will go broke.

462
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,370
I would be nice if
we could actually

463
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,520
figure out who's right.

464
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,466
So would you to see how to
figure out who's right?

465
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,220
Yeah, so would I. What we're
going to do is we're going to

466
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,490
look at naive Bayesian
inference.

467
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,660
And that's our next chore.

468
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,740
So here's how it works.

469
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,800
We know, from the definition of
conditional probability, we

470
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,530
know that the probability of
A given B is equal to the

471
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,660
probability of A and
B divided by the

472
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,520
probability of B, right?

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,400
Equal to by definition.

474
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,540
So that means that the
probability of A given B times

475
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,240
the probability of B--

476
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
I'm just multiplying it out--

477
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,050
it equal to that joint
probability.

478
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,690


479
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,715
Oh, but by symmetry, there's no
harm in saying I can turn

480
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:02,450
that around and say that the
probability of B given A times

481
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,000
the probability of B is also
equal to that joint

482
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,690
probability, right?

483
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,750
I've just expanded it a
different and symmetric way.

484
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,630
If I've got to write a, b on
B, b, a on A. Thank you.

485
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,590
Who was complaining?

486
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,840
Good work.

487
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,200


488
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,800
That would have been a
major-league disaster.

489
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,910
But now, having written that, I
can forget about the middle.

490
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,730
Because all I'm really
interested in is how I've

491
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,070
turned the probabilities around
in that conditional.

492
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,570
Why would I care about
doing that?

493
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,760
By the way, we're now talking
about the work of

494
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,010
the Reverend Bayes.

495
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,060


496
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,420
Because we can rewrite this yet
again as the probability

497
00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:00,160
of A given B is equal to the
probability of B given A times

498
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,420
the probability of A divided
by the probability of B.

499
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,790
That's just elementary
algebra.

500
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,460
But now I'm going to do
something magical.

501
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,670
I'm going to say I've got a
classification problem.

502
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,120
I want to know which
disease you have.

503
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,660
That's a classification
problem.

504
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,120
Maybe you've got
the swine flu.

505
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,790
Maybe you've got indigestion.

506
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,740
Who knows.

507
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,470
But I get all these symptoms.

508
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,950
I get all these pieces
of evidence.

509
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,450
You've got a fever.

510
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,140
You're throwing--

511
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,470
oh, well, let's not go into
too much detail, there.

512
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,060
But what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, well, let's

513
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:48,490
suppose that A is equal to a
class that I'm interested in,

514
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,050
the disease you've got.

515
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:56,510
And B is equal to the evidence,

516
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,760
the symptoms I observe.

517
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,540


518
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,240
Voila.

519
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,150
I may have a pretty hard time
figuring out what the

520
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,260
probability of the class
is given the evidence.

521
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,920
But figuring out the probability
of the evidence

522
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,420
given the class might
not be so hard.

523
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,500
Let me get another board in play
and show you what I mean.

524
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,128


525
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:24,820
By plugging class and evidence
into Bayes' rule, what I get

526
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,540
is the probability of some class
given the evidence is

527
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:37,710
equal to the probability of the
evidence given the class

528
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,060
times the probability of the
class divided by the

529
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,690
probability of the evidence.

530
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,280


531
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,230
Now you've got to let that
sing to you a little bit.

532
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,590
Suppose I've got several classes
that I'm trying to

533
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,270
decide between.

534
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm trying to select the best
out of that batch of classes.

535
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,800
Well, I've got the evidence.

536
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,140
And if I know the probability of
the evidence given each of

537
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,130
those classes, and if I know,
a priori, the initial

538
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,950
probability the class,
then I'm done.

539
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,910
Because I've got the two
elements in the numerator.

540
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,590
Why am I done?

541
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,630
Because the denominator is the
same for all the classes.

542
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,490
It's just the probability
of the evidence.

543
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,870
And then I could just
sum everything up.

544
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,440
I know it adds to 1 anyway.

545
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
So that's cool.

546
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,240
But sometimes there's
evidence--

547
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,980
actually there's more than
one piece of evidence.

548
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,660
Let's say that there's
some class.

549
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,330
some i, and we're trying to
figure out if that's the

550
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,720
correct class.

551
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,000
So we've got c sub i there
and c sub i there.

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,420
And suppose that that evidence
is actually a bunch of pieces

553
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,780
of evidence.

554
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:56,580
So it could be e sub
1, e sub n, oops,

555
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,880
premature right bracket.

556
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,430
All that evidence, given the
class i times the probability

557
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,820
of the class i over some
denominator that we don't care

558
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,700
about because it's going to
be the same for everybody.

559
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,110
So we'll just write that as d.

560
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,160
Now what if these pieces of
evidence are all independent

561
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,410
given the class?

562
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,720


563
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,590
So if you have the swine flu,
the probability you have a

564
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,117
fever is independent of the
probability you're going to

565
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:31,610
throw up, say.

566
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,280
Then can we write this
another way?

567
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,150
An easier way?

568
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,580
Sure.

569
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,180
Because when things are
independent, the joint

570
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,330
probability is equal to the
product of the individual

571
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,190
probabilities.

572
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,910
So that is to say--

573
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,670
it's easier to see it if you
write it down than if

574
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,700
you just say it--

575
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,200
this probability here from these
two elements here is

576
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,280
equal to the probability of e
sub 1 conditioned on c sub i

577
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,970
times the probability of e sub
2 conditioned on c sub i, all

578
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,080
the way down to the probability
of e sub n

579
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,800
conditioned on c sub i divided
by some denominator we don't

580
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,480
care about.

581
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,860
See, what I'm going to try to do
is I'm going to go through

582
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,240
this for all the ci and see
which one's the biggest.

583
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,620
STUDENT: That's the [INAUDIBLE]
ci, right?

584
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,390


585
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,070
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: This
is the probability of--

586
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

587
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,870
right-hand side [INAUDIBLE].

588
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,990
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Right here?

589
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,820
Oh yes, you're quite right.

590
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,070
Oh yeah, thanks.

591
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:45,270


592
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,775
I can't write and think
at the same time.

593
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:49,410
Thanks.

594
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:49,770
OK.

595
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,700
So I've just figure out which
one of these is the biggest.

596
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,150
And I've identified the class.

597
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,490
Now you say to me, well, I would
like to see an example.

598
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,870
So--

599
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,050
I don't know, does anyone
have any spare change?

600
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,660


601
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,300
A nickel, a quarter.

602
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,190
This is not because of
infinitesimally low raises

603
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,960
here at MIT.

604
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,180
I just need it for
a demonstration.

605
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
I need two coins.

606
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,140
Don't forget to get these
back, I tend to be--

607
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,280
Now suppose these two coins
are not exactly the same.

608
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,200
One of these points is a
legitimate, highly-prized

609
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,160
American quarter.

610
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,100
The other one is a fake.

611
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,960
And with this one, the
probability of heads, let us

612
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,050
say, is 0.8 instead of 0.5.

613
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,710
So I mix these all up.

614
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,960
And I pick one.

615
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,520
And I start flipping it.

616
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,540
And I get a head.

617
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,390
Then I flip it again.

618
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,040
And I get a tail.

619
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,750
Which coin did I pick?

620
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,480
Well, we're going to use this
stuff to figure it out.

621
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,730
Here's what happens.

622
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:16,940


623
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,500
Before I forget.

624
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,440
Thank you very much.

625
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,430
So what we've done is
we've selected these

626
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,810
things from my hands.

627
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,390
And I can't draw hands.

628
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,210
So I'll draw a little
cup here.

629
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,700
And there are two
coins in here.

630
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,610
And we're going to pick one.

631
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,690
And one has a probability
of heads equal to 0.8.

632
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,913
And this one has a probability
of a head of 0.5.

633
00:31:40,913 --> 00:31:43,480


634
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,900
So here's the draw.

635
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,060
I pick one.

636
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,840
Each has a probability of 0.5.

637
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,260


638
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,020
This one is the one with
the 0.8 as the

639
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,300
probability of head.

640
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,500
And this one is the
one with the

641
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,270
probability of 0.5 as a head.

642
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,570
OK?

643
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:12,910
So now suppose the first flips
as it was is T. Well, that's a

644
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,382
piece of evidence.

645
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:15,310
That's here.

646
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,230
Probably of evidence
given the class.

647
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,240
Well in the case of having drawn
this biased coin, the

648
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,740
probability of coming up with a
tail-- ah, let's say a head,

649
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,890
just to make my numbers
a little easier.

650
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:38,010
Probability of coming out there
with a head is equal 0.8

651
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,810
given that it's up here
in this choice.

652
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:46,265
The probability given that you
have a fair coin is 0.5.

653
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,260


654
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:59,230
So now if we take the next coin
and take it to be a tail

655
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,990
then the probability
of this guy given

656
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,610
that evidence is 0.2.

657
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,900
And the probability of this guy
given that evidence-- it's

658
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,050
a fair coin, so it
doesn't care.

659
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,300
It's still 0.5.

660
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,250


661
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,100
So now what's the probability
of this

662
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,710
class given this evidence?

663
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:25,804
It's the product 0.5 times
0.8 times 0.2.

664
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,590
And what's the probability
of this guy?

665
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:34,800
It's 05 times 0.5 times 0.5,
divided by a denominator which

666
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,520
is the same in both cases.

667
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,230
So let's forget about
this early 0.5 here.

668
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,650
Because it's the same
in both cases.

669
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:48,300


670
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,660
And we just multiply those
numbers together.

671
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,940
That gives us 0.8 times 0.2.

672
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,440
What's that?

673
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,030
0.16?

674
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,010
And this guy, 0.5 times
0.5, that's 0.25.

675
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,610
So it looks an awful lot like--
with this combination--

676
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,050
that I've picked the
coin that's fair.

677
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,260
One more flip?

678
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,870
So let's flip it again,
and suppose we

679
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,498
come up with a head.

680
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,520
So that puts a 0.8 in here.

681
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,170
And 0.5 in here.

682
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:29,590
When you multiply those
out that's 0.125.

683
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,980
And this is 0.128.

684
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,830
So it's about equal.

685
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,333
So you see how that works?

686
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,630
All right.

687
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,560
So we're using the coin flips
as evidence to figure out

688
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,239
which class is involved.

689
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,840
OK so I don't know, you'd
probably like to see a

690
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,370
demonstration of this,
too, right?

691
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:56,270
You say to me, gosh, just
two kinds of coins.

692
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,970
That's not very interesting.

693
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,570
Let's try five kinds of coins.

694
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,660


695
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,650
So what I want to show you is
how the probabilities for all

696
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,130
these coins-- there are five
of them, color-coded--

697
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,700
how the probabilities vary
with a series of flips.

698
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,010
Let's suppose I've
got a head--

699
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,080
the grey line, by the way, is
the fraction of heads--

700
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,820
so that's going to be one.

701
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,500
Because I'm just doing heads.

702
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,830
You see that black
line rising?

703
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,250
Should look like a rocket.

704
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,500
That's the probability
that the--

705
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,060
that's the coin which only shows
heads, the probability

706
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,310
of head is 1.

707
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,760


708
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,370
And I'm flipping a whole
bunch of heads here.

709
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,980
Isn't that cool?

710
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,920
Now what happens if I suddenly
put in a tail?

711
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,280
By the way, you'll no doubt,
here one the extreme left--

712
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,300
the initial probability of
the P=0 coin was 0.1.

713
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,950
As soon as I flipped a
head that went to 0.

714
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,930
And it will never get
off 0, right?

715
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,450
That makes sense.

716
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,570
Because if the probability that
you'll get a head is 1

717
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,760
you should never see a tail.

718
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,030
If you ever do, that
isn't your coin.

719
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,260
What happens now if I interrupt
a series of heads

720
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,957
and produce a tail?

721
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,418
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

722
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:17,392
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?

723
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

724
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,240
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: The
black one will go to 0.

725
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,655
What else happens?

726
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,470
By the way, the blue one is
the one with the highest

727
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,400
probability of being a head.

728
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,670
[INAUDIBLE]

729
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,850
Boom!

730
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,720
That blue one shot up.

731
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,910
Not going up slowly.

732
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,320
It shot up.

733
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,640
Because now the preponderance
of evidence with all those

734
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,130
heads is that I've flipped the
coin with a bias of 0.75

735
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,820
towards heads.

736
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,540
So let's clear this.

737
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,680
Pick any probability you want.

738
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
0.25, 0.5, and so on.

739
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,260
I don't know, let's pick
0.25 since we've been

740
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,510
at the upper end.

741
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,100


742
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,650
So orange is 0.25.

743
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,200
And sure enough, the probability
that I've selected

744
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,900
the 0.5 coin is going up and
up and up and up after the

745
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,540
original irregularity.

746
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,610
The Law of Large Numbers
is setting in.

747
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,030
And a probability that I've got
that 0.25 coin in play is

748
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,660
pretty close to 1.

749
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:16,910
All right.

750
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,360
So that's cool.

751
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,590
Now you say to me, that's
awfully nice but stop.

752
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:30,280
Awfully nice, but not
very real-world-ish.

753
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,520
So let me give you
another problem.

754
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,930
It's well-known that you are,
with high probability, of the

755
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,660
same political persuasion
as your parents.

756
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,620
So if I wanted to figure out
which party a parent belongs

757
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,140
to, I could look at the
party that their

758
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,490
children belong to, right?

759
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,090
So it's just like
flipping coins.

760
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,770
The particular coin
I have chosen

761
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,680
corresponds to the parent.

762
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,620
Individual flips correspond to
the political party that the

763
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,070
child belongs to.

764
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,200
So let's get up a little bit--

765
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,890
by the way, I wrote all this
stuff over the weekend.

766
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,610
So who knows if any
of it will work.

767
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,430
But let's see.

768
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,040
A parent party classifier.

769
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,530
There it is, Democrats
and Republicans.

770
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,330
And now the prior for being a
Republican given here is 0.5.

771
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,920


772
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,300
But I don't know, this is a
little bit Democratic state.

773
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,780
So let's adjust that
down a little bit.

774
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,640
Somewhere in there might be
about right But let's just,

775
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,370
for the sake of a classroom
illustration, go down here.

776
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,650
So now the meter is showing the
prior probability because

777
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,510
that's the only thing in
the formula so far.

778
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,340
I've got no evidence.

779
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,610
So now let's suppose that
child number one is a

780
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,380
Republican.

781
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,850
Back to neutral.

782
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,910
So I've got a low probability
that the parent--

783
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:59,810
a priori probability that the
parent is a Republican and a

784
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,870
child who's a Republican.

785
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,670
I notice that 0.2 and 0.8,
the conditional is 0.8.

786
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,620
And the prior is 0.2.

787
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,690
That's why it comes out to
balance each other, right?

788
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,230
So now if we get another
Republican in

789
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,080
there it goes way up.

790
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,860
If I have a Democratic child
it goes back down.

791
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,180
If I have an equal balance
between children then it goes

792
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,320
way back down because of that
prior probability being low.

793
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,280
So if I make that high, even
though the children are

794
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,865
balanced, I'm still going to
have a high probability of

795
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,250
being a Republican.

796
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,140
Now let's see.

797
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,180
If I take that slider there, the
conditional probability,

798
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,800
and drive it to the left
here-- let me make that

799
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,180
equally in.

800
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,760
And let's make that one thing.

801
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,620
I don't know.

802
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,766
What am I doing now?

803
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:52,460
If I make the probability less
than 0.5, what's that mean?

804
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,510
That means you're sore at your
parents and you want to belong

805
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,720
to a different party.

806
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,200
All right, so now,
what's next?

807
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,650
Oh gosh.

808
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,900
What's next?

809
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,620


810
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,870
This is what's next.

811
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,720


812
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,220
What's next to somewhere?

813
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,440
Yeah, this is what's next.

814
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,210
This here.

815
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,460
We've got two models.

816
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,400


817
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,070
Remember when I said we wanted
to decide between them?

818
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,930
Can we use that Bayesian
hack to do that, too?

819
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,580
Sure.

820
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,790
Because we've got these
two models.

821
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,770
We've got the probabilities
in them.

822
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:42,490
So now I can take my data and
calculate the probability of a

823
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,620
left model given the data and
the probability of the right

824
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,780
model given the data, multiply
that times their a priori

825
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,860
probabilities, which I'll
assume are equal.

826
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,710
Then I can do a model selection
deal much in

827
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,250
defiance to what I was
hinting at before.

828
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,500
so let's try that.

829
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,330


830
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,720
Whoa.

831
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,915
There are my two models.

832
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:10,460
Yes, there they are.

833
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,850
We've already trained them up.

834
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,990
And they've got their
probabilities.

835
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,630
Now what we're going to do
is we're going to use the

836
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,950
original model to simulate
the data.

837
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,350
So what we're going to do is
we're going to simulate draws,

838
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,770
simulate events, similarly
combinations of all variables

839
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,626
using a model that looks like
the one on the left, that is

840
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,530
the one on the left except for
the slight differences in

841
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,320
probabilities, OK?

842
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,570
Then we're going to do this
Bayesian thing and see where

843
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,880
the meter goes.

844
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,020
So we'll run one data point.

845
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,960
Oops, went the wrong way.

846
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Makes me nervous.

847
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,750
I just finished this at 9:15.

848
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,610
Maybe there's a bug.

849
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,720
Oops, two data points,
swings to the left.

850
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,140
Three data points, back
to the right.

851
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,070
Of course that's
not much data.

852
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,685
So let's put some
more data in.

853
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:57,130
Yeah.

854
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,730
Boom, there it goes.

855
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,480
Let's try that again.

856
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,060
That was cool.

857
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:07,050
So let's run 1,000 simulations
and one data point.

858
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,780
It bobbles around a little
bit and goes

859
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,640
flat over to the left.

860
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,630
Because that is the model that
reflects the one that the data

861
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,480
is generated from.

862
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,150
So now we got Bayesian
classification, except now the

863
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,790
classification has gone one
step more and it becomes

864
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,440
structure discovery.

865
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,700
We've got two choices
of structure.

866
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,660
And we can use this Bayesian
thing to decide which of the

867
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,060
two structures is best.

868
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,150
Isn't that cool?

869
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,230
Well, it's only cool if
you could do what?

870
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,950


871
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,710
So if you had two choices--

872
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,210
you can select between them
and pick the best one--

873
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,490
but there are--

874
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,120
gosh, for this number of
variables, there are a whole

875
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,540
lot of different networks that
satisfy the no looping

876
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,952
criteria and don't have
very many parents.

877
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:02,770
There's an awful lot of them.

878
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,450
In fact, if you strict this
network to two parents there

879
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,260
are probably thousands and
thousands of possible

880
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,590
structures.

881
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,840
So do I try them all?

882
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,390


883
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,340
Probably not.

884
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,370
It's too much work when you
get 30 variables or

885
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,320
something like that.

886
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,450
So what do you do?

887
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,740
We know what to do, right?

888
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,390
We're almost veterans a 6034.

889
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,750
We have to search!

890
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,270
So what we do is we take the
loser and we modified it.

891
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,320
And then we modify it again.

892
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:38,120
And we keep modifying it until
we drop dead or we get

893
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,450
something that we're
happy with.

894
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,480
So let's see what happens if
we change this problem a

895
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,030
little bit and do structure
discover.

896
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,740
We're starting out with
nothing linked.

897
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,380
And we're going to just start
running this guy.

898
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,600
So what's going to happen
is that the

899
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,690
good guy will prevail.

900
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,990
And the bad guy will be
a copy of the good guy

901
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,150
perturbed in some way.

902
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,280
So it's a random search.

903
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,380
You'll notice that score--

904
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,170
it's too small for
you to read.

905
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,460
All these things are
too small to read.

906
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,710
Let me make it a
little bigger.

907
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,230


908
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,130
Too small to read, but that
number on the right there is

909
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,240
not the product of the
probabilities, actually.

910
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,850
It's the sum of the logarithms
of the probabilities.

911
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,780
They go together, right?

912
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,440
And the reason you use this
instead of the probabilities

913
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,590
is because these numbers get
so small that was a 32-bit

914
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,740
machine, you eventually lose.

915
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,730
So use the log of the
probabilities rather than the

916
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,630
product of the probabilities.

917
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,660
You use the sum of the logs
instead of the product of the

918
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,840
probabilities.

919
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,210
And eventually, you hope that
this thing converges on the

920
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,760
correct interpretation.

921
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,470
But you know what?

922
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:50,900
This thing is so flat as a space
and so a large and so

923
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,490
telephone pole-like that it's
full of local maxima.

924
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,670
So what this program is doing
is every once in awhile--

925
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,880
I think with probability
1 and 10; I forgot what

926
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,883
parameters I used--

927
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:08,410
every once in awhile, it'll do
a total radical rearrangement

928
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,150
of the structures.

929
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,830
In other words, it's
a random restart.

930
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,820
It keeps track of the
best guy so far.

931
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,370
And every once in awhile it does
a totally random restart

932
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,870
in its effort to search
the space.

933
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:23,130
So that's how you go from
probabilistic inference to

934
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,300
structure discovery.

935
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,560
Now when is this stuff
actually useful?

936
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,600
Well, I hinted at a medical
diagnosis, right?

937
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,890
That's a situation where you've
got some symptoms.

938
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,160
And you want to know what
the disease is.

939
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,470
So as soon as you use the
keyword "diagnosis," you've

940
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,840
got a problem for which this
stuff is a candidate.

941
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,640
So what other kinds of diagnosis
problems are there?

942
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,360
Well, you might be
lying to me.

943
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,350
So I can put a lie
detector on you.

944
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,980
And each of those variables that
are measured by the lie

945
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,370
detector are an independent
indication whether you're

946
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,910
telling the truth or not.

947
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,300
So it's this kind of Bayesian
discovery thing.

948
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,410
Naive Bayesian Classification.

949
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,972
What other kinds of
problems speak to

950
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:11,130
the issue of diagnosis?

951
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,410
Well, we like to know how well
you know the material!

952
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:19,110
So we can use quizzes as
pieces of evidence.

953
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,590
Thank god we don't use exactly
a naive Bayesian classifier,

954
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,600
because then we wouldn't be able
to do that combination.

955
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,020
We have to use a slightly
more complex--

956
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,280
what you can think of as a
slightly more complex Bayesian

957
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,430
net to do that particular
kind of diagnosis.

958
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,950
You might have a spacecraft or
an airplane or other piece of

959
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,950
equipment with all sorts
of symptoms.

960
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,530
You're trying to figure
out what to do next,

961
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,100
what the cause is.

962
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,210
So using the evidence to go
backward to the cause.

963
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,470
So maybe you've got some program
that doesn't work.

964
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,390
Happens to me a lot.

965
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,580
So I use the evidence from the
symptoms of the misbehavior to

966
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,480
figure out what the most
probable cause is.

967
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,020
But now to conclude the day--
last time there weren't any

968
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,890
powerful ideas.

969
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,090
But if you take the combination
of the last

970
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:14,170
lecture and this lecture to be
a candidate for gold star

971
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,740
ideas, these are the ones I'd
like to leave you with.

972
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,750
We got here is--

973
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,420
this Bayesian stuff, all these
probabilistic calculations are

974
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,965
the right thing to do.

975
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:30,270
They're the right way to work
when you don't know anything,

976
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,600
which would make it sound like
you're not very useful,

977
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,890
because you think you always--
well, in fact, there are a lot

978
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,020
of situations where you either
can't know everything, don't

979
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,420
have time to know everything,
or don't want to take the

980
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,630
effort to know everything.

981
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,190
So in medical diagnosis all
you've got is the symptoms.

982
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,730
You can't go in there and figure
out in a more precise

983
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,750
way exactly what's wrong.

984
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,730
So you use the symptoms to
determine what the cause is.

985
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,850
And then all those other kinds
of cases that I mentioned.

986
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,520
But now, what other kinds of
structure discovery are there?

987
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,760
Well, the kind of structure
discovery that I hinted at in

988
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,550
the beginning will be the
subject that we'll begin with

989
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:10,330
during our next and sadly final
conversation here in

990
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,700
[? 10250 ?]

991
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,320
on Wednesday.

992
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,210
It will feature not only a
discussion of how this stuff

993
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,890
can be used to discover patterns
and stories, but

994
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:24,590
we'll also talk about what's
on the final, what kind of

995
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:28,870
thing you could do next, that
sort of thing to finish off

996
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,420
the subject.

997
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,710
And that's the end of
the story for today.

998
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:45,425
